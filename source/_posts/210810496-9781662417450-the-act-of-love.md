            Something is happening, something very peculiar, visions just won't
            let up. Sapphire has been having these visions for far too long,
            what is it about? Why is it happening? The mystery lingers on. At
            only nine years old, these mysteries are still happening. Now that
            she is all grown up, one discovery will lead her to the next
            discovery. Sapphire feels like the light of the world has invoked
            her most inner spirits. With a beyond ordinary gift that she
            inhabits, her light team is constantly guiding her and also helping
            her to understand her purpose, which pretty soon will lead her to
            her destiny. Discovering something sweet and fragile, a gift given
            from the unknown. But despite of her beautiful nature, she must go
            through the motions that are just ahead of her, to fully understand
            the world around her. With such a kind, gentle soul and heart, she
            will stop at nothing to help those along her journey, and it's not
            always sweet. It is ever so challenging. She is aware that life is
            all about experiences, but nothing is ever tickled sweet. She will
            soon learn about a mission, that has been written in the stars.
            Sometimes things can be so simple, dangerous, weird, and
            uncomfortable. But it's a courageous thing, to have the strength and
            power to fear nothing making the effort to see the intention
            through. With the support of her friends, things are about to become
            very strange for her, snatching her out of her comfort zone. It is
            up to Sapphire to show just how strong, powerful, and determined she
            is, but even with that is a challenge within itself. She will have
            to put all of her logical knowledge, wisdom, and faith to the test.
            To see this intent through. Although this may be dangerous, a
            gamble, and maybe even a struggle. But in the end, it will all turn
            out to be sweet. But you'll just have to see to find out! Drama,
            lies, drugs, a violent history, lust, discovery, faith, true love,
            trust, murder, and digging out the truth despite of the nature of
            the circumstance! All simmer into this thing we all call life of
            experiences.
