          "Plenty of self-help books on the market advocate spiritual awakening,
          success, or elements of both; but few can claim the perspective and
          approach of
          <i
            >The Fearless Path: What a Movie Stuntman's Spiritual Awakening Can
            Teach You About Success</i
          >, a survey that comes, surprisingly, from a movie stuntman whose
          spiritual awakening led to a revised vision of the world and his place
          in it after climbing a remote mountain. Part autobiography, part
          self-help guide, and with more than a dash of spiritual reflection and
          self-awareness, <i>The Fearless Path</i> charts an unusual path
          towards success that takes the foundations of the author's early work
          as a stuntman and translates it into the kind of gritty determination
          that leads to overall success in life. In combining what transformed
          his perspective on that mountain with the lessons learned from his
          daredevil life before that point, Curtis Rivers provides a road map to
          the methods of his journeys; not just the course itself. This approach
          allows fellow pilgrims to understand the process of real change:
          '...you attract into your fabulous life the things you think about
          consistently. With enough thought, with enough intent, the feelings
          push through from your weak conscious mind to your infinitely powerful
          subconscious mind. Once the seed is planted in the fertile soil of
          your subconscious mind, you must water the seed, you must take action,
          but the thought will become reality, as sure as spring follows
          winter.' Without the autobiographical elements,
          <i>The Fearless Path</i> could all too easily have become a lecture.
          By including his 'you are there' experiences both on and off the
          mountain, Rivers provides readers with a real opportunity for
          understanding the transformative process itself - and that is a gift
          highly recommended for biography readers, those on spiritual paths,
          and those seeking to translate self-help or spiritual concepts into
          daily living."
