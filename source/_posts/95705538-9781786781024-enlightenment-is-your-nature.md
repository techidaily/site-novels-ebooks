          Explores and explains the fundamental difference between psychology,
          therapy and meditation.<br /><br />"Enlightenment” in Western cultures
          has long been associated with the 18th century movement that brought
          about a new “age of reason.” As Zen, Buddhism, and other eastern
          wisdom traditions have captured the imagination of the West,
          “enlightenment” has come to be known as a specific state of
          consciousness attained by an individual on a spiritual or meditative
          path.<br /><br />However, the Judeo-Christian context, with its belief
          in a divine power “out there” and separate from the individual,
          hinders most Westerners’ ability to comprehend “enlightenment” in the
          Eastern sense. Our theistic conditioning leads to such common
          misunderstandings as perceiving enlightenment as the attainment of
          supernatural powers, or as something achievable only by those who are
          somehow “special.”<br /><br />In this work, Osho deconstructs these
          misunderstandings and offers a radically different view of
          enlightenment, freed from all spiritual and religious beliefs –
          including the distortions of asceticism and renunciation that have
          arisen in Eastern and Western cultures both.<br />Taking the reader
          step by step through the history of how both East and West have
          approached the mysteries of the human mind and spirituality, Osho
          offers a simple science of consciousness that he calls “the psychology
          of the buddhas.” It is a science that in very clear terms shows how
          one can, through awareness and taking full responsibility for one’s
          life, go beyond all limited belief systems, habits, and superstitions
          of the mind. That process, he says, brings us back to our nature – and
          that is enlightenment.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Osho has been described by the&nbsp;<i>Sunday Times&nbsp;</i>in London
          as one of the “1000 Makers of the 20th Century”. About his own work,
          Osho has said that he is helping to create the conditions for the
          birth of a new kind of human being.<br /><br />Running like a thread
          through all aspects of Osho’s talks and meditations is a vision that
          encompasses both the timeless wisdom of all ages past and the highest
          potential of today’s (and tomorrow’s) science and technology.<br /><br />Osho
          is known for his revolutionary contribution to the science of inner
          transformation, with an approach to meditation that acknowledges the
          accelerated pace of contemporary life. His unique OSHO Active
          Meditations are designed to first release the accumulated stresses of
          body and mind, so that it is then easier to take an experience of
          stillness and thought-free relaxation into daily life.
