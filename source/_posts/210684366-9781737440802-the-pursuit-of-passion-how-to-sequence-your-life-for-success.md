            Do you currently or have you ever desired more for your life? The
            world we live in will flaunt and parade success in your face as if
            it's sold at your local market. The fact of the matter is the rags
            to riches story that you were spoon fed is not one that is uniform.
            What if success was more than a story? What if success was a habit?
            And what if that habit was something you could do every day and reap
            and experience the rewards thereof?

            The Pursuit of Passion is a book that seeks to democratize success.
            Being all that you were created to be should not be an opportunity
            for a select few-It should be the standard. Countries were founded
            on this principle. The problem is standardized success is
            anti-status quo. The running theory is everyone cannot be
            successful, there must be the haves and have nots. The people who do
            not have certain things are pacified and neutralized into believing
            that they cannot excel beyond their exigent circumstances. Living in
            lack/want is a mindset. Those who have all they could ever need,
            want, and or ask for are not concerned about not having, they are
            focused on not losing.
          </p>

          <p>
            If life was as easy as you are supposed to believe it is, the world
            would not be in such disarray. You have wants, needs, desires, and
            passions, that are unique to you. The word desire broken down means
            "of the father"; There are things that have been placed in you that
            want to come forth through you. Not every matter is a material one.
            If you can get past stuff and get to purpose, through discipline,
            the stuff will come to you. Regardless of how fair life is or isn't,
            achieving the highest heights of your potential is possible.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The Pursuit of Passion focuses on how to achieve tangible success in
            your personal life in a real way that will have a real impact not
            just directly but indirectly as well. As you begin to grow and
            become better, the people around you will begin to do the same. Real
            success is found in personal development, and as you do the inner
            work necessary to live a life of fullness and wholeness, it will
            manifest itself materially in ways that will take you from one level
            to the next. &nbsp;
