            The true nature of what actually crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in
            1947 remains classified. Only a select few have ever had access to
            the truth about what became known as Area 51.
          </p>
          <p>
            But what happened to the remnants of that crash is shrouded in even
            greater mystery. What began in the high desert of New Mexico ended
            at Wright-Patterson, an ultra-top-secret Air Force base in Dayton,
            Ohio. The physical evidence of extraterrestrial visitation was
            buried deep within this nuclear stronghold. How tragic that such
            seismic news should be kept from the people of the world . . .
            pieces of history, now quickly dwindling into oblivion as the last
            of the secret-keepers passes on.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to its rich history of military service to our nation,
            Wright-Patterson also stands as the secret tomb of one of the
            greatest occurrences in recorded history. Be prepared . . . the real
            Area 51—Wright-Patterson‘s vault—is about to be opened.

          distorted. We should all be truly grateful that we have men like
          Schmitt and Carey who have the persistence and fortitude to expose the
          truth to a world that is largely asleep at the wheel." —<b
