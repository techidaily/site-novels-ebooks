            In Lakota tradition, the bow and arrow were more than tools for
            hunting or battle. The bow’s resilience and flexibility, the arrow’s
            grace and power, the archer’s focus and patience—in these, we find
            the essential qualities for living a life of strength, purpose,and
            simplicity. In The Lakota Way of Strength and Courage, Joseph M.
            Marshall builds upon the central metaphor of the bow and arrow to
            provide a treasury of insights, stories, and irreplaceable wisdom.
            With eloquent prose and an elder’s perspective, Marshall draws from
            traditional stories, the history of the Lakota, and his own
            experiences to offer timeless lessons on:<br />Transformation—what
            the journey of the Lakota people teaches us about preserving what is
            essential as our external circumstances change Simplicity—the story
            of Grandmother Grass Braid, who understood that “the more you know,
            the less you need to carry” Purpose—how the world unveils our
            purpose to us, as revealed in the story of the Keeper of the Winter
            Count Strength—the moving story of Henry One Bull, and how adversity
            teaches us to develop the true core of our strength Resiliency—the
            lessons of Grandma Red Leaf on facing the challenges of life with
            the best we have to offer<br />Once, the Lakota people relied on the
            ash bow and the willow arrow to provide food and sustenance. Today,
            these simple tools can offer us something even more precious: a way
            to nourish our souls with spiritual wisdom. Joseph M. Marshall
            offers a book that is at once profound, honest, and rich with
            meaning as he reveals The Lakota Way of Strength and Courage.
