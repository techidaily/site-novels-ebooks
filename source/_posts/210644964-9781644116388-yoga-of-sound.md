            >A guide to harnessing the vibration that created the universe for
            healing and spiritual awakening</b
          ><br /><br />• Shares profound lessons from Swami Nada Brahmananda, a
          master of the yoga of sound and vibration<br /><br />• Centers on
          three life-enhancing themes: controlling the mind, diet and practices
          conducive to healing and perfect health, and how music can be used to
          transform consciousness and enrich our spiritual life<br /><br />•
          Also paints a vivid portrait of New York City in the 1970s and its
          underground arts and music scene<br /><br />Not long after obtaining
          his Ph.D. in philosophy from Columbia University in 1971, Michael
          Grosso had an extraordinary experience in Greenwich Village, New York,
          that led him to realize he needed to balance his overly intellectual
          life with music. He met Swami Nada Brahmananda, a former court
          musician for the King of Mysore, famous throughout India for being a
          master of Taan music and sound yoga as well as for his supernatural
          control of his body. Grosso began studying with Swami Nada and found
          his life profoundly changed. <br /><br />Sharing the lessons of Swami
          Nada Brahmananda as well as painting a vivid portrait of New York City
          in the 1970s—and its vibrant and chaotic underground arts and music
          scene—Grosso explores Swami Nada’s Indian yoga of sacred sound in
          depth. He reveals how the tradition centers on the sound or vibration
          that created the universe, its personal cultivation, and its power to
          heal, enlighten, and offer insight about how to live in the Kali Yuga,
          the Age of Conflict. Grosso also examines the siddhis, or
          extraordinary powers, that can arise from this work, detailing the
          otherworldly abilities of his master. The lessons that Grosso shares
          center on three life-enhancing themes: controlling the mind, which
          provides the very essence of a happy life; diet and practices
          conducive to healing and perfect health—Swami Nada himself never knew
          a day of sickness in all of his 97 years; and how music in all its
          forms can be used to transform consciousness and enrich our spiritual
          life. <br /><br />Revealing Swami Nada Brahmananda as the very
          embodiment of a Celestial Songman, Grosso shows how, by practicing the
          yoga of sound, we can embody Swami Nada’s greatest lesson of all: that
          we can all learn to make music from the discordant notes of our lives
          and sing our way out of the Kali Yuga.

          “Why do so many people take music either too seriously or not nearly
          seriously enough? <i>Yoga of Sound</i> conveys an essential truth:
          pure music is <i>life</i>, lived to the fullest, and that suggests
          divinity: unlimited and unknown powers. This book may help us
          understand why George Harrison was fond of the saying:
          <i>God likes me when I pray, but loves me when I sing</i>.”
