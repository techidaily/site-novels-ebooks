          Hilaria Baldwin knows what it means to be pulled in many directions—as
          a mother of three, businesswoman, yoga instructor, Instagram
          sensation, and wife of actor Alec Baldwin, she has to work hard to
          remain centered. Through her life experiences, struggles, and personal
          growth, Hilaria has developed a method for using movement and
          mindfulness to create an unbreakable mind-body connection, an
          illuminating method that shapes her life. <br /><i></i><br /><i
            >The Living Clearly Method </i
          >shows how to blend purposeful movement with conscious breath to move
          through our lives with grace, calm, and positivity. By using Hilaria’s
          five simple principles—Perspective, Breathing, Grounding, Balance, and
          Letting Go—you can flow through any situation with the beautiful union
          of mind, body, and spirit that a yoga practice can create.
          <br /><br />But learning to honor the body and listen to the soul does
          not end when you get off the mat. Hilaria believes strongly in finding
          ways to integrate the five principles into your entire life, so for
          each step she also shares her own routines that keep her active all
          the time—from the little motions that engage her body during household
          chores and the foods that keep her well nourished to the philosophy
          that grounds her when she’s being pulled in a million directions at
          once. <br /><br />This book is also packed with practical tools such
          as timesaving tips, delicious recipes inspired by clean and
          plant-based eating, mini-workouts that seamlessly integrate into your
          everyday life, breathing exercises, and customized yoga and meditation
          routines. <br /><i></i><br /><i>The Living Clearly Method </i>teaches
          you to listen to your body, tune in to your mind, and develop the
          consciousness to clear your head and find peace in your life. It is a
          beautiful, intuitive guide for living the healthiest life possible,
          both inside and out.
