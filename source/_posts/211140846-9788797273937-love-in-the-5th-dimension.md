            This book rests on the premise that we currently are in the midst of
            a huge energy-shift on Planet Earth. A shift from 3rd to 5th
            Dimension - or from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. We can
            also call it a shift from the ego's mindset to the mindset of the
            soul. This entails a paradigm-shift where we have to upgrade and
            adjust virtually everything we perceived as "normal" and "second
            nature" in the old life in 3D. We have to decide what we want to
            bring with us into the new world and what is outdated and therefore
            must be transformed or left behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most important things to look at in this process is our
            understanding of Love and the way we practice Love. Since Love is
            the essence of who we truly are and thus the foundation of
            everything in our life, we need to assess whether our Love-ability
            is in alignment with the higher vibrations i 5D. And for most us
            that isn't the case, since life in 3D was filled with a lot of
            twisted and false Love-programs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book offers insight in these outdated Love-programs alongside
            tools to transform them into higher-vibrating programs, more aligned
            with your Soul and the truth about who you really are. These tools
            are mainly based on your ability to:
          </p>
          Love yourself unconditionally as your Creator loves you.Honor your
          unique energy-signature and be true to your inner GPS.Live an
          inner-steered life where your heart/soul guides the way - replacing
          the outer-steered life based on the voice of the ego as we were taught
          in 3D.
          <p>
            As a supplement to these tools you learn how to set yourself and
            others free from the past through practicing forgiveness. This is
            important, because if the heavy energy from your life in 3D remains
            in your system, it will keep your vibrations low and making your
            ascension to 5D difficult, if not impossible. Following this you
            learn how to integrate gratitude - the ultimate shortcut to Love in
            your daily life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly you will learn how the Law of Attraction works and how to
            create love-filled circumstances and relationships by cultivating
            the Love flame in your heart. When your connection with the infinite
            source of Love is opened and nurtured - so you ARE Love - your
            vibrations will automatically rise and you will create a life that
            matches these high frequencies. Based on one of the main principles
            in The Law of Attraction: same attracts same.
          </p>
