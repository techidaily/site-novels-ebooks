            The Kitchen Witch returns in this beautifully illustrated companion
            book to Sarah Robinson's bestseller Kitchen Witch: Food, Folklore
            and Fairy Tale...including many of the traditional and seasonal
            recipes referenced in that book.

            Best-selling authors Sarah Robinson of Kitchen Witch, Yoga for
            Witches and Yin Magic and Lucy H. Pearce of Burning Woman, Creatrix
            and Medicine Woman combine forces with a diverse international coven
            of kitchen witches to share their favourite recipes, rituals and
            reflections on the magic that can be found...and made in the
            kitchen.

            This is a book to be read curled up in a comfy chair, before being
            covered in earth as you gather in seasonal goodness and splattered
            with sauce as you cook! The first half of The Kitchen Witch
            Companion is a nuanced reflection on the fantasy and reality of
            making magic in the kitchen. The second half is a seasonal
            collection of recipes and crafts, foraging and ferments, spells and
            simmer pots, meditations and blessings to inspire you to create,
            celebrate and gather throughout the Wheel of the Year.

          This is the sort of book you need to be reading in front of an open
          fire with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake. Taking your time so
          that you can truly appreciate the wonderful content. The authors have
          come together to create a beautiful book on the amazing art of Kitchen
          Witchcraft. Pull up a chair and put the kettle on, you are in for a
          real treat.<strong
            >Rachel Patterson, English Kitchen Witch and High Priestess of the
            Kitchen Witch Coven, author of over twenty-five books on witchcraft
            including Grimoire of a Kitchen Witch and the Kitchen Witchcraft
            series</strong
          >The true grail isn't found in castles guarded by knights, it was
          secretly hidden in the original place of magic, the womb of the home,
          the feminine alchemy lab, the center - the kitchen. Guarded by wise-
          women, soup-stirrers, and tea-scryers, practitioners of feminine magic
          hid their deepest secrets in pots and pans and kettles and coded their
          manuscripts in recipes. In this beautiful book, Lucy and Sarah invite
          you in for a cup of tea and bite to eat, to restore the power of the
          hearth and home where it belongs, not to fantasy housewives, but to
          rooted, generous women of magic and power, who know how to stir the
          pot in the right direction, how to feed the soul, nourish the body and
          celebrate everyday ceremony.<strong

            Awakening and Magdalene Mysteries</strong
          >If you're craving connection to the craft of cooking, The Kitchen
          Witch Companion invites you in with poetic prose, visitations to the
          cycles of life, and reveals the secrets of the seasons. It inspires.
          It invokes. It informs. And it beckons you to the reality of everyday
          magic. Even though you may never have considered yourself a Food
          Charmer, you'll certainly be imbued with the wisdom of women, past and
          present, and will step into your kitchen with a newly awakened heart.
          Practical, healing and celebratory, this gorgeous collaboration is a
          wonderful weaving of kitchen- witch wordsmithery which will accompany
          you on an enchanting journey through the alchemical abundance of
          recipes and rituals. Beautiful and brilliant.<strong

          >This newest instalment of Kitchen Witch is such a bountiful gift. A
          book for life that will be much used in my home, taking pride of place
          on an easily accessible kitchen shelf. Stuffed full of wisdom and
          magical kitchen based power shared with warmth and ease. Like an
