          An in-depth introduction to the Deva Kingdom and our relationship with
          Deva <br /><br />• Explores how we partner with Deva in our everyday
          lives to evolve both our kingdom and theirs <br /><br />• Explains the
          hierarchy of the Deva kingdom, from elementals and nature spirits to
          higher angelic Deva and every level in between <br /><br />• Offers
          suggestions on how to communicate with the Deva of trees and plants as
          well as the angelic kingdom <br /><br />• Shares the author’s personal
          experiences with Deva around the world <br /><br />Nature spirits,
          faeries, gnomes, and their higher angelic counterparts who overlight
          landscapes, mountains, rivers, and plants have held a fascination for
          people worldwide for countless generations. The Deva kingdom is
          essentially the world’s form builders, the symphony at the heart of
          Creation, yet Deva is so much more than the joyful beings that animate
          what we call Nature. We each have a very personal and direct
          relationship with Deva via our physical, astral, emotional, and mental
          elementals, but this connection has been forgotten or, at the very
          least, overlooked. When we partner with Deva in our everyday lives, we
          can help evolve both our kingdom and aspects of theirs.
          <br /><br />Exploring the realm of Deva and our relationship with
          them, Jacquelyn E. Lane introduces us to the hierarchy of the Deva
          kingdom, from elementals and nature spirits to higher Deva and the
          levels in between. She examines the metaphysics that underlie their
          existence and how the energy of Deva is intrinsic to all that we
          experience. Deva is a Sanskrit word meaning “Being of Light,” an
          appropriate name as Deva sing light out of the primordial darkness to
          create forms for Being. Sharing her personal experiences with Deva in
          many lands over four decades, the author investigates our relationship
          with Deva, in particular via the elementals of our human constitution,
          and how we can communicate with the Deva of trees and plants as well
          as the angelic kingdom. Through scientific discoveries and cultural
          traditions, we discover the impact we have on Deva and how we use and
          even “create” new forms of Deva via our inventions and collective
          activity. Jacquelyn also looks at the orchestrating function of higher
          Deva and the wider implications of our understanding of Deva,
          including the role of Deva in Pan consciousness--our increasing
          realization of the intricate matrix of life within and between all the
          kingdoms on Earth. <br /><br />Offering not only an in-depth
          introduction to the world of Deva but also a glimpse of their wisdom,
          humor, and joy, this book reveals how we can begin to hear their
          complex song, find our own song, and work with the appropriate subtle
          layers of the Deva kingdom to grow and evolve.
