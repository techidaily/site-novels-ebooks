            'He was just a pet,' people sometimes say, and yet our animal
            companions are so much more to us than this, and we may feel we have
            nowhere to turn when faced with their loss. Millions of people have
            sought answers to questions like 'What happens to animals when they
            die?' 'What is life like for them on the other side?' and 'Will they
            ever come back to me?'&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, for the first time, internationally renowned animal
            communicator Pea Horsley shares ground-breaking true stories which
            reveal animals' thoughts and feelings on life, death and life after
            death. By hearing their views, we come to understand that animals
            are spiritual beings and great teachers, and that we are all
            connected. This collection of inspirational tales is woven together
            with Pea's moving story of her own dog, Morgan, and his physical
            struggle, his awareness of the right time to go and his insights and
            support from beyond the grave.

          ‘A grounded account of real-life communications, this book puts us
          straight into the minds and hearts of the animals who speak through
          Pea. The astonishing depth and breadth of what our animals have to
          tell us is immensely touching and meaningful. An unforgettable
          read!’<br /><b>Anna Breytenbach</b>, professional interspecies
          communicator and subject of the feature documentary, The Animal
          Communicator<br /><br />‘As people face pet loss, their devastation is
          compounded by fear and guilt. With the help of her dog, Morgan, Pea
          Horsley illuminates the transition to the afterlife with true stories
          of animals who communicate when they choose to leave their physical
          bodies. This book offers hope in a time of sadness.’<br /><b
            >Allen and Linda Anderson</b
          >, founders of Angel Animals Network and authors of
          <i>Saying Goodbye to Your Angel Animals<br /></i><br />‘A book of
          deeply touching stories of the sacred and deep bond between animals
          and humans. I could feel the animals and their people almost right in
          front of me. It was very compelling!’<br /><b>Teresa Wagner</b>,
          animal communicator, Animalsinourhearts.com<br /><br />‘Once again Pea
          Horsley has brought tears to this vet’s eyes, touching me deeply with
          her astoundingly accurate and emotionally charged stories of what
          animals (and their owners) experience and gift us in the period around
          their passing out of this world. I highly recommend this book and its
          compatriot, Heart to Heart, not only to those wanting to know more
          about animal communication but to everyone who literally wants to
          experience what it is to be truly present to all our animal
          companions.’<br /><b>Tom Farringto</b>n, MVB, MRCVS, VetMFHom<br /><br />‘Readers
          who have loved and lost will feel informed and enriched after reading
          this book. Pea answers deep questions, revealing insights that will
          help hearts to heal. Be ready for an emotional journey.’<br /><b
            >Sue Parslow</b
          >, editor, <i>Your Cat</i> magazine<br /><br />‘Dealing with the death
          of your animal is hard for everyone. It helps to explore the
          possibility that your animal continues to be with you in spirit after
          death. Pea Horsley’s book helps ease the pain of losing an animal and
          opens the door to new perceptions of life and death.’<br /><b

          <i>My Animal, My Self, Learning Their Language, Ask Your Animal </i
          >and <i>Beyond Words</i><br /><br />&nbsp;<br />‘After reading about
          Pea’s experiences and the messages from animals during and after their
          transition from this life, you will understand more about how they
          feel, which will help to ease your grief and bring acceptance, peace,
          and eternal communion.’<br /><b>Penelope Smith</b>, founding animal
          communication specialist, author of
          <i>Animal Talk, When Animals Speak </i>and <i>Animals in Spirit</i
          ><br /><br />‘When I was asked to read these true-life stories from
          Pea Horsley, I wasn’t prepared for the emotional and inspirational
          content of the tales. I was moved and intrigued by the warmth, honesty
          and love that came through on the page. I would recommend this book,
          sensitively written and from the heart, to anyone who wants to know
          about the work of an animal communicator and for those who seek
          comfort and insight from those who have passed before us.’<br /><b
            >Avril Price</b
          >, senior tutor and consultant, the College of Psychic Studies<br /><br />‘This
          is a must-read book for all those who love their animals and wish to
          approach their animals’ end-times with great compassion,
          understanding, and sensitivity. You will laugh and you will cry, and
          you will come to a place of absolute knowing regarding the oneness of
          all life and that love is eternal.’<br /><b>Elizabeth Severino</b>,
          DRS, animal communicator and spiritual healer, author of
          <i>The Animals’ Viewpoint on Dying, Death and Euthanasia</i
          ><br /><br />‘Pea takes a fresh look at pet loss from an entirely new
          perspective, one that offers the hope and comfort that owners are
          seeking. The touching and inspiring stories in her book signify that
          death is not the end, but rather the start of a new journey. Pea’s
          book will give owners an important insight into animal communication
          and ultimately bring them closer to their animals.’<br /><b

          (APPCC.org.uk) and a partner at the award-winning Dignity pet
          crematorium in Hampshire<br /><br />‘Pea Horsley, animal communicator,
          gifted writer and friend, is possessed of an acute awareness, love and
          understanding of the animals with whom we share our living space. In
          this, her second book, Pea continues to inspire us with her boundless
          compassion for our animal companions during life and in death.’<br /><b
