            >#1 <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER<br /><br />“Anne Lamott is my
            Oprah.” —<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br /><br />From the bestselling
            author of <i>Dusk, Night, Dawn </i>and <i>Help, Thanks, Wow</i>, a
            joyful celebration of love</b
          ><br /><br />“Love is our only hope,” Anne Lamott writes in this
          perceptive new book. “It is not always the easiest choice, but it is
          always the right one, the noble path, the way home to safety, no
          matter how bleak the future looks.”<br /><br />In
          <i>Somehow: Thoughts on Love</i>, Lamott explores the transformative
          power that love has in our lives: how it surprises us, forces us to
          confront uncomfortable truths, reminds us of our humanity, and guides
          us forward. “Love just won't be pinned down,” she says. “It is in our
          very atmosphere” and lies at the heart of who we are. We are, Lamott
          says, creatures of love.<br /><br />In each chapter of
          <i>Somehow</i>,&nbsp;Lamott refracts all the colors of the spectrum.
          She explores the unexpected love for a partner later in life. The
          bruised (and bruising) love for a child who disappoints, even
          frightens. The sustaining love among a group of sinners, for a
          community in transition, in the wider world. The lessons she
          underscores are that love enlightens as it educates, comforts as it
          energizes, sustains as it surprises.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>Somehow </i
          >is Anne Lamott’s&nbsp;twentieth book, and in it she draws from her
          own life and experience to delineate the intimate and elemental ways
          that love buttresses us in the face of despair as it galvanizes us to
          believe that tomorrow will be better than today. Full of the
          compassion and humanity that have made Lamott beloved by millions of
          readers, <i>Somehow </i>is classic Anne Lamott: funny, warm, and wise.

          <b>PRAISE FOR <i>SOMEHOW: Thoughts on Love </i> </b><br />
          <b> </b><br />
          “Lamott brings her signature wit and warmth to these effervescent
          meditations on matters of the heart. . . . A topic that might feel
          trite in the hands of a lesser writer takes on fresh meaning in
          Lamott’s, thanks to her ability to distill complex truths with a
          deceptive lightness. This rings true.”&nbsp;—<b
            >Publishers Weekly (starred review)</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Lamott senses love in myriad ways. . . . Her innate honesty allows
          her to share her vulnerabilities and laugh at her own sometimes
          over-the-top attempts to find and share love.&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;But it
          is all done with such clarity, feeling, and goodness that readers will
          find themselves laughing out loud and fighting back tears. Ultimately,
          this is a testimony to love and hope in an often painful world.
          Lamott’s many readers are loyal, and this will be an easy sell. But
          pass it on, too, to people who may not even realize that they are
          searching for ways to connect with and love others.” —<b
            >Booklist (starred review)<br /></b
          ><br />
          “In this book, [Lamott] focuses less on vengeful thinking for comic
          effect and more on the joys of smelling the roses.&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;As
          always, a strong vein of spirituality runs throughout, with Lamott’s
          characteristic descriptions of an all-loving God who is often
          flummoxed and saddened by humanity, but hopeful anyway.&nbsp;. .
          .&nbsp;[This] is a kind view of loving oneself and others despite our
          collective imperfections.” —<b>Kirkus</b>
