            No one is ever so far gone into a life of sin that God cannot redeem
            them. Likewise, no one is ever so intimate with God that there isn't
            room for more intimacy. There is always more!Communion and union
            with Christ is what we were born for, yet we convince ourselves that
            we can only get to a certain level of intimacy and that's it. These
            higher levels of communion with God are set aside for other people,
            you know those real pious ones or just pastors or just...That is the
            lie we believe. We as believers are disciples of Jesus. As
            disciples, we are to imitate Jesus. Jesus demonstrated what it
            looked like as a man to walk in constant communion with the Father.
            This means that it is available to us, all of us, no matter who you
            are. God wants to draw near to us, but we need to do our part and
            draw near to Him. This book demonstrates how faithful God is.
            Intimacy with God, deep intimacy, is available to everyone. At
            first, it may seem difficult or even impossible, but the truth is
            that it is a tactic of the enemy to convince us that we cannot have
            what God died to give us; that is relationship and constant
            communion and union with Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and God the
            Father. It is all available to us. It is a treasure that has been
            given to us through salvation that is to be fully utilized in this
            lifetime.The intent of this book is to bring many into the kingdom
            as well as leading those that are already in Christ into a deeper,
            more meaningful, intimate relationship with Christ. This book
            documents a forty-day journey to achieving intimacy with God, taking
            every thought captive and submitting to God. It has been to date the
            most powerful forty days of my life. The outcome of this experiment
            has changed my life and it will change yours too.If you have been
            seeking a more intimate relationship with the God head or if you
            have been thinking of committing your life to Christ but are just
            not sure, then this is the book for you.
