              miserable. Two years later, as a senior, I enjoyed the most
              satisfying basketball season of my life. My path from depression
              and anxiety to joy and peak performance was somewhat
              unconventional. A therapist taught me to meditate, enabling me to
              face my problems instead of shrinking from them. By modifying my
              habits regarding drugs, partying and my phone, and reading
              meaningful books, I developed new attitudes toward both my sport
              and my life.&nbsp;</span
