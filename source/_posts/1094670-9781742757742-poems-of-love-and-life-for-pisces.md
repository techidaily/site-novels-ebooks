            >Pisceans, ever wondered what the Sun-signs tell you about love and
            life?</b
          ><br /><b></b><br /><b></b>This unique anthology of poems for love and
          life relates directly to your Sun-sign, Pisces. If you were born
          between the 19th of February and the 20th of March, you will relate to
          many of the themes identified with your sign’s characteristics and
          personality traits. The poems in this collection have been chosen
          because they reflect a Piscean attitude to life. They appeal to the
          interests ‘ruled’ by your sign; the animals, flowers, trees, plants
          and places celebrated by the poets and associated with the sign of
          Pisces over three thousand years of traditional astrology. Some have
          been chosen simply because we believe you will enjoy them, and that
          they will awaken or re-awaken your love of poetry.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Heralding from England, Derek and Julia Parker were married at 25
          years of age. Since then, Derek and Julia have become the world’s most
          knowledgeable couple on all things astrology. Their expertise has seen
          them travel the globe and produce countless works on a range of topics
          from the arts, life, love and the messages of the universe.
          <br /><br />In 1965, Julia studied for the Diploma of the Faculty of
          Astrological Studies. After completing her studies, Julia went on to
          become the faculty’s secretary, progressing to president and finally
          one of its three Patrons. Julia has written the horoscope column for
          <i>Cosmopolitan</i> and <i>Good Housekeeping</i> (UK) as well as the
          <i>Hong Kong Tatler</i>. Her books include <i>Hearts of Fire </i>and
          <i>The Stars Shine Bright.</i><br /><br />Derek’s career began in
          radio but has spread to numerous written works on dance, opera,
          literature and astrology including biographies of Nell Gwyn and
          Casanova. He has reviewed books for <i>The Times</i> and edited
          <i>The Poetry Review.</i><br /><br />Together they have produced a
          long list of titles including <i>The New Compleat Astrologer</i>,
          <i>Dreaming, and The Complete Book of Dreams.</i> Furthermore, Derek
          and Julia’s <i>Parker’s Astrology</i>, published in 2001, is regarded
          as the world’s best introduction to astrology, for beginners.
          <br /><br />After lecturing all around the world including the UK, USA
          and New Zealand, Derek and Julia now call Sydney home.
          <i>Poems of Life and Love</i> is their latest adventure.
