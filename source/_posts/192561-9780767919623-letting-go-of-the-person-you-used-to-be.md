          The beloved American Lama, a spiritual leader whose inimitable light
          and<br />lively universal teaching style has awakened the spirituality
          of thousands, now shares an enlightened approach to change and loss,
          dealing with difficult emotions such as fear, grief, and anger, and
          the role of crisis in uncovering our authentic selves.<br /><br />For
          many people, recent years have been characterized by profound change,
          whether it relates to financial upheaval, political shifts, or even
          massive losses of life to disease and violence. Even on the personal
          level each person must confront the curves life throws his or her way.
          Buddhism has a great deal to say about change and impermanence and how
          to meaningfully deal with it. Change--whether on a large or small
          scale--provides our most important opportunity for learning about
          ourselves and the nature of reality. From this essential insight Lama
          Surya Das has crafted a fulfilling and important path to understanding
          and healing ourselves and finding peace.<br /><br />Full of personal
          stories, anecdotes, practical exercises, guided meditations and
          reflections, and pithy original aphorisms,
          <i>Letting Go of the Person You Used to Be</i> addresses life's most
          universal difficulties in a way that is accessible to all. By using
          memorable concepts such as The Virtues of Adversity, The Pearl
          Principle ("No inner irritation, no pearl"), and Gaining through Loss,
          Surya reminds readers that hiding from change and loss is futile.
          Learning to consciously accept and embrace change leads to a better
          understanding of ourselves and our own innate divine light.

          Praise for the landmark Awakening Trilogy by Lama Surya Das<br /><br /><i
            >Awakening the Buddha Within<br /></i
          ><br />“Lama Surya Das communicates the wisdom of Buddhism to the
          people of his times and environments. To me this is a great
          achievement and I feel deeply grateful for it.” –Thich Nhat Hanh,
          author of <i>Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames</i><br /><br />“This
          open-hearted offering of the Buddha’s teachings ranges from the
          fundamentals to magic. It is a wonderful gift.” --Sharon Salzberg,
          author of <i>Faith: Trusting Our Own Deepest Experience<br /></i
          ><br />“Wise and wonderful, gentle and profound.…This is surely one of
          the finest spiritual manuals meant for a larger public and it succeeds
          brilliantly.” --Ken Wilbur, author of
          <i>A Brief History of Everything</i><br /><br /><i
            >Awakening to the Sacred<br /></i
          ><br />“<i>Awakening to the Sacred</i> will bring great gifts into the
          lives of its readers. It is user-friendly—filled with beautiful
          teachings, gracious stories, dozens of practices, humorous takes and
          wise practical ways to invite our hearts to awaken to the highest
          wisdom in every part of our lives.” --Jack Kornfield, author of
          <i>A Path with Heart</i><br /><br />“Lama Surya Das offers a fresh and
          invigorating approach to the perennial quest which gives natural
          spirituality its rightful place at the center of things.” --Mitchell
          Kapor, founder of the Lotus Foundation<br /><br />“<i

          ><br />“In <i>Awakening the Buddhist Heart</i>, Lama Surya Das brings
          the depth of wisdom and understanding to the realities of our everyday
          life. This is a helpful guide for all those walking the path to
          awakening while living in the world.” --Joseph Goldstein, author of
          <i>Insight Meditation</i><br /><br />“When we come to the end of our
          lives, what will matter most are the relationships we’ve shared with
          loved ones. <i>Awakening the Buddhist Heart</i> takes you on a
          spiritual journey that will return you to this important priority.”
          --Cheryl Richardson, author of <i>Take Time for Your Life<br /></i
          ><br />"Lama Surya Das makes the Buddha nature seem very real and
          accessible. I feel lighter, I feel calmer, I feel more peaceful. This
          book is a blessing on my bookshelf and a blessing on my heart."
          --Marianne Williamson, author of <i>A Return to Love</i>
