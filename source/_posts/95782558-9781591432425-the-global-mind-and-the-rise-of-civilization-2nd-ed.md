          How the global mind drives the evolution of both consciousness and
          civilization<br /><br />• Explains how our brains receive
          consciousness from the global mind, which upgrades human consciousness
          according to a pre-set divine time frame<br /><br />• Reveals how the
          Mayan Calendar provides a blueprint for these consciousness downloads
          throughout history<br /><br />• Examines the mind shift in humans and
          the development of pyramids and civilization in ancient Egypt, Sumer,
          South America, and Asia beginning in 3115 BCE<br /><br />In each
          culture the origins of civilization can be tied to the arising of one
          concept in the human mind: straight lines. Straight and perpendicular
          lines are not found in nature, so where did they come from? What shift
          in consciousness occurred around the globe that triggered the start of
          rectangular building methods and linear organization as well as
          written language, pyramid construction, mathematics, and art?<br /><br />Offering
          a detailed answer to this question, Carl Calleman explores the quantum
          evolution of the global mind and its holographic resonance with the
          human mind. He examines how our brains are not thinking machines but
          individual receivers of consciousness from the global mind, which
          creates holographic downloads to adjust human consciousness to new
          cosmological circumstances. He explains how the Mayan Calendar
          provides a blueprint for these downloads throughout history and how
          the global mind, rather than the individual, has the power to make
          civilizations rise and fall. He shows how, at the beginning of the
          Mayan 6th Wave (Long Count) in 3115 BCE, the global mind gave human
          beings the capacity to conceptualize spatial relations in terms of
          straight and perpendicular lines, initiating the building of pyramids
          and megaliths around the world and leading to the rise of modern
          civilization. He examines the symbolism within the Great Pyramid of
          Giza and the pyramid at Chichén Itzá and looks at the differences
          between humans of the 6th Wave in ancient Egypt, Sumer, South America,
          and Asia and the cave painters of the 5th Wave. He reveals how the
          global mind is always connected to the inner core of the Earth and
          discusses how the two halves of the brain parallel the civilizations
          of the East and West.<br /><br />Outlining the historical,
          psychological, geophysical, and neurological roots of the modern human
          mind, Calleman shows how studying early civilizations offers a means
          of understanding the evolution of consciousness.

          “<i>The Global Mind and the Rise of Civilization</i> addresses one of
          the crucial issues of our time, on which our future may depend: the
          relationship between human consciousness and the brain. The evidence
          shows that mind and brain are not identical, as we have been led to
          believe. Minds are capable of things that brains cannot do. The
          implication--that we are more than our physical brains and
          bodies--will likely be regarded as the most important discovery of our
          era. Let Calleman be your guide on this exciting journey.”
