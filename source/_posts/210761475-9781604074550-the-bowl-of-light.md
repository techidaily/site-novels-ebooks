          <p>
            In 1996, a revered Hawaiian elder befriended an American
            anthropologist, and from their rare and intimate rapport, something
            miraculous emerged. Through the words and teachings of the kahuna
            wisdom-keeper Hale Makua, Dr. Hank Wesselman was gifted with an
            enhanced perspective into the sacred knowledge of ancient Hawaii.<br />Before
            his passing, elder Makua encouraged Dr. Wesselman to convey much of
            what had passed between them to the wider world, giving him
            permission to share his spiritual knowledge. Now, with The Bowl of
            Light, you are invited to share in the sacred wisdom of one of the
            world's most powerful indigenous traditions, including:<br />The
            Bowl of Light—how we can restore our natural divine radianceThe
            three directives of the spiritual warrior—love with humility, live
            with reverence, and know with self-disciplineRituals for communing
            with nature, receiving wisdom from the spirit world, purifying our
            consciousness, and moreThe Ancestral Grand Plan—exploring the path
            our ancestors set in motion millennia ago, and how the Plan is
            playing out across the world today
