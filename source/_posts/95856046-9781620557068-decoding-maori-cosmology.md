          An exploration of New Zealand’s Maori cosmology and how it relates to
          classic ancient symbolic traditions around the world <br /><br />•
          Shows how Maori myths, symbols, cosmological concepts, and words
          reflect symbolic elements found at Göbekli Tepe in Turkey
          <br /><br />• Demonstrates parallels between the Maori cosmological
          tradition and those of ancient Egypt, China, India, Scotland, and the
          Dogon of Mali in Africa <br /><br />• Explores the pygmy tradition
          associated with Maori cosmology, which shares elements of the Little
          People mythology of Ireland, including matching mound structures and
          common folk traditions <br /><br />It is generally accepted that the
          Maori people arrived in New Zealand quite recently, sometime after
          1200 AD. However, new evidence suggests that their culture is most
          likely centuries older with roots that can be traced back to the
          archaic Göbekli Tepe site in Turkey, built around 10,000 BC.
          <br />Extending his global cosmology comparisons to New Zealand, Laird
          Scranton shows how the same cosmological concepts and linguistic roots
          that began at Göbekli Tepe are also evident in Maori culture and
          language. These are the same elements that underlie Dogon, ancient
          Egyptian, and ancient Chinese cosmologies as well as the Sakti Cult of
          India (a precursor to Vedic, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions) and the
          Neolithic culture of Orkney Island in northern Scotland. While the
          cultural and linguistic roots of the Maori are distinctly Polynesian,
          the author shows how the cosmology in New Zealand was sheltered from
          outside influences and likely reflects ancient sources better than
          other Polynesian cultures. In addition to shared creation concepts, he
          details a multitude of strikingly similar word pronunciations and
          meanings, shared by Maori language and the Dogon and Egyptian
          languages, as well as likely connections to various Biblical terms and
          traditions. He discusses the Maori use of standing stones to denote
          spiritual spaces and sanctuaries and how their esoteric mystery
          schools are housed in structures architecturally similar to those
          commonly found in Ireland. He discusses the symbolism of the Seven
          Mythic Canoes of the Maori and uncovers symbolic aspects of the
          elephant-headed Hindu god Ganesha in Maori cosmology. <br /><br />The
          author also explores the outwardly similar pygmy traditions of Ireland
          and New Zealand, characterized by matching fairy mound constructions
          and mythic references in both regions. He reveals how the trail of a
          group of Little People who vanished from Orkney Island in ancient
          times might be traced first to Scotland, Ireland, and England and then
          on to New Zealand, accompanied by signature elements of the global
          cosmology first seen at Gobekli Tepe.

          “With every book Laird Scranton writes, he take us deeper into
          understanding our origin and ourselves. Using his solid foundation of
          Dogon, Egyptian, Chinese, and Scottish cultures he again displays to
          the reader the complexities inherent in ancient civilizations and
          provides additional insights into our obscured past. Laird continues
          to broaden our understanding of the advanced technical concepts that
          are fundamental to world myths, concepts so advanced that we are only
          rediscovering many of them today. He suggests that there is an archaic
          connection between these diverse cultures, with the ancient cosmology
          of the Maori of New Zealand further validating this interconnected web
          of language, culture, science, and tradition.
          <i>Decoding Maori Cosmology</i> presents intriguing correlations and
          compelling arguments that cause you to stop and think.”
