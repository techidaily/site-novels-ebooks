          • Explains how the Greys are bio-machines, synthetic beings sent out
          to gather information about human souls and natural consciousness
          <br /><br />• Shows how our consciousness has been hacked by the Greys
          to filter our perceptions to be in line with their agenda to steal our
          souls <br /><br />• Reveals how you can protect your soul field and
          your consciousness from the Greys’ terrible manipulations
          <br /><br />Humanity’s biggest existential threat is our headlong rush
          to a technologically advanced future. Already we increasingly rely on
          smart devices to the point that they are becoming extensions of our
          bodies. We are at a turning point for our species in which our natural
          humanity is gradually being converted into an artificial format that
          will lead to the loss of our souls. And, as Nigel Kerner reveals in
          astonishing detail, the blueprints for this future already exist.
          <br /><br />Kerner explains how there are civilizations in our
          universe that have developed advanced technologies to become entirely
          artificial. The Grey alien entities, reported in tens of thousands of
          abductions, appear to be biomachines, synthetic beings sent out as AI
          probes to gather information about something they lack that humans and
          other natural beings possess: a soul. Examining scientific,
          historical, cultural, and religious evidence for Grey alien
          visitations as far back as 40,000 years ago, the author reveals that
          the Greys themselves set us on this path toward artificial
          intelligence millennia ago. Kerner shows how our intrinsic nature as
          human beings is no longer entirely human: our natural consciousness
          and DNA have been hacked, and an artificial construct has been
          superimposed at the very foundation of our thinking processes. The
          author shows how our rush toward a technologically advanced,
          artificially intelligent future was seeded and precipitated by the
          Greys in order to control us and prepare us to fit in with their
          agenda for humanity. <br /><br />Revealing the secret alien hives on
          our planet, their connections to governments, and their ultimate
          endgame to harvest our souls and alter our DNA, Kerner also shows how,
          by developing yourself on a soul level, by recognizing your individual
          connection to divinity, you can protect your soul field and your
          consciousness from the Greys’ terrible manipulations.

          “As Earth’s human technologies in the twenty-first century move
          rapidly to dependence on robotic artificial intelligence, Nigel Kerner
          warns that Grey nonhumans that interact with our planet are actually
          cloned artificial intelligence that want our organic human souls. Will
          organic versus inorganic intelligence be the cosmic battle of 2100?”
