            College is a time of transition. It’s a time for learning and
            preparing to make your own way in the world. But if you’re like many
            teens and young adults, the thought of leaving home and being on
            your own in a new place can also be intimidating—even overwhelming.
            That’s why you need a solid foundation to help you manage stress,
            stay focused, and maintain healthy habits—in body, mind, and spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grounded in evidence-based mindfulness,
            <i>The Mindful College Student</i> will help you cultivate the
            cognitive and emotional skills you need to increase well-being and
            reach your highest aspirations. You’ll also learn positive coping
            strategies for dealing with stress, sadness, and anxiety—including
            diet, fitness, and sleep habits. Most importantly, you’ll discover
            three core self-regulation skills to help steer you toward the life
            you want: self-awareness, attention control, and emotion regulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Get ready to take on the world with this fun and informative guide,
            filled with everything you need to face all of the challenges of
            college life—and beyond!
