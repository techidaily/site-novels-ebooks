          “No other researcher has been able to transmit to the rest of us the
          true meaning and impact of near-death phenomena for the planet.”<br />
          —Bruce Greyson, MD, bestselling author of <i>After</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “A major contribution that offers a wealth of case materials together
          with balanced and insightful commentary.”<br />
          —Raymond A. Moody, PhD, bestselling author of <i>Life After Life</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          While providing many remarkable accounts of near-death experiences
          (NDEs), <i>Lessons from the </i>Light is much more than an inspiring
          collection of NDEs. In clear language, the practical lessons for
          living and dying are to be found from the study of these experiences.
          Written by one of the foremost authorities on NDEs,<i>
            Lessons from the Light</i
          >
          is a book for those looking to gain knowledge and wisdom to enhance
          their own lives by incorporating the insights stemming from what many
          people have come to believe is the ultimate spiritual experience.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Although <i>Lessons from the Light</i> recounts many moving stories of
          NDEs, it is not just another book filled with inspiring testimonies—it
          includes helpful guidance and practical exercises concerning how
          readers can make use of this knowledge to live with greater
          self-insight, self-compassion and concern for others, as well as be
          better prepared for death, dying, and bereavement. Readers can easily
          apply what they have learned to their own lives and absorb and
          internalize these lessons from the Light in such a way as to lead to
          deep personal and spiritual transformation.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This edition replaces the previous edition (ISBN 978-1-930491-11-3)
          and contains a new postscript by the author.
