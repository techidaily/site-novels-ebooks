            While in training at the C.G. Jung Institute in Zürich in 1988,
            Susan Olson suffered the loss of her daughter in an auto accident.
            In this intimate and unique exploration, Olson uses C. G. Jung’s
            psychological framework to<i></i>describe her journey through
            tragedy, guided by a series of vivid dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            In
            <i>Images of the Dead in Grief Dreams: A Jungian View of Mourning</i
            >, Jung's definition of the dream as a "harbinger of fate, a portent
            and comforter, a messenger of the gods" evolves from theory into
            embodied insight as Olson describes her encounter with the
            transforming power of grief. Drawing from personal experience as
            well as theoretical and clinical material, Olson presents
            premonitory dreams, which occur before the loss of a loved one, and
            grief dreams, which follow a loved one’s death, and analyzes both
            according to Jung’s method of dream interpretation. Sharing her own
            dreams as well as those of other mourners, Olson asserts that such
            dreams play a crucial role in the dreamer’s emotional recovery and
            psychological development, otherwise known as the process of
            individuation. She sensitively offers an assessment of the stages of
            grief and draws on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, Jung’s
            memoirs, and other literature to amplify her experience of mourning.
            In this rare combination of grief theory and dream work,
            <i>Images of the Dead in Grief Dreams </i>is both a grief memoir and
            an extensive study of C. G. Jung’s view of the mourning process.
          </p>
          <p>
            This fully updated revised edition will be of immense interest to
            Jungian analysts and trainees, academics, psychologists, students of
            Jungian dream analysis, and to all who have suffered loss.

          "C. G. Jung characterized his psychology and as an attempt, 'ever
          renewed, to give an answer to the question of the interplay between
          "here" and "hereafter".' Inspired by her own bereavement, Susan Olson
          soulfully engages the same interplay. Grappling now with the starkness
          of loss, now with the richness of death, she gives her answer to the
          'here' and 'hereafter' question. A book of love and mystery. Highly
          recommended!" — Greg Mogenson, Jungian analyst, author of
          <i>Greeting the Angels: An Imaginal View of the Mourning Process</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "A truly psychological work. Grounded in personal experiences, and
          armed with wide-ranging knowledge and sensitivity, the author explores
          grief, transformation, and dreams of the dead in human psychology.
          This remarkable book can help us, professionally and personally, face
          the loss of a loved one and the legacy for the dead." — Paul Kugler,
          Jungian analyst, author of
          <i>Raids on the Unthinkable: Freudian and Jungian Psychoanalysis</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Susan Olson follows the unconscious currents that shape and channel
          mourning. Her book is a generous, deeply moving, and personal gift to
          all whose hearts will never be unbroken after the loss of a child.
          Hearts may mend through a journey in the symbolic landscapes of
          dreams, where the beloved one lives on in a form scarcely recognized
          by our limited consciousness." — Kathrin Asper, Jungian analyst,
          author of <i>The Inner Child in Dreams</i>
