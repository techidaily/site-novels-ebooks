          In this innovative contribution to the field of energy medicine,
          experienced mycologist and herbalist Robert Rogers offers an extensive
          guide to healing a range of physical, emotional, and psychological
          conditions with mushroom essences. Similar to flower essences, but
          made under a lunar cycle, mushroom essences work subtly to bring deep
          healing to the mind and body; they are particularly well suited for
          working with the “shadow” or unintegrated parts of the psyche. The
          book is organized as an easy-to-use alphabetical reference, with
          entries that outline how to create each essence, indications for
          usage, and healing effects. Along the way, Rogers provides enlivening
          stories of his personal experience using these remedies in clinical
          practice. A profound exploration of both the practical and mythopoetic
          qualities of the mushroom, this is a must-have for anyone interested
          in plant medicine, mycology, personal healing, or depth psychology.

        </h4>
        <p>
          "Mushrooms emerge from beneath the forest soil and from the trunks of
          old and dead trees—their mycelia decompose organic wastes and bring
          forth fruiting bodies that can heal us, nourish us, or transform our
          consciousness. In this beautiful book, Robert Dale Rogers outlines the
          ways in which the vibrational medicine of mushrooms can do the same
          thing for the human spirit—metabolizing what we hide in the shadows
          and helping us to bring forth the fruit of our own unique
          essences.&nbsp;Drawing on Rogers’s decades of experience as an
          herbalist and his encyclopedic knowledge of alchemy, flower essences,
          and &nbsp;fungal ecology and pharmacology,&nbsp;Mushroom
          Essences&nbsp;is simultaneously infused with magic and eminently
          practical: a comprehensive guide to a new form of medicine."—Sean
          Donahue, traditional herbalist and faculty member, Pacific Rim
          College<br /><br />"I love this book. It is simple, easy to read, and
          user friendly, with case studies to illustrate the potential impact of
          each mushroom essence and a a ready-to-use repertory. Robert Rogers
          provides an astute explanation of how each of us not only has a dark
          side or shadow side but must embrace it, not only for our own healing
          but for the healing of our planet."—Sabina Pettitt, Dr. TCM, cocreator
          of Pacific Essences®&nbsp;<br /><br />"In&nbsp;<i
            >Mushroom Essences,</i
          >&nbsp;Robert Rogers points out how mushroom essences help us work
          with our shadow side and deal with the depths of human suffering and
          despair—something we must come to grips with on a worldwide level.
          This book is a must-read in order for us, as humans, to take up our
          rightful place within nature as true stewards instead of mere shadows
          of this honored position."—Pam Montgomery, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Partner Earth: A Spiritual Ecology</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i
            >Plant Spirit Healing: A Guide to Working with Plant
            Consciousness</i
          ><br /><br />"Charting new territory and going where no one else has
          gone before always takes special courage and oversight. Within the
          realm of vibrational preparations, mushrooms and lichens have hitherto
          been almost entirely ignored. With his remarkable research, Robert
          Rogers gifts us with unprecedented insight into a neglected corner of
          energy medicine. Rogers presents several novel ways of essence
          preparation, showing his deep and sensitive communion with nature.
          Detailing the indications and uses of forty-eight new essences backed
          up with case histories, he poetically weaves together this must-read
          source of mushroom wisdom."—Julia Graves, author of&nbsp;<i
            >The Language of Plants</i
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />"If we are to reach our fullest potential,
          we must learn about and integrate the&nbsp;shadow. As difficult as
          this journey can be, we have been provided the means to be supported
          throughout it: the fungi. Robert Rogers’s work with their intelligence
          in the form of “essences” to augment this challenging journey is a
          poignant eye-opener—one many of us may not be ready for, but one we
          dearly need. <i>Mushroom Essences</i>&nbsp;provides a valuable toolkit
          for anyone on the herbal path towards psychospiritual health."—James
          W. Jesso, author of&nbsp;<i>True Light Of Darkness</i
          ><br /><br />"Soul connection, transformation, healing the traumatized
          psyche—these are the purview of mushroom essences. They transmute the
          dark elements of our injured minds and spirits to experiences and
          expressions of the authentic, joyous life that is our birthright. They
          speak healing truths to the body, mind, and spirit without harm or
          pain. In&nbsp;<i>Mushroom Essences </i>Robert Rogers gives us clear
          knowledge, means, and methods for personal freedom and
          wholeness."—Sandra Dutreau Williams, PhD, founder and director of
          Mushrooms for Well Being Foundation
