          This is the surprising story of a businessman’s unexpected leap into
          “Simple Awakening.”<br /><br />Michael Linenberger is a relatively
          normal businessman who for decades managed technology and consulting
          projects for some of the largest companies in the world. But starting
          in late 2012, Michael discovered a deep and profound inner silence
          entering his life that grew stronger and stronger each day. From that
          silence, a fundamental set of life transformations emerged:
          <br /><br />• Work became easy; life became easy; all striving ceased.
          <br /><br />• All fears and doubts disappeared. <br /><br />•
          Unconditional happiness—bliss—moved in. <br /><br />Perhaps most
          important, a profound and accurate intuition took residence that began
          guiding his life to greater and greater achievements, both in his
          business and personal life. All these changes occurred through
          something Michael calls simple awakening—which he feels everyone has
          the potential to achieve.<br /><br />In an extraordinarily practical
          way, Michael tells the story of how, step by step, this amazing
          transformation unfolded over three years. Most important, he explains
          what awakening can mean to you: what it looks like, how you might
          cultivate it, and the many ways it could revolutionize your entire
          life.

          Michael’s book is so needed! It's very inspirational because it shows
          that awakening is achievable. It gives people hope that they can
          actually get to that place of expanded consciousness.
