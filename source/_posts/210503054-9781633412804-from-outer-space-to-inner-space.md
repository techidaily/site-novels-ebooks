              >The sixth man who walked on the moon shares his journey to the

            ><br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In February 1971, as Apollo 14 astronaut Edgar Mitchell hurtled
            Earthward through space, he was engulfed by a profound sense of
            universal connectedness. He intuitively sensed that his presence and
            that of the planet in the window were all part of a deliberate,
            universal process, and that the glittering cosmos itself was, in
            some way, conscious. The experience was so overwhelming, Mitchell
            knew his life would never be the same. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            For the next thirty-five years, he embarked on another journey, an
            inward exploration of the ineffable mystery of human consciousness
            and being. Mitchell left NASA to form the Institute of Noetic
            Sciences (IONS). There he initiated research in areas of study
            previously neglected by mainstream science and constructed a theory
            that could explain not only the mysteries of consciousness, but also
            the psychic event—what spiritualists call a “miracle” and scientists
            dismiss altogether. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Mitchell also created a new dyadic model of reality, revealing a
            self-aware universe not predetermined by the laws of physics,
            preordained by deities, or infinitely malleable. While human actions
            are generally subject to the laws of physics, these laws are also
            influenced by the mind. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b><i>From Outer Space to Inner Space</i></b> traces two remarkable
            journeys—one through space and one through the mind. Together they
            fundamentally alter the way we understand the miracle and mystery of
            being, and ultimately reveal humankind’s role in its own destiny.
