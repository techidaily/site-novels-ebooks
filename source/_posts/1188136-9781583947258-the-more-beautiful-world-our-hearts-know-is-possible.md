            >A beacon of hope in the face of our current world crises, this
            uplifting book demonstrates how embracing our interconnectedness is
            key to world transformation</b
          ><br /><br />
          In a time of social and ecological crisis, what can we as individuals
          do to make the world a better place? This inspirational and
          thought-provoking book serves as an empowering antidote to the
          cynicism, frustration, paralysis, and overwhelm so many of us are
          feeling, replacing it with a grounding reminder of what’s true: we are
          all connected, and our small, personal choices bear unsuspected
          transformational power. By fully embracing and practicing this
          principle of interconnectedness—called interbeing—we become more
          effective agents of change and have a stronger positive influence on
          the world.<br /><br />
          Throughout the book, Eisenstein relates real-life stories showing how
          small, individual acts of courage, kindness, and self-trust can change
          our culture’s guiding narrative of separation, which, he shows, has
          generated the present planetary crisis. He brings to conscious
          awareness a deep wisdom we all innately know: until we get ourselves
          in order, any action we take—no matter how good our intentions—will
          ultimately be wrong-headed and wrong-hearted. Above all, Eisenstein
          invites us to embrace a radically different understanding of cause and
          effect, sounding a clarion call to surrender our old worldview of
          separation, so that we can finally create the more beautiful world our
          hearts know is possible.<br /><br />
          With chapters covering separation, interbeing, despair, hope, pain,
          pleasure, consciousness, and many more, the book invites us to let the
          old Story of Separation fall away so that we can stand firmly in a
          Story of Interbeing.

          "This is a revolutionary and interactive book—in the sense that it
          inspires the reader to think out of the ordinary. Eisenstein will be
          noted in antiquity as one of the seminal and pioneering storytellers
          of this new world."<br /><b

          a feast for mind and heart." &nbsp; <br /><b

          “When I read Charles Eisenstein I felt as if I had just put on an
          extraordinarily clear, lucid, morally honest set of glasses. I see my
          outer and inner worlds in penetrating detail. He isn't just describing
          a possible world. He is helping us find our way to it.”&nbsp; <br /><b
            >—Vicki Robin, author of <i>Your Money or Your Life</i></b

          <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Charles Eisenstein is a cultural investigative journalist,
          questioning the perpetually unexamined assumptions of both
          conventional and counter-cultural thinking. He is a cultural
          storyteller, a visionary who gives us a glimpse of what the new Story
          of the People may look like, how we might get there, and how close we
          are to it.”<br /><b
            >—Mark Boyle, author of <i>The Moneyless Manifesto</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />“God damn this is good! This version of the big story by
          Charles Eisenstein is one of the best I have ever heard. Charles, you
          are speaking for millions of us and we so know what you are saying to
          be true. We will absolutely tell the whole fucking world about it.”<br /><b

          &nbsp;<br />
          “The more beautiful world I inhabit accords with Charles Eisenstein's
          vision: a world where we embrace the shadow and give it name so that
          the healing can begin. Take this book and let it seep into your very
          being.”<br /><b

          &nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;“This book will change your world. It is beautiful because
          Charles Eisenstein has the courage to be vulnerable and it is in
          acknowledging our vulnerability that we will realize our greater
          humanity.”<br /><b
            >—Revd Peter Owen-Jones, presenter of
            <i>Around the World in 80 Faiths</i>, author, and priest</b
          ><br /><br />"One does not 'read' this book, but rather interacts with
          it. And take heed, it will open your heart and mind, arouse ire and
          derision, and change the way you think about your life. Beautifully
          written, heart-warming, and thought-provoking, Eisenstein will
          undoubtedly be noted in history as a pivotal storyteller."<br /><b

          ><br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Sacred Economics</i></b> <br />"This
          brilliant and beautifully written book is a must-read for all those
          who believe our economic system is terminally sick and in need of
          radical, sacred rehaul. I hope this book begins a serious, worldwide
          conversation on how we can reinvent our attitude to money." <br /><b
            >—Andrew Harvey, author of
            <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i></b
          ><br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>The Ascent of Humanity</i></b>
          <br />"Brilliant and original, with great depth of insight and
          understanding. The Ascent of Humanity easily ranks with the works of
          such giants of our age as David Bohm, Julian Jaynes, Jean Gebser,
          Alfred North Whitehead...." <br /><b
            >—Joseph Chilton Pearce, author of
            <i>The Crack in the Cosmic Egg</i></b
          ><br /><br />“A powerful pick for any who would combine spiritual
          perspectives with social change. This book thwarts cynicism and offers
          keys to connecting personal choices to powerful change. … An
          uplifting, inspirational, spiritual and social examination recommended
          for a wide range of readers looking for positive encouragement.”<br />
