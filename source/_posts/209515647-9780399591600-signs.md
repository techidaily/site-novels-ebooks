            ><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER • A renowned psychic medium
            teaches us how to recognize and interpret the life-changing messages
            from loved ones and spirit guides on the Other Side.</b

            >“A collection of incredible stories . . . that speak to the
            universe’s endless capacity for magical moments.”—goop <br /></b
          ><br />
          Laura Lynne Jackson is a psychic medium and the author of the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Light Between Us</i>. She
          possesses an incredible gift: the ability to communicate with loved
          ones who have passed, convey messages of love and healing, and impart
          a greater understanding of our interconnectedness. Though her
          abilities are exceptional, they are not unique, and that is the
          message at the core of this book. Understanding “the secret language
          of the universe” is a gift available to all. As we learn to ask for
          and recognize signs from the other side, we will start to find meaning
          where before there was only confusion, and see light in the darkness.
          We may decide to change paths, push toward love, pursue joy, and
          engage with life in a whole new way.<br /><br />
          In <i>Signs,</i> Jackson is able to bring the mystical into the
          everyday. She relates stories of people who have experienced uncanny
          revelations and instances of unexplained synchronicity, as well as
          others drawn from her own experience. There’s the lost child who
          appears to his mother as a deer that approaches her unhesitatingly at
          a highway rest stop; the name written on a dollar bill that lets a
          terrified wife know that her husband will be okay; the Elvis Presley
          song that arrives at the exact moment of Jackson’s own father’s
          passing; and many others. This is a book that is inspiring and
          practical, deeply comforting and wonderfully motivational, in asking
          us to see beyond ourselves to a more magnificent universal design.

          “This most hopeful work is a peek behind the scenes of the universe,
          reading it is like receiving a private message from God. Its essence
          is this: While one’s body is temporary, one’s love lives
          forever.&nbsp; What a thought!”<b

            <i>Advice Not Given: A Guide to Getting Over Yourself</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          “Our collective understanding of the nature of reality is undergoing a
          massive shift that is progressively revealing the interaction between
          the human spirit and the universe at large. <i>Signs </i>offers a
          tremendously liberating and empowering resource for those willing to
          take charge of such knowing and awareness. Hardships and difficulties
          become the engines of our personal growth. Laura Lynne Jackson, a
          scientifically validated psychic medium, shares her sage observations,
          which allow any true seeker to participate in the expression
          of&nbsp;their highest dreams and aspirations. This book is a rare
          treasure.”<b

          ><br /><br />“Laura Lynne Jackson is a gift to the world. In
          <i>Signs: The Secret Language of the Universe</i>, she shows us how to
          open our eyes and ears to the extraordinary messages of love that
          surround us, right here, right now, in our ordinary lives. I finished
          this book feeling less alone and more alive.”<b
