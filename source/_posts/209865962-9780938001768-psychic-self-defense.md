            Complete Guide to Protecting Yourself Against Psychic, Magickal
            &amp; Paranormal Attack (and just plain irksome people)
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever felt a negative energy come over you for no apparent
            reason when you are near someone or around certain places? Had a
            curse hurled at you? Been spooked by a ghost in a building?
            Imperiled by demonic forces? Been drained and discombobulated by an
            energy vampire? Or, do you encounter more mundane but still
            disruptive negative energies like an over demanding boss, the local
            bully, hurtful gossip, a physically or mentally abusive spouse, or
            life in a dangerous neighborhood threatened by thieves and violence?
            Whatever your source of negative energy, danger or threat, you'll
            find effective, proven, psychic and magickal countermeasures within
            this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            Psychic Self Defense draws upon Embrosewyn's six decades of personal
            experience using psychic abilities and magickal defenses to thwart,
            counter and send back to sender, any and all hostile paranormal
            threats. Everything from unsupportive and dismissive family and
            friends, to ghosts, demons and exorcisms. The same practical and
            easy to learn magickal techniques can be mastered by anyone serious
            enough to give it some time and practice, and can aid you immensely
            with a host of material world challenges as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            17 psychic and paranormal threats are covered with exact, effective
            counter measures, including many real life examples from
            Embrosewyn's comprehensive personal experiences with the paranormal,
            devising what works and what doesn't from hard won trial and error.

            security with the proven psychic and magickal methods outlined in

            and material world threats, the entire approach of this book is from
            a position of personal empowerment, having no fear, and using divine
            white light and magick. Whether you are religious or an atheist, an

          “The author is passionate about what he writes. He has the ability to
          draw you into the moment as if he is right there at the time of
          writing this guide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the tips he offers for psychic defense are equally powerful in
          any realm of life. The information presented here can be taken in many
          different ways and applied to your life. Whether you are a Christian,
          psychic yourself, or just someone wishing to protect yourself from
          negative energies, there is something to gain from this
          book.”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Gliding with God
        </p>
        <p>
          “Pyschic Self Defense is a must read for everyone in these trying
          times. Its simply described techniques are very powerful&nbsp; and
          most importantly shared by the author with so much of love and
          compassion for the humanity.”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Sunita~
        </p>
        <p>
          “Psychic Self Defense is an excellent guide to learning how to defend
          yourself psychically. In it you will find a step by step guide to
          understanding how to protect yourself and why these methods work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend this book! With the author’s experience and his
          gift for teaching you will find it an excellent investment in
          protection.”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Amy Taylor~
        </p>
        <p>
          “ I love this book for 2 reasons. First it validated that I wasn't
          alone! Other people are having these experiences too! Written in
          plain, heart-to-heart language that was easy to understand and
          meaningful. Second because it is the missing 'instruction manual' of
          what to do for basic protection. I am a long way from feeling safe
          enough to do much contact with what I know to be there, but grateful
          for something to hold on to that I can use. Simple enough that I can
          teach my son who is also sensitive. Priceless to be able to offer some
          solace. Thanks for such a great book!”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Nicole Artus~
        </p>
        <p>
          “This is a great book. It is easy to read and covers psychic defense
          from many angles. I have experienced many psychic and paranormal
          events in my life and everything the author says rings true. I like
          how he took some time to explain how salt works to repel negative
          entities. Even though I am very experienced with using salt to purify
          rooms and drive out negative energies and entities, I learned some new
          things in how and why salt does work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The author presents not just "ritualistic" type of techniques in
          self-defense, but also the more preventative and proactive things you
          can do in your behavior and thinking to ward off negativity in general
          as well keeping negative energies and entities at bay.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I have experienced many paranormal things, I can tell the author
          has too through what he says and how he says it. For me, it's great to
          have found someone that I know is legit.
        </p>
        <p>
          I highly recommend this book.”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Simon Cowell of Book
          Reviews~
        </p>
        <p>
          “So much about this book can be put to use by most anyone without
          needing to purchase a great deal of expensive supplies as is
          recommended by others. Also, background knowledge of the subject prior
          to reading is not necessary to benefit from the information available
          to you in this book.
        </p>
        <p>
          I especially like the section herein where the importance of one's
          teacher having one's true best interests at heart is discussed.
          Wonderful read &amp; invaluable information.”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Reiki
          Master Kate~
        </p>
        <p>
          “This book is necessary for novice spiritual aspirants who have no
          idea about working salt, visualization, crystals and blocking vampiric
          beings. Little unbeknownst details such as drinking a 1/2 cup of salt
          water before watching a horror movie, which is pertinent to
          maintaining spiritual protection was disclosed. Knowledge relevant to
          energy shields: reflection, transmutation, and absorption changed my
          situation overnight.”&nbsp;&nbsp; ~Jasmine Bozeman~
