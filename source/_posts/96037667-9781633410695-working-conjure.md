              >"<i>Working Conjure</i> is a blessing. With the increasing
              commodification of African American and African Diasporic
              traditions, books about our practices that are simple, direct, and
              useful seem few and far between. Hoodoo Sen Moise manages to
              balance a solid delivery on the practice of Conjure with just
              enough theory to create a foundation to do this spiritual
              work—which is not, as he also reminds us, spiritual easy—and to
              continue the work given to us by our ancestors to heal each other
              and the world we share."—Mambo Chita Tann, author of
              <i>Haitian Vodou</i><br />
              &nbsp;</b
            ><br />
            Conjure, also known as Hoodoo or Rootwork, is an old and powerful
            system of North American folk magic. Its roots derive primarily from
            West and Central African spiritual traditions but it developed
            during the slave trade and its purpose at that time was to help ease
            the terrible oppression experienced by the slaves.
            <i>Working Conjure</i> explores the history, culture, principles,
            fundamentals, and ethics of Conjure, while simultaneously serving as
            a practical how-to guide for actually doing the work.<br /><br />
            Author Hoodoo Sen Moise has been a practitioner for nearly forty
            years. In <i>Working Conjure</i>, his first book, he shares the
            techniques and lessons that will bring Hoodoo alive to those who are
            new to the practice as well as useful and enlightening information
            for the adept. In the book he:

          rituals, and workings for various purposesGuides readers to learn how
          to bring this profound school of magic to life “Conjure,” writes
          Hoodoo Sen Moise, “is not a religion or spiritual path, per se, but
          rather magic/spiritual work that is done to bring about change in a
          situation. Whether that situation is a relationship, money, a job,
          revenge, healing, or cleansing, the fundamental tenet of Conjure is to
          do work that changes the circumstance.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Hoodoo Sen Moise</b> (pronounced mo-eez) was raised in Southern
          Conjure and Hoodoo. As a child, he was taught by his grandfather to
          speak with the ancestors and, by the age of four, was able to see the
          spirits and had learned to open the door to power, wisdom, and
          service. He is now among the foremost authorities on the topic and
          also an initiated practitioner of several African Diaspora traditions.
          Hoodoo Sen Moise resides in New Orleans, where he is co-owner of the
          shop Conjure New Orleans with author Starr Casas. He teaches in New
          Orleans, Salem, and elsewhere in the United States.
          <i>Working Conjure</i> is his first book.
