            >WISDOM FROM THE WOMEN HEALERS OF THE PSYCHEDELIC
            UNDERGROUND</strong
          ><br />
          <br />
          The use of entheogens, or psychedelics, is out of the closet today.
          LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, and other medicines once associated only with
          the counterculture are now being legally studied for their healing
          properties. But as Rachel Harris shows, the underground use and study
          of psychedelics by women dates back to the Eleusinian Mysteries of
          ancient Greece.<br />
          <br />
          Harris interviews the modern women elders carrying on this tradition
          to gather their hard-won wisdom of experience. Any reader interested
          in inspiration, healing, and enlightenment will find here a
          wonder-filled narrative packed with provocative and perhaps
          life-changing insight.<br />

          “The space of psychedelic ceremony is vast — a sacred ocean. This
          remarkable book is a narrative distillation of knowledge and insight
          informed through extensive conversation with women ceremony leaders
          from the psychedelic underground of contemporary Western society. It
          is a skillfully woven pedagogical treasure for present and future
          generations of healers — a sourcebook of wisdom jewels from medicine
          women who operate with intuitions cultivated over decades and
          thousands of hours of immersive practice. A true gem!”<br />

          ><br />
          “Rachel Harris has delivered a singular book, inspired by in-depth
          interviews with fifteen elder underground guides, women with ‘more
          experience with the process of working with entheogens than any of the
          academic research teams’ involved with psychedelics today. The author
          brings her psychology and research background, and her study of the
          history of psychedelics, together with insights grounded in her own
          encounters with visionary realms. In doing so, she connects the wisdom
          of these guides with scholarship from multiple disciplines that the
          reader can explore for further learning. Articulating the ineffable
          conditions of nonordinary states — and the unique expertise of women
          engaged in ‘lifelong learning with entheogens’ — is no small task.
          With deep respect and admiration, the author interprets for the reader
          stories, wisdom, and guidance from these remarkable women, ‘silent and
          unseen,’ who have been ‘in relationship with these medicines for
          decades.’ Harris invokes the ‘existential reassurance’ that can
          benefit clients who work with medicine guides and therapists connected
          to ‘a much larger and more subtle world,’ who have centered their own
          healing in service to others.”<br />

          “What an opportunity! Fifteen wise women with hundreds of years of
          experience guiding psychedelic life-changing journeys share their
          stories. Rachel Harris has deftly woven their opinions, concerns,
          reservations, and reflections into a book-length conversation. Her own
          additional observations, personal experiences, and pertinent research
          expand the value of every other contribution. The result is a feast of
          wisdoms to guide the next generation, emphasizing putting healing
          others above all else to develop their hearts as well as their skills.
          This book is a treasure box of guidance and support.”<br />

          “Ever so carefully, Rachel Harris leads us into the deep end. Her
          storytelling pulses with life, illuminating treasures that have been
          overlooked for far too long. In gratitude, she reveals the untold
          stories of some of our bravest navigators. Swimming in the Sacred
          takes us on a delightful journey through the underground of this
          psychedelic renaissance and brings us back to the surface, for a
          much-needed breath of fresh integrity.”<br />

          “Rachel Harris has become an important voice in psychedelic studies.
          Her perspective is compassionate, balanced, informed, and pragmatic.

          necessary contribution to the field.”<br />

          “Swimming in the Sacred brings the stories of women who serve as
          underground psychedelic guides into the brilliant light of day. With
          gratitude and openheartedness, Rachel Harris honors their wisdom and
          commitment, without shying away from the potential for harm. The
          diverse practices cultivated by women over the decades, which span the
          distance between the psychedelic emergence of the 1960s and the
          current reemergence, contribute an invaluable perspective to the field
          of psychedelic care.”<br />

          “Swimming in the Sacred is an astute set of observations by a seasoned
          psychonaut, trained in psychology (but well aware of traditional
          perspectives), on the pressing questions of today’s psychedelic
          movement. Rachel Harris offers enormous insight into the possible
          nature of entity encounters, psychedelic therapy (and who’s best
          qualified to offer it), scientific and traditional metrics for
          assessing such matters, and other issues. This is a must-read for
          psychedelic explorers, coming at exactly the right moment in our
          collective journey.”<br />

          “Rachel Harris takes readers on a personal journey to meet women of
          the psychedelic underground, and along the way she reveals how women
          have been quietly but persistently nurturing a therapeutic renaissance
          that is not reflected in the scientific headlines. Beautifully
          written, this is a compelling and intimate look at some of the unsung
          heroines building a sustainable psychedelic future.”<br />

          “I would like to offer my heartfelt endorsement of Swimming in the
          Sacred. In this insightful and timely book on women psychedelic
          elders, Rachel Harris weaves together her wide-ranging interviews with
          fifteen women who have, for decades, at the risk of incarceration,
          been skillfully guiding medicine journeys with others as part of the
          psychedelic underground. These courageous women, impelled by the keen
          desire to help others to grow spiritually, were willing to share their
          compelling stories with Harris, who in turn crafted this lucid, vivid,
          and often wryly humorous text as a way to honor the wisdom and heart
          of these gifted women.”<br />

          “A luminescent light shines onto shadow aspects of the psychedelic
          renaissance in Swimming in the Sacred. Rachel Harris provides a
          long-overdue recognition of women’s hidden contributions to
          psychedelic healing, research, and sacred wisdom. Harris astutely
          navigates the paradox of shadow and light in the current explosion of
          collective interest in psychedelic medicines in the US by recounting
          the experiences of women healers who have traversed healing realms for
          decades, some underground and some in the open light. Through a
          Jungian lens, Harris weaves her personal experiences with the life
          experiences of psychedelic medicine women, including Harris’s healing
          through indigenous Shipibo healers of the Peruvian Amazon, writing
          with humor, clarity, and easy-to-read flow. Her book exposes
          vulnerable moments in the unfolding of psychedelic healing in her
          life, juxtaposing her intellectual skepticism of the nonmaterial
          realms with her curiosity and reverence for these same invisible yet
          real realms accessible through psychedelic medicines and the healers.
          Harris shares her personal process impacted by psychedelic medicines,
          revealing her individuation process, while deeply honoring the lives
          of scantly recognized women healers.”<br />

          ><br />
          “As with the women she describes, Rachel Harris’s gift is her ability
          to straddle different worlds. Weaving together academic research, a
          discerning psychologist’s intuition, and a deep belief in the
          transformative power of mystical experience, she highlights the
          critical importance of listening carefully to the spiritual wisdom of
          the underground healers among us whose work stands resolutely outside
          the Western therapeutic model.”<br />

          “This is an important and wonderful book. It’s full of surprises and
          revelations, facts and stories, humor and wisdom. Rachel Harris gives
          us an immensely helpful and necessary guide for anyone interested in
          the transformative traditions that emerge in all cultures from the
          essential symbiosis between human beings and the plants and fungi that
          make life on earth possible. It’s the fruit of a long life lived with
          courage, curiosity, compassion, and a wise and critical intelligence.
          The voices of these shadowy figures of the sacred underground are so
          important for us to hear now. The lives and practices of these women
          provide essential context, grounding, and cautions for everyone hoping
          to explore the powerful healing potential of our mysterious and
          elusive life-giving companions.”<br />

          “I’ve spent twenty-six years in the Amazon jungles apprenticing with
          one of the last of the traditional ayahuasquero shamans. As a gringa
          in that machismo society, it was no small feat. Now Rachel Harris
          proudly brings to light the wisdom of modern women in modern settings
          who are keepers of the psychedelic mysteries of the feminine.”<br />

            >— Connie Grauds, author of Amazon Medicine Woman<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “Now that the transformative potential of psychedelic exploration is
          once again spoken of openly, many curious but inexperienced seekers
          recognize that they would prefer not to make the journey alone. For
          the past half century, those who have had a wise teacher or mentor to
          support them have been remarkably fortunate, since our social
          environment has made it difficult to find this kind of guidance, and
          dangerous to provide it. Swimming in the Sacred explores the work of a
          group of women whose skillful presence in the psychedelic underground
          perpetuates an ancient spiritual and cultural tradition that has been
          carefully concealed during fifty years of reprehension and
          suppression. Without pulling away the protective cloak of discretion,
          this inspiring book reveals the work of these priestesses in a way
          that is respectful, factual, and instructive.”<br />

          “An invaluable account of medicine women, working at the edges of
          consciousness and societal consensus, in deep relationship to the
          unseen, in service and allyship to the healing forces of life. Rachel
          Harris has captured their voices with her exquisite narrative that
          draws us into the very essence of the felt sense, the tactile, the
          delicate, the mythopoetic worlds such work emerges from. As we are
          navigating the process of mainstreaming psychedelic medicines in the
          Western world, these voices bring a depth and wisdom that are
          essential for informing our ways forward.”<br />

          ><br />
          “In this poignant, inspirational, and heartfelt book, Rachel Harris
          takes us on a fascinating journey exploring the compassionate and
          dedicated work of women elders of the psychedelic community. Drawing
          from her life as a psychologist and a commitment to spiritual
          practice, Dr. Harris beautifully weaves together stories of the
          compassion, courage, and wisdom of these women, along with remarkable
          tales of the early history of psychedelic research. In these often
          bewildering times, this book reminds us of the essential human
          capacity for transcendence, meaning, and the awareness of our
          interconnectedness with each other and with nature, all of which are
          available through spiritual experience, potentially generated by
          psychedelics administered in safe, trusted, and supported
          relationships and settings. Harris elegantly reveals the ineffable
          wonder of human consciousness, including worlds of joy and suffering
          and the transformative wisdom within. Swimming in the Sacred is a gift
          and a refreshing delight, arriving at the right time.”<br />

          “Rachel Harris shows deep admiration and respect for the powerful and
          accomplished women she has come to know: the underground guides who
          connect with the plants that are the source of psychedelic medicines
          for our age, as they were long before the culture of modern medicine.
          This book, while it may be dense to read, carries the understanding of
          wise women who have lived at the center of the psychedelic plant world
          and have made their healing powers accessible. Here you will find the
          experiential complement to rule-bound academic studies that cannot
          acknowledge spiritual dimensions. Swimming in the Sacred is an
          antidote to the medicalization of psychedelics that risks losing this
          spiritual core.”<br />
