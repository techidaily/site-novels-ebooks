            Did Rasputin, the mad monk of Tsarist Russia, possess supernatural
            powers? Who was the mysterious prisoner in the Bastille who has gone
            down in history as "The Man in the Iron Mask"? Did he possess a
            priceless secret which Louis XIV desperately wanted to learn?
            Victorian Britain was terrorized by a weird super-athlete known to
            the popular press of those days as "Spring-heeled Jack." Was he just
            an eccentric gymnast, or could he have been an alien? Who or what
            was the mysterious man known as the Count of St. Germain whose
            abnormal powers seemed to defy both time and space – and is he still
            with us today? What strange powers of prophecy did Coinneach Odhar,
            the famous Brahan Seer, really possess? Was Bérenger Sauniëre, the
            enigmatic Priest of Rennes-Le-Château, one of the last guardians of
            a secret older than the Sphinx? Could the sinister Aleister Crowley
            have been merely a pathetic victim of self-deception and his own
            inflated ego, or did he really possess magical powers? What amazing
            secrets did electrical engineer Nikola Tesla control? Gurdjieff –
            one of the most amazing men of his time – has never been fully
            understood: what was the true meaning behind his strangely
            ambivalent messages? Was Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky a genius
            with strange paranormal powers, or merely a charlatan and a
            sensation-seeker? Francis Dashwood of Medmenham Abbey, leader of a
            sect of the wildest debauchees who roared their way across the
            eighteenth century, was an expert in the Black Arts. All of these
            strange, mysterious, and intriguing characters – and many others –
            are described, examined, and analyzed in
            <i>The World's Most Mysterious People</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a collection of remarkable and mysterious people, from all
            ages and places – including our own. Some the authors have met,
            others were researched carefully from reliable archives. Some are
            Canadian, others are from the US, the UK, and all over the world.
            All are mysterious; all are intriguing; all are worth studying. Can
            anyone learn to use mysterious powers like theirs? To update what a
            great thinker once said: "The proper study of people is other human
            beings." And the more mysterious those human beings are, the more we
            shall learn from studying them.
