          <p><strong>Transform Your Mind – From Beyond Your Mind</strong></p>
          <p>
            We all long for peace, love and happiness. And most people want to
            be successful in the world. But how can you enjoy these qualities
            and manifest abundance amid the often stressful realities of
            everyday life?
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately the solution is simple. When you break out of
            identification with your mind, you set yourself free to create your
            life the way you choose it to be.<br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><strong>Self-inquiry: The path of discovery</strong></p>
          <p>
            In an easily readable style, Leo introduces an updated form of the
            ancient wisdom teaching known as Self-inquiry.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Now you can:</strong></p>
          <p>Discover the power that makes everything possible</p>
          <p>Discover the peace that is beyond understanding</p>
          <p>Discover the joy that lives within you as you</p>
          <p><br />Who you truly are is who you feel yourself to be</p>
          <p>
            The simple process of Self-inquiry will bring about a shift of
            consciousness from thinking you know who and what you are, to the
            <strong>feeling</strong><strong></strong
            ><strong>of being</strong> who and what you truly are.<br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><strong>Who you feel yourself to be determines:</strong></p>
          <p>The quality of your life</p>
          <p>The quality of your relationships</p>
          <p>The quality of your success in the world</p>
          <p>
            <br /><strong>T</strong><strong>his present moment is the </strong
            ><strong>only</strong><strong> moment of choice there </strong
            ><strong
              >ever is. Just one new choice, one small step, could change
              everything ...</strong

          “This book has a wonderfully refreshing approach that makes living
          free from stress and suffering a real possibility for everyone. Using
          simple yet precise language and an easy-to-read style, Leo guides us
          into unveiling the peace living within us as our very essence –
          literally who and what we are.” <strong>James Twyman</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Leo isn’t trying to teach you about happiness – he’s offering you a
          taste of happiness. And not just any old happiness, but real
          happiness, the happiness that is a quality of our unconditioned Self,
          our true nature.” <strong>Robert Holden</strong>,
        </p>
        <p>
          “I love this book. It stands alone as a succinct exposition of the
          transcendental approach to being present in the here and now, with the
          emphasis on Being rather than doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being in the Now is an elusive skill and explaining how to attain it
          even more so. Leo has done a masterful job of it here, while managing
          to give of himself fully from the Heart in threading his own story
          into the narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading it, you feel you’re with a great friend as well as a great
          teacher and I recommend it highly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <strong>The Barefoot Doctor </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “If you want practical access to the Now, transcendence of limiting
          mind and deep serenity in daily life, Leo’s book is a superb resource.
        </p>
        <p>
          His explanations of our nature are down to earth and accessible. He
          gives you lots of inquiry exercises that are ingenious in their
          simplicity and effect. Yet what impresses me most is how effortlessly
          the book conveys the author’s compassion and his confidence in You.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading Leo’s book is like sitting side by side with a very wise
          friend who cares deeply for you and really can help you, if you’ll
          listen well, feel into what he’s saying and really do the powerfully
          practical work he offers.” <strong>Saniel Bonder </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “This wonderful book will become your best friend and inspiration. Leo
          has lled it with in nite wisdom, thought provoking insights and great
          questions to ponder. It is a book you will want to read again and
          again. It really will change your life!”&nbsp;
          <strong>Arielle Essex </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “It takes awareness and courage to challenge your thinking and the
          stories you tell yourself, but the benefits are much greater happiness
          and peace. Leo has done a great job of showing you how to break out of
          your conditioned thinking and into freedom.”&nbsp;
          <strong>Nick Williams </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “This book is an absolute gem. It articulates the timeless wisdom of
          non-dual teachings in a personal and accessible way that is deeply
          relevant to the challenges of everyday life.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a great down-to-earth style full of practical exercises gleaned
          from both his own depth of Self-inquiry and years of working with
          people to help loosen suffering, Leo brings the reader deeper into the
          stillness of Being. Read it and reap!”
          <strong>Miranda MacPherson </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Leo has returned to his natural dignity, compassion and clear seeing.
          He has a passion for inquiry and thus the joy of liberating the body
          and mind from the past and all misunderstandings. Join him on an inner
          tour and reacquaint yourself with your unbounded and unlimited
          naturalness!” <strong>Pamela Wilson </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Based on authentic personal experience of what works, Leo shares
          useful exercises and strategies that will help people on their path of
          personal transformation.”&nbsp; <strong>William Bloom </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Leo dives into necessary yet dificult topics of spiritual
          development, and its application to the real world, with an ease and
          comfort that makes it all very accessible.
