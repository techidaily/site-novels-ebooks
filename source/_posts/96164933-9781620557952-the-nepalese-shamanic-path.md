          An experiential guide to the shamanic spiritual practices of the
          Himalayas shared by a 27th-generation Nepalese shaman <br /><br />•
          Presents step-by-step, illustrated instructions for authentic
          Himalayan shamanic practices, including physical and spiritual
          healing, shamanic journeys, and ceremonies <br /><br />• Includes
          exercises to meet the ancestors in your shamanic lineage, techniques
          to use your voice as a shamanic tool, and practices for negotiating
          the spirit world safely <br /><br />• Details shamanic chants and
          rituals, how to create an altar, and the sacred objects of the shaman,
          along with exercises and techniques for using them properly
          <br /><br />There are few areas of our world where shamanic traditions
          have been preserved in their original context and form. Nepal is one
          of these rare and special places. In the shadow of the Himalayas
          Nepalese shamans, known as dhamis or jhankris, are still consulted for
          healing and divination, as well as for providing comfort and
          maintaining harmony. Following the devastating earthquake in Nepal in
          2015, shamanic teacher Evelyn Rysdyk and 27th-generation dhami Bhola
          Nath Banstola decided it was time to safeguard Nepalese shamanic
          knowledge for future generations by recording the practices in a book.
          <br /><br />With this comprehensive, experiential guide to the ancient
          spiritual traditions of Nepal, Rysdyk and Banstola present
          step-by-step instructions for authentic Himalayan shamanic practices,
          including techniques for physical and spiritual healing, shamanic
          journeys, and advanced ceremonies, such as the Kalchakra Katne, a
          shamanic ritual for removing toxic energies from an individual. They
          include exercises to help you meet the ancestors in your shamanic
          lineage, techniques to use your voice as a shamanic tool, and
          practices for negotiating the spirit world safely. They detail
          shamanic chants and rituals, how to create an altar, and how to use
          the sacred objects of the dhami/jhankri, including the mala, the magic
          mirror, the drum, and the Khurpa, the shaman’s magic dagger. Rysdyk
          and Banstola also examine the importance of Nepalese cosmology in
          shamanic ritual and spiritual deities such as Hanuman, Garuda, and the
          Nagas. <br /><br />Illustrated with photos and Rysdyk’s artwork, the
          book also explores the history of Nepal, its culture and myths, and
          the different ways Nepalese shamans serve their communities. Written
          specifically to share the traditional Himalayan shamanic method with
          the Western world, this guide not only preserves these ancient
          teachings but also reveals how they are still relevant in the modern
          world.
