            The most authoritative, comprehensive and up to date book available
            on dreams and dreaming, The A to Z of Dream Interpretation enables
            you to tap into a whole new level of knowledge and understanding.<br /><br />Uniquely,
            each entry within the extensive A to Z section offers three levels
            of interpretation based on the latest research - spiritual,
            psychological and everyday. Where appropriate, a fourth
            interpretation by gender helps you understand more fully the dreams
            of partners and friends. In addition, this book will help you to see
            the link between sleep and dreams, the different types of dream and
            how to deal with them, as well as the people and theories that have
            shaped dream interpretation and analysis.<br /><br />Written by one
            of the world's foremost dream interpreters, The A to Z of Dream
            Interpretation gives you the opportunity to heal previous trauma, to
            enhance the way you live and to reach for the best within yourself.

          Pamela J Ball is an author and career development counsellor who helps
          clients, on an individual and corporate basis, to progress
          successfully in all aspects of their lives. Pam's core interest is in
          healing on all levels and was sparked when she worked as a sick
          children's nurse. This was also the time when she developed an
          interest in dreams and their significance, which would ultimately lead
          her towards her career as an extremely successful counsellor and dream
          interpreter.Most of Pam's work - other than as an eminent author -
          over the last ten years has been as a business trainer and therapist
          in the USA, Switzerland and the UK. Pam has worked with companies in
          different fields throughout the business world to assist them in
          instigating management changes. She is also a well-known and
          particularly humorous after-dinner speaker. Pam is also a psychic,
          whose unparalleled powers in this field have enabled her to unearth
          some of the most amazing facts about past and present events, not
          accessible to most people, as demonstrated in her books.
