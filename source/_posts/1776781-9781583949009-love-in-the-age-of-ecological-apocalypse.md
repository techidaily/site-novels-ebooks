          Given the daunting, dire predicament in which we find ourselves on
          this planet, what is described by social critic James Howard Kunstler
          as a "Long Emergency" may in fact become a "Last Emergency" for
          humanity. Whether we encounter a "long" or a "last" emergency, Carolyn
          Baker seeks to offer inspiration and guidance for inhabiting our
          remaining days with passion, vitality, empathy, intimate contact with
          our emotions, kindness in our relationships with all species,
          gratitude, open-hearted receptivity, exquisite creations of beauty,
          and utilizing every occasion, even our demise, as an opportunity to
          invoke and "inflict" joy in our world.
          <i>Love in the Age of Ecological Apolcalypse </i>addresses an array of
          relationships in the Last Emergency and how one's relationship with
          oneself may enrich or impede interactions with all other beings.<br /><br />Drawing
          upon her deep experience as a life coach, Baker writes of the specific
          need to understand our key relationships in a society in collapse, and
          how to navigate through differing levels of acceptance of collapse,
          trauma, and grief. Key relationships include those with our partners,
          children, friends, neighbors, as well as relationships with our work,
          our bodies, our natural resources, food and eating, animals, future
          generations, Eros, and indeed, the powers of the universe.&nbsp;<br /><br />Baker's
          writing is engaging, inspiring, and often beautiful in its depth and
          candor. She introduces a variety of spiritual practices facilitate our
          developing a relationship with the deeper Self. With these practices
          and giving and receiving support from others who are walking a similar
          path, we begin to live more frequently from the deeper Self, or at
          least are able to access it more quickly when we find ourselves
          becoming embroiled in the ego.<br /><br /><br />Table Of Contents<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Introduction

          “Carolyn Baker has gifted us with a sane and courageous book that
          reminds us that whatever future may await us, it will be shaped by our
          capacity for connection. With an elder’s touch, she brings
          imagination, insight, and wisdom to the territory of love, extending
          our understanding of this essential experience far beyond our common
          associations. This book shows us that the only way out is through, and
          the only way through is together. In this late hour, Baker’s book is a
          primer to help us navigate the challenging times ahead in
          community.”<br />
          —Francis Weller, author of&nbsp;<i

          &nbsp;<br />
          “Few writers today acknowledge the true extremity of the global crises
          upon us today, much less the fears and grief that come up when we
          confront our collective predicament. Exploring all the dimensions of
          love—with partners, children, friends and neighbors, nature, our own
          bodies, and more—Baker offers comprehensive counsel on preparing for
          the coming Collapse by developing self-awareness, communication
          skills, kindness, compassion, caring relationships, community, and
          spiritual connection.”<br />

          “Carolyn Baker has done a marvelous job reminding us of the central
          place of relationship-building in our times of dire crisis and
          collapse. Through her work we explore how love is the source of our
          wisdom and the path to experience beauty amidst chaos. With words of
          great acuity and clarity, Baker stirs the mind and comforts the
          heart.” <br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>“Love In The Age of Ecological Apocalypse</i> discusses the myriad
          relationships humans are capable of forming and demonstrates why they
          are crucial at this time in our evolution. As catastrophic climate
          change threatens to eliminate many species, including our own, our
          relationships may determine how we live our lives and what we value
          most when we are surrounded with loss and confronted with the
          possibility of our own demise.”&nbsp;<br />
          —Michael Dowd, author of&nbsp;<i>Thank God for Evolution</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “With courage and grace, Baker tackles the issue of relationships as
          the unraveling of civilization proceeds. Who do we become during hard
          times? To whom do we relate, and how? This book demonstrates a path
          forward during the challenging years ahead.”<br />
          —Guy R. McPherson, PhD, author of&nbsp;<i>Going Dark</i><br /><br />
          “Another brilliant, wise, pioneering book by Carolyn Baker. The vision
          she is proposing here of sacred relationship is both sobering and
          profoundly inspiring. Read this book and give it to everyone you
          know.”&nbsp;<br />
