          An examination of our consciousness’s ability to pass between
          dimensions, both in life and after death, and how to communicate with
          spirits <br /><br />• Reveals that all beings exist simultaneously in
          the material dimension and in the soul hyperdimension and that our
          consciousness transcends death <br /><br />• Provides evidence that
          the deceased keep in contact with their loved ones and are able to
          visit them as apparitions, give them advice, and protect them
          <br /><br />• Offers rigorous scientific analysis of paranormal
          occurrences, including evidence of life after death, house spirits,
          near-death and out-of-body experiences, and communication with the
          souls of the deceased <br /><br />In this exploration of
          consciousness, after-death communication, and the validity of
          near-death and out-of-body experiences, Chris H. Hardy, Ph.D., a
          former researcher at Princeton’s Psychophysical Research Laboratories,
          reveals that all beings exist simultaneously in the material dimension
          and in the soul hyperdimension. During life, we can access the soul
          hyperdimension through heightened states of consciousness and dreams.
          After death, we cease to physically exist, but our consciousness
          continues on in the hyperdimension as a living soul, a complete
          personality able to perceive and even affect the material world.
          <br /><br />Through rigorous scientific analysis of psi experiences
          and surveys, the author shows that the deceased keep contact with the
          living by visiting them as apparitions, protecting them from harm, and
          even interceding to solve family problems or resolve their own
          unfinished business. She details her own psi and spiritual
          experiences, such as interactions with a house spirit, clairvoyance in
          lucid dreams, and her decades of communication with the souls of the
          deceased, including her own parents and scientific geniuses, and
          provides empirical evidence to support their reality. Moreover, Hardy
          offers tested methods for gaining access to the soul dimension and
          explores what can be accomplished there, including communicating with
          those who exist beyond our own matter world. <br /><br />Sharing her
          breakthrough understanding of the soul dimension as a hyperdimension
          pervading the universe, where our consciousness lives on after
          physical death, Hardy shows that we are all transdimensional beings
          and that the living souls of the spirit dimension welcome our
          interaction.

          "For those skeptical of the existence of psi abilities like
          extrasensory perception, telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, and
          clairaudience, the latest largely autobiographical book by a prolific
          author, Chris Hardy may very well change your mind."
