          An in-depth history of Rosicrucianism, its key members, and their
          roles in the formation and settling of America <br /><br />• Explores
          Sir Francis Bacon and Dr. John Dee’s deep influence on England’s
          colonization of America as well as the Rosicrucian influence on the
          Founding Fathers and on cities such as Philadelphia and Williamsburg
          <br /><br />• Explains how Bacon was the author of many anonymous
          Rosicrucian texts and how he envisioned America as the “New Atlantis”
          <br /><br />• Reveals the connections of the Order of the Rosy Cross
          to the Knights of the Golden Circle and to the Georgia Guidestones
          <br /><br />Dr. John Dee and his polymath protégé Sir Francis Bacon
          were the most influential men in the court of Queen Elizabeth I, part
          of an elite group with invisible control throughout Europe. And, as
          Steven Sora reveals, not only were they key members of the
          Rosicrucians, they were the driving force behind England’s
          colonization of the New World and the eventual establishment of the
          United States. <br /><br />From Avalon in Newfoundland to New England
          to Pennsylvania and Virginia, Sora shows how Bacon and Dee’s
          Rosicrucian impact is felt throughout North America. He details
          Bacon’s possible authorship of the anonymous Rosicrucian texts of the
          early 1600s, his connections with Sir Walter Raleigh’s School of
          Night, and the origins of Rosicrucianism in Bacon’s Order of the
          Helmet. He explains how Bacon envisioned America as the New Atlantis,
          a utopia where liberty and freedom of learning prevailed--a key tenet
          of the “Invisible College” of the Rosicrucian Order--and how Dee
          convinced the Queen that England had rightful claims in the New World
          by drawing on legends of both King Arthur and Welsh Prince Madoc
          voyaging West to America. <br /><br />Sora looks at Rosicrucian
          influences on the Founding Fathers and earliest settlers of America,
          such as Washington, Franklin, and William Penn of Pennsylvania, on the
          American Revolution, and on American colonies, such as the
          Williamsburg colony. He details how Penn invited Rosicrucians to
          Philadelphia and how the city’s layout follows esoteric principles,
          including a direct reference to Bacon’s New Atlantis. Moving into the
          1800s and beyond, he reveals how a handful of Rosicrucians served as
          the Inner Sanctum of the Knights of the Golden Circle and how
          Rosicrucians are behind the Georgia Guidestones, carved granite
          monoliths with messages in ancient languages. <br /><br />Providing a
          thorough and expansive view of Rosicrucianism, its occult origins, and
          its deep imprint on America, Sora shows how this secret society still
          continues to exert invisible influence on the modern world.

          “Sora’s informative new book is a must for those eager for the truth
          about the secret roles played by the medieval Knights Templar, the
          Rosicrucians, and Freemasonry in the founding of the ‘New Atlantis.’
          Now more than ever the world needs the truth about the individuals and
          the tenets they held dear, which was the secret blueprint for the
          founding of America. What was long ‘hidden in plain sight,’ Sora
          skillfully ‘brings into the light.’”
