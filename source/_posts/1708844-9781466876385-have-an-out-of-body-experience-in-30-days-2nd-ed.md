          phenomenon! Leading expert Keith Harary, Ph.D., and science journalist

          “People seem to be aware of the importance of exercising their bodies,
          but too often they look in all the wrong places for mental
          stimulation. This book makes people realize how exciting their minds
          can be. The exercises described in the book are not only fun, but also
          provide ways to keep your senses open to all sorts of cues.” —<i

          ><br /><br />“With interest growing in the training of the intuitive--
          the right side of the brain-- it is timely that a book like this be
          available to a wide audience. Books such as this one serve as guides
          to enhance the breadth of human imagination. It was a particular
          pleasure and surprise to me to find this work not only helpful and
          useful but sensually pleasing as well.” —<i
            >Ralph Blum, author of The New Book of Runes</i
          ><br /><br />“I have read Dr. Keith Harary's and Pamela Weintraub's
          new book on out-of-body experiences and am eagerly awaiting my very
          next free period of time when I can try the methods they suggest.
          There must be a lot of people like me who are very interested in
          reports of this experience but, rather ruefully, have not yet had the
          experience themselves.” —<i

          <b>Keith Harary, Ph.D.</b>, has spent decades investigating the issues
          confronting those who are coping with extraordinary experiences. He is
          well known for the groundbreaking studies of out-of body experiences
          conducted on the campus of Duke University in the early seventies. His
          research has included extensive laboratory and field research on the
          physiological and other variables associated with altered states of
          consciousness, including the development of specialized methods for
          actively inducing out-of-body experiences and other altered states.<br /><br />Harary
          holds a Ph.D. in psychology, with emphases in both clinical counseling
          and experimental psychology. He has authored or co-authored hundreds
          of articles and eight books on topics related to perception, altered
          states of consciousness, personality, and related topics, including
          several titles in the In 30 Days series. He is currently Research
          Director of the Institute for Advanced Psychology in Tiburon,
          California, where he continues to conduct research in perception and
          other areas in association with an interdisciplinary consortium of
          scientists.<br /><br /><b>Pamela Weintraub</b> is a longtime magazine
          journalist living in New York City and the author of more than a dozen
