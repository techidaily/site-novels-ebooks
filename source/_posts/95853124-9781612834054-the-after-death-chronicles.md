            This is a book about ordinary people—plumbers, artists and
            accountants, bakers and beauticians, teachers and lawyers—who have
            been able to receive communication from loved ones who have died.
            Included here are accounts from over 80 people across the country
            who have had contact with the dead through the diaphanous veil that
            separates them from the living.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book begins with the story of Annie’s deceased daughter speaking
            to her in the early morning hours. The communication was so
            transformative that she began to share her experience. Much to her
            surprise, she discovered that after-death communication is much more
            common than is normally assumed, and she began to connect with other
            folks across the country who had similar experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of the ten chapters is organized around a specific kind of
            after-death communication. Included here are chapters on dreams,
            verbatim conversations, and synchronicity through nature and various
            other physical manifestations, descriptions of the results of these
            occurrences, and advice on how to open up to after-death
            communication. This book inspires in the reader reassurance,
            courage, healing, and a sense of wonder.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>From the author:</i>&nbsp;“The time is ripe for people to
            recognize the blessing of how frequently our dead beloveds return .
            . . to confirm the reality that consciousness continues beyond the
            grave and to remind us that there is much more to death than the
            physical cessation of breath and pulse. It is time to break the
            silence, time to stop keeping these powerful healing experiences to
            ourselves. It is time to allow the experiences themselves, and the
            positive effect they have on the living.”

          "This book is a real treasure, one that will surely bring comfort and
          reassurance to those who are grieving the loss of a loved one, those
          facing terminal illness, those seeking greater spiritual insight and
          people everywhere who yearn for more insight about the transcendent
          meaning of death. The after-death encounters Annie Mattingley shares
          with us in her delightful book are powerful teachers, each one. They
          instruct that while we are indeed mortal because our physical bodies
          die, there is another aspect of our being which is immortal, a
          surviving inner essence which continues after the transition we call
          death to embrace the joyous experience of eternal existence." --<b
