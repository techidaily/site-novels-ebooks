            >A fresh and thoroughly modern take on Afterlife communication.
            Claire Broad is known as the Honest Medium, in What the Dead are
            Trying to Teach Claire shares invaluable insights into life after
            death gained through her own experience, whilst also drawing on the
            most up-to-date scientific studies on consciousness.</b
          ><br /><br />As a young child, Claire experienced psychic phenomena,
          as she grew older her experiences and the communications she received
          became stronger, resulting in Spirit teachers making their presence
          known and guiding her. Naturally analytical and now an adult, Claire
          was forced to question the validity of her experiences against the
          common academic opinion surrounding survival after physical death and
          embarked upon a life long quest for the truth. <br /><br />In her
          refreshingly down to earth, honest and open manner, Claire shares
          personal stories to bring comfort and hope to many whilst highlighting
          findings from consciousness studies that challenge our understanding
          of the world and encourage us to consider our true nature and full
          potential. Claire teaches us why we may have confidence there is life
          after death, how we can heal and awaken spiritually through the
          therapeutic practice of mediumship and most importantly what we can
          learn from those already on the other side in order to make the most
          of this life whilst we are here. <br /><br />By the end of this
          compelling book, readers will have an understanding that we all have a
          natural connection to the spirit world and will have gained tips and
          tools to deepen this connection; that death is an illusion; that our
          loved ones can visit us after their passing and that we can learn to
          recognise the signs; that genuine mediumship is a therapeutic practice
          and why visiting a medium is nothing to be feared; that spirit guides
          gently support us all; that it is natural for a child to display
          psychic ability and what you can do to support a child that does; that
          there is scientific research to support the validity of mediumship and
          psychic ability and that it is possible to seek evidence for survival
          as well as keeping faith.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Claire gave her first message from the spirit world to a relative at
          the age of 4 (al- though remarkably, she remembers being aware of
          spirit people around her before this). She started to develop her
          ability at the age of 21 with the hope that through developing her
          skills, she might help others and better understand the question of
          life after death for herself. She has 20 years professional
          experience, working in various ways, including 1:1 private sittings,
          public demonstrations, public speaking and teaching. She regularly
          runs workshops and classes related to mediumship and spiritual
          development. Claire has been accredited by the Institute of
          Spiritualist Mediums as a Registered and Approved Medium (ISM/RAM). On
          top of all this, Claire has also demonstrated to sold out theatre
          audiences.
