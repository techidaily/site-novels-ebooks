            ><i>New York Times</i> bestseller: A one-of-a-kind journey into the
            esoteric world of healing</b
          ><br /><br />You may not realize it, but just about everyone is a
          natural-born healer. In fact, you probably already have some of the
          paranormal abilities related to this gift: You may know who is calling
          before you answer the phone, or be able to sense what others are
          thinking or feeling. But you can further develop your inner talents
          and become your own shaman, capable of healing whatever ails you and
          effecting change in someone else’s energy field and body.
          <br /><br />In this uniquely informative work, master healer Deborah
          King introduces readers to Eastern and Western concepts and
          techniques, both ancient and modern—including her own cutting-edge
          approach to healing. You will learn how to protect yourself from a
          psychic attack and how to get beyond the limiting beliefs that hold
          you back. This kind of self-knowledge leads to self-mastery, the
          ultimate quest and the pivotal adventure of a lifetime. Take this
          magical tour into the heart of healing—and become the person you
          always knew you could be.<br /><br />“<i>Be Your Own Shaman</i>&nbsp;.
          . . will take you deep within yourself and allow you to connect with
          life in a totally different way. Anyone seeking the path of the healer
          needs to read this book.” —<b>Louise Hay</b>,

        </h4>
        <p>
          Master healer and teacher&nbsp;<b>Deborah King</b>&nbsp;was a
          successful attorney in her 20s when a diagnosis of cancer sent her on
          a search for truth that radically changed her life. Unwilling to
          undergo invasive surgery, she turned to alternative medicine and
          experienced an amazing remission at the hands of a healer. Along the
          way, she conquered the alcohol and drug addictions she had used to
          bury an abusive childhood. Leaving the corporate arena for the
          mysterious world of healers, sages, and shamans, Deborah mastered
          ancient and modern healing systems, ultimately developing a powerful
          healing technique of her own.<br /><br />Combining her personal
          history and wisdom, Deborah wrote the national bestseller&nbsp;<i
            >Truth Heals: What You Hide Can Hurt You,</i
          >&nbsp;which explores the powerful relationship between the
          suppression of painful emotions and their impact on our health and
          happiness.<br /><br />Deborah travels worldwide, helping thousands of
          people transform their lives through her experiential workshops. She
          offers a yearlong online training course, the "21st-Century Energy
          Medicine Program," for those who are interested in healing themselves
          and others. She also hosts a popular weekly Hay House radio show.
