          This handbook to spirituality gathers together Danish meditation
          teacher Jes Bertelsen's advice on training the mind through wordless
          prayer and meditation to realize the essence of consciousness.
          Bertelsen has been teaching philosophy and meditation since the early
          1970s; in 1989, he met the Tibetan lama Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche, who
          authorized Jes Bertelsen to teach Dzogchen, and to do so using his own
          judgment as to the most appropriate way to assimilate these teachings
          into Western culture. Bertelsen's teachings are based on an
          experiential investigation of the nature of consciousness, using
          comparative analysis of Eastern and Western spiritual teachings and
          consciousness practices on a foundation of modern psychological,
          philosophical, and scientific approaches.<br /><br /><i
            >Essence of Mind</i
          >
          outlines the author's experience and approach to Dzogchen, the natural
          primordial state of human consciousness that is timeless, pure, and
          untouched by suffering. The book is divided into three parts. The
          first part describes different methods for pointing out the essence of
          consciousness and the techniques related to them. The second part
          seeks to outline the key principles of a training system suited to
          Western students that can lead to realization. The final section
          outlines the significance of continuous exercises, and describes the
          way spiritual practice slowly permeates daily life, dreams, sleep, and
          eventually death. Through the mind-training process, the practitioner
          approaches an almost ecstatic state of completion, a luminous,
          blissful wakefulness in which the consciousness is also fully relaxed,
          not clinging to bliss or desiring ecstasy, but transparent and
          open.<br /><br />Bertelsen emphasizes that while more advanced forms
          of spiritual training can only take place in a face-to-face, deeply
          engaged mutual process between teacher and student, books are useful
          as sources of inspiration, in particular to help review one's insights
          and refresh one's practice.<i> Essence of Mind </i>systematizes the
          experiences that occur along the spiritual path and helps students to
          refine, correct, and clarify their efforts; it is the author's hope
          that many students in the West will be able to benefit from his
          comparative approach to Dzogchen.

          “Jes Bertelsen belongs to the very, very small group of people who are
          true lineage-holders of Dzogchen, held by many to be the pinnacle of
          the Tibetan tradition of meditation. He was authorized to teach in his
          own way by his teacher, Tulku Urgyen, one of the most revered
          spiritual masters of the twentieth century. This way, as it is
          brilliantly presented in this book, is clear, warm, and completely
          modern. Bertelsen unites a breathtaking command of Western psychology
          and philosophy with deep meditative realization. Here is, at long
          last, a lineage-holder of Dzogchen, a certified great teacher and
          scholar, who in a down-to-earth fashion can explain, step by step,
          what it means to transcend the mind—and how it is done.”<br />—Peter
          Hoeg, author of <i>The Elephant Keeper's Children</i> and&nbsp;<i
            >Smilla's Sense of Snow<br /><br /></i
          >"Jes Bertelsen guides us to a fresh perspective on perspective
          itself, with this engaging exploration of a perennial truth: that our
          ordinary consciousness gives us a limited view of reality. He points
          out the possibility of an unconfined capacity in awareness, and how we
          might take this step beyond into a fully open, naked awareness.&nbsp;
          <i>Essence of Mind</i> offers a practical map for those drawn to
          explore&nbsp; the far reaches of our human potential."<br />—Daniel
          Goleman, author of
          <i>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</i
          ><br /><br />“Jes Bertelsen’s words set the reader’s mind streaming in
          the direction of transdual completeness. Simple and spellbinding, this
          is that rarest of books—a genuinely profound page-turner you don’t
          want to put down. Its simple brilliance draws attention, not to
          itself, but to the reader’s own essential mind.”<br />—Anne C. Klein
