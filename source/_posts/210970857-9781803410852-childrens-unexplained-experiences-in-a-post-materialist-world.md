            Evelyn Elsaesser, expert of death-related experiences and project
            leader of an investigation into spontaneous After-Death
            Communications (ADCs)</b
          ><br />Historically, children's inexplicable experiences -- from
          telepathy and conversing with deceased relatives to out-of-body or
          near-death experiences, and more -- have been theorised through
          traditional scientific lenses that may not have the explanatory power
          to account for such experiences. In Children's Unexplained Experiences
          in a Post Materialist World, Donna Thomas shares research that she and
          other scholars, past and present, have conducted with children and
          young people across the world. By placing children's unexplained
          experiences and views about reality in the contexts of culture,
          consciousness and the nature of self, this book offers a middleway for
          explaining these childhood experiences within post-materialist science
          and philosophy. Thomas suggests that children's experiences could
          greatly contribute to a new paradigm for understanding the mystery of
          being human and the nature of reality.

          Unusual experiences of children and adolescents tend to be dismissed
          as the result of an Evelyn Elsaesser imagination or, more damaging to
          them, as pathological. With Donna Thomas, young people finally have an
          advocate who does not conduct research on them but with them. In this
          book, rooted in the most up-to-date scientific expertise and infused
          by genuine empathy for the youngsters who have those experiences, a
          new interpretation framework is proposed, based on the most recent
          findings in the field of consciousness research. What caring parent
          will not be delighted to finally have the information needed to better
          understand their child's unusual perceptions? What responsible
          professional will not be grateful to have the tools to assess whether
          therapeutic or pharmacological treatment is really the right way to
          go? Children's Unexplained Experiences in a Post Materialist World is
          a groundbreaking work with the potential to fundamentally transform
          the current clinical practice. It is also a must-read for anyone
          seeking insights into those unusual phenomena that their children -
          and they themselves - may one day experience.
