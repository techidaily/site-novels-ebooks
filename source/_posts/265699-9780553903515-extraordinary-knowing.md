          In 1991, when her daughter’s rare, hand-carved harp was stolen, Lisby
          Mayer’s familiar world of science and rational thinking turned upside
          down. After the police failed to turn up any leads, a friend suggested
          she call a dowser—a man who specialized in finding lost objects. With
          nothing to lose—and almost as a joke—Dr. Mayer agreed. Within two
          days, and without leaving his Arkansas home, the dowser located the
          exact California street coordinates where the harp was found.<br /><br />Deeply
          shaken, yet driven to understand what had happened, Mayer began the
          fourteen-year journey of discovery that she recounts in this
          mind-opening, brilliantly readable book. Her first surprise: the
          dozens of colleagues who’d been keeping similar experiences secret for
          years, fearful of being labeled credulous or crazy.<br /><br />Extraordinary
          Knowing is an attempt to break through the silence imposed by fear and
          to explore what science has to say about these and countless other
          “inexplicable” phenomena. From Sigmund Freud’s writings on telepathy
          to secret CIA experiments on remote viewing, from leading-edge
          neuroscience to the strange world of quantum physics, Dr. Mayer
          reveals a wealth of credible and fascinating research into the realm
          where the mind seems to trump the laws of nature.<br /><br />She does
          not ask us to believe. Rather she brings us a book of profound
          intrigue and optimism, with far-reaching implications not just for
          scientific inquiry but also for the ways we go about living in the
          world.

          "Experiencing anew the wonder of someone discovering for the first
          time that the world is not as it seems is a real treasure. [Mayer's]
          challenge to traditional scientists to take these realms seriously is
          equally refreshing."—<b>Shift</b><i>,</i> the Magazine of the
          Institute of Noetic Sciences<br /><br />"Logic meets ESP in a risky,
          profound, convincing new book. <b>Extraordinary Knowing </b>offers a
          revolutionary new way of understanding the world"—<i
            >O, The Oprah Magazine</i
          ><br /><br />"A remarkable journey of discovery, bringing together
          personal experiences and scientific experiments, and uncovering and
          dissolving taboos. Mayer has a unique ability to combine scholarship
          and sophistication with freshness and curiosity."—Rupert Sheldrake,
          Ph.D., author of <i>The Presence of the Past</i> and
          <i>The Sense of Being Stared At</i><br /><i><br /></i>"This important,
          paradigm-shifting book beautifully weaves stories of extraordinary
          knowing with a challenge to science as we know it: to help us honor
          and understand the true nature of these experiences."—Andrew Newberg,
          M.D., author of <i>Why God Won't Go Away<br /></i><br />"An
          enthralling account, amazing and convincing. Mayer's work holds the
          promise of enabling a new level of dialogue between realms of science
          and spirit."—Huston Smith, Ph.D., author of
          <i>The World's Religions<br /><br />"</i><b>Extraordinary Knowing</b
          ><i> </i>breaks the seal on the stronghold of the cool, logical
          intellect. Inside, we find exciting and irrefutable evidence that what
          we call 'reality' is far more magical and exciting than we've ever
          dreamed. What a fabulous book!"—Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of<b
            ><i> </i>Mother-Daughter Wisdom, The Wisdom of Menopause</b
          >,<i> </i>and<i> </i><b>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</b><i><br /></i
          ><br />"A fascinating exploration of the mind and of what it might be
          to be human.&nbsp; Mayer opens up intriguing new vistas for thinking
          about our deeper connectedness."—Adam Phillips, author of
          <i>Going Sane</i> and <i>Side Effects<br /></i><br />"A book to
          rejoice in. Mayer opens thrilling new possibilities for science and
          its applications."—Larry Dossey, M.D., author of
          <i>Healing Words<br /><br /></i>"A fascinating look at the power of
          non-local awareness to transcend the limits of the linear mind. Dr.
          Mayer writes with a sense of awe and fierce intelligence."—Judith
          Orloff, MD., author, <i>Positive Energy</i><br /><br />"Marvelous…the
          most exciting and important work I've seen in a long time. Mayer has
          courage as well as brilliance."—Louis Sander, M.D., Professor
          Emeritus, Boston University School of Medicine
