              >IN EXPLORING OTHER LIFETIMES: Memoir of a Soul's Journey, PATTY
              PAUL</strong
            >
            tells the fascinating stories of more than thirty of her lifetimes,
            including many in Lemuria, Ancient Greece, Old Europe, and Atlantis.
            Using guided meditations as observer and as participant, she began
            visiting her many lifetimes in the 1980s, and soon found it an
            adventure that helped accelerate her spiritual journey of
            self-discovery.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The premise of this book, unlike most others about reincarnation, is
            that all lifetimes are happening now, not in the past or future, but
            right now on multi-dimensional levels of the unconscious that exist
            beyond the physical realm's limitations of time and space. For that
            reason, every lifetime is accessible as a valuable resource for
            expanding personal and spiritual growth. And Patty Paul demonstrates
            exactly how it is done.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            As the story of each important lifetime unfolds in this book, the
            author shows how that lifetime is tied to her current life by the
            unresolved issues and strong emotions they share-the ties that bind
            them-and how through recognizing, understanding, then integrating
            that lifetime into the wholeness of her truer self-the greater being
            they are-a healing occurs. Like a stone tossed into a vast sea of
            consciousness, the result is a rippling of peace that impacts all
            her lifetimes at once.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            As they unfold in the telling, the author's lifetime stories in this
            book-each so unexpected and unique-clearly demonstrate the value of
            exploring one's other lifetimes, and why this book is an
            entertaining and important read.

            "As Patty Paul shares her adventures beyond our earthly boundaries,
            she reveals the scope and the immense beauty of the human spirit.
            Her book is a reminder that if we are willing to knock on
            dimensional doorways, an endless journey of self-discovery awaits.
            And if we dare, we too can fall in love with our courage,
            commitment, and our continual pursuit of the sacred within
            ourselves. Thank you, Patty Paul, for sharing your journey of
            healing and for shining a reminding light into each of us to do the
            same."
