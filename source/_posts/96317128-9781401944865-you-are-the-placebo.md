            >Is it possible to heal by thought alone—without drugs or surgery? </b
          ><br /><br />The truth is that it happens more often than you might
          expect. In <i>You Are the Placebo, </i>best-selling author,
          international speaker, chiropractor, and renowned researcher of
          epigenetics, quantum physics, &amp; neuroscience, Dr. Joe Dispenza
          shares numerous documented cases of those who reversed cancer, heart
          disease, depression, crippling arthritis, and even the tremors of
          Parkinson’s disease by believing in a placebo.<br /><br />
          Similarly, Dr. Joe tells of how others have gotten sick and even died
          the victims of a hex or voodoo curse—or after being misdiagnosed with
          a fatal illness. Belief can be so strong that pharmaceutical companies
          use double- and triple-blind randomized studies to try to exclude the
          power of the mind over the body when evaluating new drugs.<br /><br />
          “In his paradigm-altering book, <i>You Are the Placebo</i>, Dr. Joe
          Dispenza catapults us beyond thinking of the placebo effect as an
          anomaly. Dispenza gives us rock-solid reasons to accept the
          game-changer of our lives: that the placebo effect is actually us,
          proving to ourselves the greatest possibilities of healing, miracles,
          and longevity! I love this book.”<br />
          — Gregg Braden, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>The Divine Matrix</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Chapters Include:<br /><br />Part I.<br />Is It Possible?<br />

          Meditation Preparation<br />
          Changing Beliefs and Perceptions Meditation<br />
          Becoming Supernatural<br /><br />
          Dr. Joe does more than simply explore the history and the physiology
          of the placebo effect. He asks the question: "Is it possible to teach
          the principles of the placebo, and without relying on any external
          substance, produce the same internal changes in a person’s health and
          ultimately in his or her life?"<br /><br />
          Then he shares scientific evidence (including color brain scans) of
          amazing healings from his workshops, in which participants learn his
          consciousness shifting model of personal transformation, based on
          practical applications of the so-called placebo effect.<br /><br />
          The book ends with a "how-to" calming meditation for changing limiting
          beliefs and mental perceptions that hold us back—the first step in
          healing. <i>You Are the Placebo </i>combines the latest research in
          neuroscience, biology, psychology, hypnosis, behavioral conditioning,
          and quantum physics to demystify the workings of the placebo effect .
          . . and show how the seemingly impossible can become possible.<br /><br />“I
          discovered that if I could teach people the scientific model of
          transformation (bringing in a little quantum physics to help them
          understand the science of possibility); combine it with the latest
          information in neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, epigenetics, and
          psychoneuroimmunology; give them the right kind of instruction; and
          provide the opportunity to apply that information, then they would
          experience a transformation...<br /><br />This book is about:
          empowering you to realize that you have all the biological and
          neurological machinery to do exactly that. My goal is to demystify
          these concepts with the new science of the way things really are so
          that it is within the reach of more people to change their internal
          states in order to create positive changes in their health and in
          their external world.”<br />
