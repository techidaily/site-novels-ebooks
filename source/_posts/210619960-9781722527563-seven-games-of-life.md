            In this insightful book, Richard Smoley gives a lively but pro­found
            account of these games. He talks about how we play them, the
            mistakes we make, and how we can play them best.

              >The culmination is the Master Game. Richard explores prac­tices
              from the great spiritual traditions to show how to reach this
              mastery. If you play this game, you will reach new heights of
              wisdom, courage, kindness, and performance.<br

              >Intro­duction to the Occult</i
            >, interweaves ideas from great thinkers and traditions with his own
            dry and irreverent wisdom, gleaned from forty years of study and
            practice, to show how to play the most important game of all.

            “There is only one question: what are we to make of this life? Most
            books that aim to help with that central question fail, because they
            amount to lists: eat this, pray to that, think about the other
            thing, follow one truth, carry this thingamabob. Richard Smoley
            offers something better. It is like a conversation with a wise
            friend who trusts you, talking about this reality so you’re better
            able to relate to the ones beyond.&nbsp;<b

          Survival, love,and spiritual enlightenment are among the prizes we
          must seek, according to this lively treatise on the human predicament.

          Smoley,the author of<i>Inner Christianity</i>(2002)and editor of<i
            >Quest: Journal of the TheosophicalSociety of America,&nbsp;</i
          >posits seven metaphorical "games"that depict prominent aspects of
          existence. The survival game is won by procuring basic needs, but
          these can be quite different, henotes, depending on whether you're an
          English aristocrat or a homeless tunnel dweller in Las Vegas. Love is
          a game that's usually transactional, Smoley contends, with lovers
          judging each other by "the Equation" of desirability, but the secret
          to love is"the perception of the unity of all being."The power game
          can involve Machiavellian cunning-"it is never wise to underestimate
          the extent to which your subordinates can sabotage you"- or a numinous
          "power-from-within" that draws on a universal "life force." The
          pleasure game motivates us in everything from oral sex to champagne
          connoisseurship, while the creativity game is an interplay between
          form and innovation in everything from classical architecture to the
          absurdly standardized rules of movie scripts, which requires that the
          big plot break occurs on page 25. Smoley celebrates the courage game
          through the deeds of warriors like Confederate Gen. Stonewall
          Jackson-an example whom some readers will find problematic-and he
          proposes"death in battle is like a famous ride in an amusement
          park-something not to be missed at one point or another in a sequence
          of earthly lifetimes." Finally,the master game is the real rare souls
          who awaken to deeper wisdom, often through meditative exercises.
          Smoley's pensees mix an acerbic realism, complete with advice on
          office politics, with a mystical and even occult sensibility; he is
          influenced by spiritualist G.I. Gurdjieff, cites astrology as a useful
          means of assessing romantic compatibility, and mentions a "strikingly
          and unexpectedly accurate" palm reading he received. The book has a
          free-wheeling curiosity and erudition, and it approaches profound
          questions in prose that's lucid and entertainingly tart:"The
          lifelessness and superficiality of the current American literary novel
          cannot be because it has reached the technical limits of what is a
          very broad and accepting genre, but because, one senses, of some
          larger social vitiation: a masturbatory self-obsession has supplanted
          great themes and vistas." The result is a stimulating read.<br />
