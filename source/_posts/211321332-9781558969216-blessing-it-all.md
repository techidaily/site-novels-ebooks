          <p>
            Our personal lives and the lives of our communities are marked by
            moments of transition and transformation. As individuals, we grow
            up, we move, we start new schools and new jobs, we begin and end
            relationships, we have children and if we are lucky we get to watch
            them grow, we lose people we love, and we discover more about who we
            are. As communities, we honor people entering new life stages, we
            reckon with natural disasters and national traumas, and year after
            year we mark the cycles of the seasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditionally, we often mark birth, marriage, and death, and yet
            these are not the only moments that touch our lives and shape who we
            are. In this stunning collection, editors and ministers Heather
            Concannon and Allison Palm and contributors invite you to bless it
            all—moments that are ordinary and profound, tender and
            heartbreaking, joyful and celebratory, and everything in between.
          </p>
          <p>
            An expansive collection, the rituals in
            <i>Blessing It All</i> foster community, joy, and healing in moments
            like the joining of a blended family, changing names and pronouns,
            honoring Pride Month, having an abortion, getting a prosthesis,
            surviving sexual assault, ending a marriage, and so many others.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rituals—written by a diverse array of contributors with lived
            experiences that add depth and authenticity to each offering—are
            designed to be led by anyone inspired to do so, with clear
            instructions and additional insights and guidance. They are suitable
            for communities, congregations, family, and individual use. And they
            can happen anywhere our lives happen, wherever people or families or
            communities gather, because that is where we encounter the holy.
          </p>
          <p>
            May you find connection and commitment, inspiration and invitation,
            a blessing and a balm in these rituals.
