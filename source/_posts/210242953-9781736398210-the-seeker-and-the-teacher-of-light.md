            What if you could learn how to bring healing and harmony into your
            life, your body, your mind, your spirit, and the world by
            understanding who you really are-vibrationally?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            One night, Jerry Gin held up his hand in the dark. He could clearly
            see a beam of light stretching from his palm across the room to the
            wall. After a lifetime of seeking to understand how the universe
            works, and a highly successful career as a biochemist and
            pharmaceutical entrepreneur, he dedicated himself to being a
            spiritual seeker. Thus began a quest spanning more than two decades
            of fascinating research and exploration into the nature of what lies
            behind that which appears. And when he met the healer Joachim
            Wippich, Jerry's learning took off a thousandfold. The Seeker and
            The Teacher of Light is the fruit of this discipleship and
            friendship.

            Inside these covers, you will come to understand that we are more
            powerful than we might have ever imagined, and that our realization
            of Oneness is the key not only to healing ourselves, but also our
            world. Here you'll find:
          </p>
          Joachim's specifically phrased Affirmations to bring us to the I AM
          level, a higher, healing vibration affecting body, mind, and
          spirit.Fascinating experiments in consciousness, such as how plants
          react to human thought and how humans react (for better and worse) to
          their own thoughts, proving that we do indeed create our own
          reality.How the universe creates, and we can create with it.Sacred
          shapes that can be used to bring about higher-vibration energies and
          healing.How matter arises from light.How polarities can be brought
          into balance and harmony on every level.Dowsing and resonance, and how
          to work with a pendulum for well-being and healing.And many other
          elements that open us to our true identity as I AM - the One Being.

            As the author puts it: &nbsp;"This book is called The Seeker and The
            Teacher of Light. &nbsp;I am 'The Seeker,' as I have been on a
            journey to reach a deeper level of knowing, and have come to the
            same truths as Joachim, but from a different direction. Joachim is
            'The Teacher of Light,' because he has remembered who he is."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Whether you have already been on a quest for greater understanding
            or are just beginning, The Seeker and The Teacher of Light is for
            anyone looking for the next step in their spiritual journey-anyone
            intrigued by and wanting to explore the true nature of our
            individual and collective reality.

          "The Seeker and the Teacher of Light takes us on a journey to
          understand the being of our essence - the spark of life that begins
          even before we are a physical body. By understanding our essence, we
          can heal ourselves through bringing ourselves into harmony, into the
          Consciousness - the Oneness - of I AM."
