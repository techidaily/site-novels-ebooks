          Eyewitness accounts of Rolling Thunder’s remarkable healings,
          legendary control over the weather and animals, and inspiring
          teachings<br /><br />• Includes accounts of Rolling Thunder by his
          grandson Sidian Morning Star Jones, Stanley Krippner, Alberto
          Villoldo, Larry Dossey, William Lyon, Jean Millay, John Perry Barlow,
          Stephan Schwartz, Ed Little Crow, Leslie Gray, Oh Shinna Fast Wolf,
          Jürgen Kremer, and David Sessions, among others<br /><br />• Shows how
          his teachings and powers have transcended his death and how many of
          his climate change predictions have come to pass<br /><br />One of the
          most celebrated and controversial Native American medicine men of the
          20th century, Rolling Thunder (1916-1997) was known for his remarkable
          healings and for his ability to call on the forces of Nature,
          typically in the form of thunder clouds. He was also a passionate
          activist who worked to trigger social change on behalf of Native
          American tribes. Sought after as a lecturer and workshop leader, he
          used the money he earned from teaching to construct Meta Tantay, a
          community in the Nevada desert.<br /><br />In this book, edited by his
          grandson Sidian Morning Star Jones and longtime friend Stanley
          Krippner, we hear directly from people profoundly changed by Rolling
          Thunder, whether through direct experience or through his teachings.
          We learn of his legendary interactions with animals and the forces of
          Nature and hear from witnesses to his remarkable healings, including
          the healing of a young boy where a “mist wolf” was seen by several
          people. We learn of Rolling Thunder’s inspiring impact on men and
          women now devoted in service to humankind and the Earth and read
          stories both insightful and humorous from friends that prove his
          climate change predictions true.<br /><br />Revealing his trickster
          teachings, his legendary shamanic powers, his devotion to the Earth,
          and how his impact did not stop with his death, these stories of
          Rolling Thunder from a variety of sources demonstrate how
          transformation can come even while walking gently on the Earth.

          “These first-person encounters with one of the most intriguing figures
          of recent American history are by turn frightening, amusing,
          informative, touching, and mystifying. Rolling Thunder’s healing and
          wisdom were sought after by characters as diverse as members of the
          Grateful Dead, Muhammed Ali, and Buckminster Fuller. The authors have
          done us all a huge service by collecting these extraordinary accounts
          of a remarkable man.”
