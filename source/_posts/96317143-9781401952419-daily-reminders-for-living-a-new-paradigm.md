          As a species, says author, teacher, and healer Anne Wilson Schaef, we
          humans aren’t functioning very well. In fact, the societies we’ve
          created are actively destructive, not only to themselves but to all
          life on this planet and even to the planet itself. Clearly it’s time
          for a change. We need a new paradigm, and we need a way to live it.<br /><br />This
          new paradigm isn’t something we can outline clearly and implement
          programmatically. To arrive at a new way of living with ourselves, one
          another, and the planet is a journey that requires faith, because we
          can’t see exactly where it will lead. Quite frankly, where it will
          lead is, at this point, beyond our imagination.<br /><br />However, we
          do have some resources to bring to the table. Schaef, whose classic
          and beloved works include
          <i>Meditations for Women Who Do Too Much</i> and
          <i>Meditations for Living in Balance</i>, explains that deep within
          ourselves —in our cells, in our blood, in our souls —we have the
          ancient knowledge we need to find our way. We simply need to be
          reminded of what we already know —and this book is written to help us
          remember. Schaef takes thirty themes, one for each day of the month
          (months with 31 days get a “wild card” day), and offers a cycle of
          reflections on each theme that expands and deepens over the course of
          the year. Through insightful reflections on Beliefs and Assumptions,
          Honesty, Entitlement, Accepting Our Humanness, and Walking in Beauty,
          we enter a process that broadens our perspective and opens our minds
          so we can live fully into a new future.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Anne Wilson Schaef has a Ph.D. in clinical psychology and an honorary
          doctorate in Humane Letters from Kenyon College. After practicing for
          many years, she left the field of psychotherapy in 1984. Since then,
          she has developed her own approach to healing, called Living in
          Process, and has taught it throughout the world. She is
          internationally respected as a speaker, consultant, and seminar
          leader.Dr. Schaef’s 15 books include a New York Times bestseller,
          nominated for Best Political Book of the Year, and a two-million-plus
          bestseller, Meditations for Women Who Do Too Much. She is described as
          "one of the most important thinkers of our time," always "cutting
          edge," with "the vision of the eagle." Her favorite compliment from
          readers is that she writes what they have always known but could never
          articulate. Website: www.annewilsonschaef.com
