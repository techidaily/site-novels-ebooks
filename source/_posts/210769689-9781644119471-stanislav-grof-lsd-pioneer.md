          Includes testimonies from a number of luminaries in the psychedelic
          and psychological domains, including Jack Kornfield, Rupert Sheldrake,
          Ervin Laszlo, Richard Tarnas, Rick Doblin, Roger Walsh, David
          Steindl-Rast, and Fritjof Capra <br /><br />Created in honor of his
          90th birthday, this book celebrates the profound life’s work of
          Stanislav Grof, M.D., pioneer in psychedelic research and
          transpersonal psychology. <br /><br />Featuring an extended interview
          between Stan and his wife, Brigitte, the book explores in depth the
          full arc of his research in his own words as well as the history of
          LSD. He discusses his early experiments with LSD in Czechoslovakia and
          the United States during the 1950s and ’60s and the cartography of the
          psyche that resulted. He describes his clients’ and his own
          experiences and the psychedelic approach he pioneered. He explains the
          four perinatal matrices, illustrated with the impressive paintings he
          made during high-dose LSD sessions. He discusses the creation of
          holotropic breathwork as a way to reach expanded states of
          consciousness without the use of drugs. He describes how he started
          work with LSD believing it was simply pharmacology and then went on to
          discover the perinatal, transpersonal, and archetypal levels of the
          psyche through his lifelong research. The book also features
          testimonies from a number of luminaries in the psychedelic,
          psychological, scientific, and spiritual communities, including Jack
          Kornfield, Rupert Sheldrake, Ervin Laszlo, Richard Tarnas, Rick
          Doblin, Roger Walsh, David Steindl-Rast, Fritjof Capra, and Cathy
          Coleman. <br /><br />Complete with captivating photos of Stan Grof
          with Albert Hofmann, Swiss painter H. R. Giger, Fritz Perls, Sasha
          Shulgin, and all of the book’s contributors, this special book
          presents an impressive overview of Stan Grof’s groundbreaking work and
          honors his importance as a psychedelic elder.

        <p>
          Brigitte Grof, MA, is a psychologist, psychotherapist, artist, and the
          wife of Stanislav Grof. She first met Grof in 1986 in Germany and then
          in a Grof month-long holotropic breathwork seminar at the Esalen
          Institute, which led her to participate in a three-year training with
          him in Switzerland. Since 1989 she has facilitated holotropic
          breathwork workshops and trainings. She lives with her husband Stan in
          Wiesbaden, Germany.
