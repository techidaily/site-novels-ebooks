            >Achieve balance, connect to Spirit, and tap into the sacred power
            of dance with 365 daily movement meditations.</b
          ><br /><br />Throughout human history, people all over the world have
          recognized dance as an age-old yet timeless connection to Spirit. In
          celebration, to mark moments of change, and in times of despair, dance
          has been used to seek the Divine, connect with the Earth, and call
          into being the sacred energy we each possess within ourselves.<br /><br />In
          <i>Sacred Dance Meditations</i>, Carla Walter, PhD, offers readers 365
          dances--one for every day--rooted in traditions from around the globe.
          From Polynesia to Peru, each dance is different in origin and
          technique but connected in common purpose: as sacred conduits for
          hope, love, connection, community, and spirituality. Walter provides a
          theme each new day, drawn from mystical and spiritual principles that
          originate from pre-colonial religious traditions. Descriptions, video
          links, accessibility modifications, and invitations for deeper
          reflection allow the reader to engage their Spirit fully with the
          sacred power of dance, carrying it in their heart as they move
          throughout each day.<br /><br />Readers who want a more active style
          of meditative practice will discover powerful regenerative healing and
          a new way to awaken. Broken up day by day and month by month,
          <i>Sacred Dance Meditations</i> makes it simple and gratifying to
          practice each day's dance and fulfill its intended theme. Readers can
          begin at any "point of entry" section, and work their way throughout
          the year with a time commitment of just ten to twenty minutes a day.
          Importantly, each dance is designed to supplement any existing (or
          non-existent) religious or spiritual practice, allowing all to tap
          into the Divine through the spirit of dance.

          "This is a tour de force of insight and celebration of the sacred, a
          companion you will want by your side throughout the year. Not only
          does Dr. Walter guide us through the movements of the body, from the
          sacred dance posture to breathing, but she feeds our minds with the
          origins and root meanings of the dance we practice day by day,
          spanning the world and time, from Jewish mystics to ancestral
          Egyptians to Indigenous Iberians and more. She guides our meditation
          and, importantly, shares with us the ways we can carry on the ecstasy,
          knowledge, or spirituality we feel in movement to embrace our own
          humanity and the wider world. This book is transporting."<br />—Mary
          Jo McConahay,&nbsp;author of <i>The Tango War</i> and&nbsp;<i
            >Maya Roads<br /><br /></i
          >"More than a set of instructions for body movement, dance has been
          transformed by masterful Carla into an ecstatic embodiment of rhythm,
          mysticism, myth, and meaning. Daily reflections involve the whole
          body, mind, and spirit."<br />—Rev. Linda Martella-Whitsett, Unity
          Minister and author of <i>Divine Audacity</i><br /><br />
          "As a seeker and as a long-time practitioner of movement meditation, I
          found myself captivated by this meticulously crafted book. If you wish
          to live, as Dr. Carla describes it, in the 'temple of unlimited joy,'
          she and the opus before you will be your guiding star to making
          'elation a way of life.'"<br />—Lisa Napoli, author of&nbsp;<i
