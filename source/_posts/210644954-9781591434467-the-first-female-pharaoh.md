            >The cult, magic, reign, and resurrection of the first female ruler
            in Egypt</b
          ><br /><br />• Reveals the achievements of Sobekneferu, the political
          and religious issues of her age, the temples and ruins associated with
          her, and her continuing impact on ancient Egypt after her reign<br /><br />•
          Discusses Sobekneferu’s magical beliefs and practices centered on the
          crocodile god Sobek, the hippo goddess Neith, and their representation
          as constellations<br /><br />• Examines the modern-day resurrection of
          Sobekneferu among mystics and occultists of Victorian London,
          including her role in Bram Stoker’s shocking gothic novel,
          <i>The Jewel of the Seven Stars</i><br /><br />Cleopatra. Nefertiti.
          Hatshepsut. All of them are ancient Egyptian female rulers who rose
          above their predominantly patriarchal societies to become controllers
          of a great empire. Missing from this list, however, is Sobekneferu,
          ancient Egypt’s first female ruler. Why was the reign of this powerful
          woman all but forgotten? <br /><br />Piecing together the lost history
          of the first female pharaoh, Andrew Collins presents the first
          comprehensive biography of Sobekneferu. Using every text and monument
          that concerns Sobekneferu and her time in power, he examines her
          achievements as ruler, the political and religious issues of her age,
          the temples and ruins associated with her, and her continuing impact
          on ancient Egypt after her reign. He explores her relationship with
          her brother Amenemhat IV, her sister Neferuptah, and their father
          Amenemhat III, regarded as one of the most beloved pharaohs of the
          Middle Kingdom. He examines Sobekneferu’s untimely end, the fate of
          her body, and the cult that developed in her name.
          <br /><br />Discussing Sobekneferu’s magical beliefs and practices,
          Collins shows how they centered on the crocodile god Sobek, the
          hippopotamus goddess Neith, and Sekhmet, the goddess presiding over
          divine power. He reveals also how Sobekneferu’s suspected pyramid was
          positioned to align with the setting of Eltanin, the brightest star in
          the constellation of Draco, seen in ancient Egypt as the celestial
          form of Sobek. Examining the modern-day resurrection of Sobekneferu
          among the occultists and mystics of Victorian London, Collins shows
          how she is the true inspiration behind every ancient Egyptian female
          queen who comes back to life after her tomb is found—as featured first
          in Bram Stoker’s shocking 1903 novel The Jewel of Seven Stars and
          later in several modern blockbuster movies. <br />Revealing how
          Sobekneferu has left a lasting impact on culture and occulture through
          the ages despite being nearly erased from history, Collins shows how
          her continuing legacy is perhaps, ultimately, her true resurrection.
