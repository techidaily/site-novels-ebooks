            In this phenomenal <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, Neil Cavuto
            shares the inspirational stories of an array of personal heroes,
            many of whom motivated him to continue his career as he battled
            cancer and multiple sclerosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joining the nascent Fox News Channel in 1996, Neil was set to
            establish himself as one of business journalism's most important
            players. Ten years after being diagnosed with cancer, however,
            Cavuto was dealt another body blow: He was diagnosed with multiple
            sclerosis. As friends and strangers alike gathered to offer their
            support, he became attuned to the stories of others in the business
            world who also triumphed over serious setbacks of their own.
            <i>More Than Money</i> shares with us their personal stories, among
            them:
          </p>
          Evelyn Lauder, the cosmetics executive who pioneered the pink ribbon
          campaign after her own battle with breast cancerRichard Branson, who
          overcame dyslexia and used his creativity and entrepreneurial spirit
          to build the Virgin empire Michael Wilson, a senior executive at the
          Royal Bank of Canada, who launched a public campaign to raise
          awareness of and money for treating depression after his son committed
          suicideJon Huntsman, who survived two bouts with cancer to build one
          of the largest petrochemical companies in the world and found one of
          the most prominent cancer research centers
          <p>
            Moving, sincere, and wise, <i>More Than Money</i> profiles
            individuals whose stories are a testament to courage, compassion,
            and dignity in the face of adversity.
