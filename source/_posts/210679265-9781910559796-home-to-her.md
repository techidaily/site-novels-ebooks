            Home to Her takes us on a journey, personal and collective, through
            time and place, to remember and reconnect with the lost and stolen
            wisdom of the Sacred Feminine, an ancient Divine force known
            intimately by ancestral peoples around the world. While in some
            cultures She remains a vibrant, living force, in the West Her wisdom
            and traditions have been lost or buried by patriarchal religions and
            traditions.

          <p>Home to Her is packed with:</p>

          Stories and evidence demonstrating the power and presence of the
          ancient Sacred Feminine from every corner of the globe,Insights into
          what Her wisdom represents, how it differs from other spiritual
          traditions and what it has to offer us today,How to reconnect with the
          Sacred Feminine as a real, tangible force for good in your own life.
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            By reclaiming Her powerful wisdom, we reclaim our sovereignty and
            our ability to dream a more just, equitable dream for our future -
            one that honors the sacredness of all life.

          the call to walk the path of the Sacred Feminine and reclaim the

          the suffocating grip of patriarchy. As more and more people are asking
          'what happened to Goddess the Mother?' after these few thousand years
          of 'God the Father', Home To Her shares answers to this question while
          offering us healing medicine and a spiritual path rooted in the
          sacredness of all of life and the truth of your body and soul. A
          fascinating and soul-nourishing book!

          As I began reading Home to Her, I was transported back to my own
          experience in discovering the presence of the Goddess when she emerged
          in my consciousness and stirred in my blood and bones about
          twenty-five years ago. It was a time of void in my life, when the
          structures of my previous thoughtforms had collapsed. Somehow, I knew
          enough to not fill in the space, but to stay with the discomfort of
          the emptiness. It was in this emptiness I that began to hear a new
          voice from within: gentle, whispering, magnificent...and female. Like
          Liz Childs Kelly, my growing awareness of the sacred feminine was
          completely transformative for me, and like Liz, I knew I had to share
          the healing power of the experience with others - I had to share Her.
          Like Liz, I owe debt of gratitude to the women who came before me and
          opened important doors to our understanding of the sacred feminine
          historically and today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, my heart soars to enjoy a new voice. Liz so beautifully shares
          her own journey with the sacred feminine in an illuminating,
          authentic, guided
        </p>
        <p>
          way that will be life-changing for her readers. She is indeed like the
          Pacific Island "wayfinders" she writes about - offering insights,
          reflections and
        </p>
        <p>
          exercises to guide readers in opening up to Her and all that She
          brings. In sisterhood, I send abundant, heartfelt blessings to Liz, as
          we join together and with others in sharing the healing message of the
          Goddess to a world that so needs Her.
