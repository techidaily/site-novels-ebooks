              >As mentioned in his memoirs, Cheiro acquired his expertise in
              India. As a teenager, he traveled to the Bombay port of Apollo
              Bunder. There, he met his Guru, an Indian Brahmin, who took him to
              his village in the valley of the Konkan region of Maharashtra.
              Later Cheiro was permitted by Brahmans to study an ancient book
              that has many studies on hands; the pages of the book were made of
              human skin and written with gold and it is still guarded and
              protected with great care. After studying thoroughly for two
              years, he returned to London and started his career as a palmist.
              Cheiro had a wide following of famous European and American
              clients during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He read
              palms and told the fortunes of famous celebrities like Mark Twain,
              W. T. Stead, Sarah Bernhardt, Mata Hari, Oscar Wilde, Grover
              Cleveland, Thomas Edison, the Prince of Wales, General Kitchener,
              William Ewart Gladstone, and Joseph Chamberlain. He documented his
              sittings with these clients by asking them to sign a guest book he
              kept for the purpose, in which he encouraged them to comment on
              their experiences as subjects of his character analyses and
              predictions. Of the Prince of Wales, he wrote that "I would not be
              surprised if he did not give up everything, including his right to
              be crowned, for the woman he loved." Cheiro also predicted that
              the Jews would return to Palestine and the country would again be
              called Israel. In his own autobiographical book, Cheiro's Memoirs:
              The Reminiscences of a Society Palmist, he included accounts of
              his interviews with King Edward VII, William Gladstone, Charles
              Stewart Parnell, Henry Morton Stanley, Sarah Bernhardt, Oscar
              Wilde, Professor Max Muller, Blanche Roosevelt, the Comte de
              Paris, Joseph Chamberlain, Lord Russell of Killowen, Robert
              Ingersoll, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, Lillie Langtry, W. T. Stead,
              Richard Croker, Natalia Janotha, and other prominent people of his
              era.&nbsp;--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable
