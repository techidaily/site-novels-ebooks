          Actress and photographer Kris Carr thought she had a hangover,
          but&nbsp;a Jivamukti yoga class didn’t provide its usual kick-ass
          cure. A visit to her doctor confirmed her “liver looked like Swiss
          cheese,” covered with cancerous tumors. She entered trench warfare
          (wearing cowboy boots into the MRI machine, no less), vowing, “Cancer
          needed a makeover and I was just the gal to do it!” She began writing
          and filming her journey, documenting her interactions with friends,
          doctors, alternative “quacks,” blind dates, and other women with
          cancer—sadly a growing group. These include hip, young women such as
          illustrator-author Marisa Acocella Marchetto
          <i>(Cancer Vixen), Glamour</i> writer-editor Erin Zammett
          <i>(My So-Called Normal Life),</i> MTV&nbsp;personality Diem Brown
          <i>(<i>Real World/Road Rules Challenge)</i></i
          >, model Sharon Blynn (founder, Bald Is Beautiful), and music manager
          Jackie Farry, among others. &nbsp;The Learning Channel broadcast the
          premiere of Carr’s unforgettable documentary, Crazy Sexy Cancer on
          August 29, 2007.<br />CRAZY SEXY CANCER TIPS gathers the lessons
          learned and advice offered from Carr’s own journey, as well as the
          experiences of her cancer posse. Full-color photos accompany personal
          stories and candid revelations in this scrapbook of advice, warnings,
          and resources for the cancer patient. Chapters cover your changing
          social life, dating, sex, and appearance; essential health tips on how
          to boost your immune system; recipes; medical and holistic resources;
          and information on young survivor support groups. The resulting book
          is a warm, yet informative tool for any woman newly diagnosed with the
          disease and for those who love them.<br />

          "I read <i>Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips</i> cover to cover on a a flight
          from LA to NY. I laughed out loud, wept quietly, and most of all,
          marveled at the magic that is Kris Carr. If Deepak Chopra,
          <i>What To Expect When You're Expecting, </i>and
          <i>Sex and the City</i> had a love child, it would look just like
          Kris' <i>Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips</i>.&nbsp; It is sheer perfection for
          cancer 'cowgirls' and their loved ones—colorful, soulful, and
          intimate."<br />—Rory Freedman, coauthor of #1 NY Times best seller
          <i>Skinny Bitch<br /><br /></i>

          “Kris is a ray of light that is needed to raise awareness of what it
          means to give back. What more can one wish for? She is a true leader
          of courage and inspiration.”

          “Kris Carr has done something extraordinary with this book: She has
          put cancer in its place. She has triumphed, and paved a path by which
          others can triumph too. She deserves our most heartfelt ‘Bravo.’”

          When you have been there you know the experience and can help others
          survive their journey through the difficulties of life. Kris Carr's
          book is an excellent resource filled with tips on how to not only
          survive but thrive. If you have the inspiration, desire and intention
          to be a&nbsp;survivor the abundant information about life and living
          contained in this book will coach you in a way that will make you an
          empowered star performer and winner in the face of adversity.

          share her experience.&nbsp;This book will be a comfort to so many who
          are going through the experience or who have graduated to survivor.”
