            >The science behind the mind-body connection and how to bring every
            cell in your body into harmonic resonance<br /></b
          ><br />In <i>Resonance</i>, internationally respected cell biologist
          and healing facilitator, Joyce Hawkes, Ph.D., offers the best of
          science, spirit, and storytelling. <br /><br />Richly detailed with
          Joyce's experiences studying shamanic healing in South East Asia and
          stories of the people she has assisted back to health, this book will
          allow readers to explore their own ability to heal at every level.
          They will discover current research and fascinating findings about the
          language of their cells and how these tiny constituents of the body
          communicate, connect, and touch. Alongside this biological backdrop,
          they'll find fresh mind-body imagery, insights, and empowering healing
          techniques that will take them on a deep inner journey.
          <br /><br />Throughout the book, Hawkes also describes the profound,
          numinous experiences she shared with shamans, priests, and healers.
          Each chapter is presented as a couplet-two words, two related ideas
          that together provide a simple, grounded starting place for a personal
          practice of health and vitality. Resonance gives readers valuable
          tools to enhance their health at the cell-level, their spirit at the
          soul-level, and their consciousness at the mystery-level.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Joyce Whiteley Hawkes, Ph.D., is a biophysicist and cell biologist by
          training. She completed her doctorate in biophysics at Pennsylvania
          State University and was a postdoctoral fellow with the National
          Institutes of Health before settling in Seattle to work in research
          for the National Marine Fisheries Service, a part of the National
          Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While there, she was honored
          with a National Achievement Award for her work. She is currently a
          fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
          Joyce has earned an international reputation for her scientific
          contributions in the field of ultrahigh-speed laser effects on pigment
          cells and the effects of environmental pollutants on fish. After a
          near-death experience, Joyce embarked on an extensive exploration of
          spiritual and healing traditions in Western and Eastern cultures. From
          a master’s degree in ministry at a Jesuit University to Hindu temples
          in remote parts of Bali, she learned to work at the interface between
          the miracle of the body’s cells and the wisdom of healing traditions.
          Since 1984, Joyce has devoted herself to facilitating and teaching
          healing locally, nationally, and internationally
