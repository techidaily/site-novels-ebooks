          The modern world looks back towards Ancient Greece for the start of
          its philosophy, for the origins of its science and even for the
          foundations of its excursion into democracy. But is this either
          correct or fair? Was there something long, long before the City States
          of Greece flirted with geometry, astronomy and inclusive politics from
          which Greece itself developed, merely as a pale reflection?<br /><br />Alan
          Butler has put together his most exhaustive and yet most compelling
          presentation of how we came to be what we are today. The Dawn Genius
          explores the genius that was the Minoan civilization and shows how
          accounts of the fabled Atlantis were actually memories of a worldwide
          catastrophe that occurred around 1600 BC.<br /><br />The Dawn of
          Genius puts back into the place the missing pieces of the puzzle that
          is Europe prior to a massive watershed in population and culture that
          took place after 2000 BC. A cataclysmic volcanic eruption in the
          Eastern Mediterranean destroyed an almost totally forgotten
          infrastructure that encompassed an entire continent, and opened Europe
          to an unparalleled invasion of much less sophisticated people from the
          East. The book recreates the culture and religion and scientific
          knowledge that was shattered in an instant and which plunged the world
          into a dark age from which it has taken over 3,000 years to emerge.<br /><br />This
          is probably the most comprehensive explanation of mysteries from a
          truly ancient world that has ever been written. Those interested in
          exploring the genuine origins of the modern world are certain to be
          enthralled.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Alan Butler has spent 30 years immersed in world history, writing
          books delving into neglected recesses of the past, including ancient
          cosmology. Three of his books written with co-author Christopher
          Knight have attained cult status:<br /><i>Civilization One</i> (2004),
          <i>Before the Pyramids</i> (2009) and
          <i>The Hiram Key Revisited </i>(2010), all published by Watkins. His
          most recent title was <i>Rosslyn Chapel Decoded </i>(with John
          Ritchie; published by Watkins, 2013).
