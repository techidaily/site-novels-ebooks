          A guide to uncovering the enlightenment already within us <br />
          <br />• Builds on Buddhist, Hindu, and Taoist wisdom to express the
          timeless and ever-present nature of enlightenment <br />
          <br />• Reveals the negative impact of social and cultural
          conditioning on our psyche and how to counteract this through
          meditation and reframing our understanding of time <br />
          <br />• Shows how to uncover the original spontaneous awareness we
          were born with <br />
          <br />In this philosophical, psychological, and spiritual exploration
          of enlightenment, Jason Gregory addresses how to access the original
          spontaneous awareness we all came into this world with. He exposes the
          illusion that we must strive to reach enlightenment, uncovering how
          our yearning for future accomplishments, attachment to the past, and
          reliance on authority outside the self are social constructs that
          distract us from the reality of the now. The author explains how our
          original enlightened nature has been obscured by social, cultural,
          religious, and egotistical conditioning of the mind caught in time.
          <br />
          <br />Building on knowledge from spiritual traditions including
          Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism, Gregory expresses the timeless and
          ever-present nature of enlightenment. He illustrates how rigid
          practices and initiations can become a form of spiritual postponement,
          continually putting off our enlightenment because we feel we are doing
          something good and noble. To chase enlightenment through spiritual
          practice is to assume it is a quality bound to time. The author helps
          us see that we are already what we are seeking--once we understand
          that existing in this world is itself a miracle beyond words, then the
          magic and beauty of our world will unfold. In the same way we remember
          someone’s name without thinking about it, we also remember that we are
          enlightened when we stop searching for the experience. <br />
          <br />
          Emerging from the Middle Way of the Buddha, Lao-tzu’s Way of the Tao,
          Yoga, the Great Work of Gnosticism, the Hermetic Art of Alchemy, and
          quantum physics, Gregory presents a way to the state of
          consciousness--enlightenment, nirvana, or samadhi--in which eternity
          and time are one. He shows us how to counteract the negative impact of
          social and cultural conditioning on our psyche through meditation and
          reframing our understanding of time. The author explains how
          meditation in its truest form takes our awareness of nowness from
          theory to practice. Guiding us away from a time-bound understanding of
          enlightenment, Gregory shows us how to find ourselves in the stillness
          of now where the peace you are is the peace you give to the world.

          "<i>Enlightenment Now</i> and Jason's previous title,
          <i>The Science and Practice of Humility</i>, teach you one of the
          easiest and most effective practices for cultivating spiritual
          awareness, which is this: the moment you stop doing things, saying
          things, and thinking things and just rest in your basic unadorned
          state of being, you’re enlightened and you’ll know it, right here and
          now, not tomorrow or next year or in your next life. It’s really that
          simple, and it doesn’t require much effort."
