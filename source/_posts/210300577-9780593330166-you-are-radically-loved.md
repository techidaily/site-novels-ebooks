            >From the award-winning host of the <i>Radically Loved</i> podcast,
            an invitation to discover the healing power of who you are, body,
            mind, and spirit.</b
          ><br /><br />Growing up in East L.A. in the nineties, Rosie Acosta
          dismissed spirituality and wellness as something people like her
          didn’t do. But after being arrested at age fifteen, she knew that only
          a radical change would lead her away from debilitating anxiety and
          self-doubt. As she puts it, yoga offered her a ladder and she began to
          climb.<br />
          <br />
          In this empowering and accessible guide, Acosta leads readers through
          the essential spiritual practices she uses to create a radically loved
          life. With the arc of her own journey as a framework, she presents
          meditations, journaling questions, and practices for identifying and
          honoring our own radical truths.<br />
          <br />
          With grit and grace, this heart-filled guide makes spiritual practice
          accessible to everyone and helps you become the person you are truly
          meant to be.
