          From its earliest days, America served as an arena for the revolutions
          in alternative spirituality that eventually swept the globe. Esoteric
          philosophies and personas—from Freemasonry to Spiritualism, from
          Madame H. P. Blavatsky to Edgar Cayce—dramatically altered the
          nation’s culture, politics, and religion. Yet the mystical roots of
          our identity are often ignored or overlooked. Opening a new window on
          the past,&nbsp;<b>Occult America</b><i>&nbsp;</i>presents a dramatic,
          pioneering study of the esoteric undercurrents of our history and
          their profound impact across modern life.

          "What a fascinating book. So it happens that another equally
          compelling take on our complicated national narrative lies just
          beneath the surface of things; not the grand procession of presidents,
          generals, and wars, but something more hidden, more mysterious, but
          often no less revealing."—Ken Burns<br /><br />“Invisible and
          mysterious forces have shaped and guided the destiny of individuals
          and nations throughout history. From Moses to Gandhi, Jesus to
          Muhammad, Lincoln to Obama, hidden dimensions, in both our personal
          and collective consciousness, were conceiving, constructing, and
          shaping the course of civilization. In his precise and often detailed
          history of mysticism in America, Mitch Horowitz, has, in a way,
          tracked the evolution of our consciousness over 300 years.” —Deepak
          Chopra<br /><br />&nbsp;"A sparkling, down-to-earth and often deeply
          touching account of a powerful, much misunderstood force in the
          formation of America's cultural and spiritual identity." —Jacob
          Needleman, author of <i>The American Soul</i> and
          <i>The New Religions</i>."<br /><br />“<b>Occult America </b>is a
          truly remarkable achievement. Exhaustively researched, it takes the
          reader from the early concepts of the supernatural, personified by
          Mother Ann Lee, Joseph Smith, and Madame Blavatsky, through such
          modern-day figures as Henry A. Wallace and Norman Vincent Peale. It
          opens the eyes of the relatively uninitiated, in which I include
          myself, to the effect the occult has had, is having, and will have on
          the American experience.” —John S.D. Eisenhower, author of
          <i
            >The Bitter Woods: The Battle of the Bulge and So Far From God: The
            U.S. War with Mexico, 1846-1848</i
          ><br /><i><br /></i>"Religious people tend to be afraid of the word
          occult. Horowitz examines this aspect of life and religion in
          penetrating ways...and revealing its not unsubstantial influence on
          mainline Christianity. Truth seekers have always come from the edges.
          Religion itself should be glad they do." —John Shelby Spong, author of
          <i>Jesus for the Non-Religious</i><br /><br />"This book is a
          delightfully original tour through American history, as seen through
          the lives of men and women devoted to all manner of mysticism. Across
          these pages troop spiritualists, prophets, seers, psychics,
          numerologists, transcendentalists, theosophists, and historical
          figures from Mary Todd Lincoln to Marcus Garvey to Henry Wallace.
          Their stories are part of the deep-seated American tradition of
          searching for the new—a tradition that Occult America both explains
          and enriches." — Stephen Kinzer, author of

          ><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;“Fascinating…<b>Occult America</b> is a
          serious, wide-ranging study of all the magical, mystical, and
          spiritual movements that have arisen and influenced American history
          in often-surprising ways.” —<i>Washington Post Book World</i>
          Podcast<br />&nbsp;<br />“<b>Occult America</b> treats esoteric ideas
          and movements with an even-handed intellectual studiousness that is
          too often lost in today's raised-voice discussions about religion and
          belief systems.”&nbsp; —<i>Washington Post Express</i>
          <br />&nbsp;<br />“One of the most readable histories of American
          mysticism ever written…This is historical reporting that is crafted so
          well, it holds the reader much like a Voodoo spell.”—<i
            >Tucson Citizen</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Horowitz teases out fascinating stories of the
          ‘dreamers and planners who flourished along the Psychic Highway’…In
          showing how the paths of these figures occasionally intersected with
          the likes of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass and Franklin D.
          Roosevelt, Horowitz argues that the influence of the occult extends
          beyond the séance room and into the mainstream of American thought.”
          —<i>Washington Post Book World<br /></i><br />“A brilliant job of
          tracking down how positive thinker Norman Vincent Peale borrowed his
          core self-help philosophy from a religious movement called New
          Thought.”&nbsp;&nbsp;—<i>Washington Times<br /></i><br />“Exhaustively
          researched and written in a very accessible style...<b
            >Occult America</b
          >
          fills a gap in the knowledge of religion for most people.” —<i
            >Huntington News, </i
          >VA<br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“Excellent.” —<i>Library Journal</i
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“One of the best recent books on patterns of
          belief.” —<i>Fortean Times</i><br />&nbsp;<br />“A fantastic tour
          guide to the fringes of reason, high weirdness, deep esoterica, secret
          societies, and mystery religions.” —<i>Boing Boing</i
          ><br /><br />“Employing extensive research while writing with an
          authoritative tone, Horowitz succeeds in showing how a ‘new spiritual
          culture’ developed in America.”—<i>Publishers Weekly<br /></i>
