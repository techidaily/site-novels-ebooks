            >An eye-opening response to Aldous Huxley’s widely influential work
            on psychedelics, physical reality, and consciousness</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />What exactly are hallucinations? Are they actually
          doors to another reality? Anthony Peake thinks so. In this stunning
          book, he takes Aldous Huxley’s <i>The Doors of Perception</i> and
          updates it using the latest information from quantum mechanics,
          neurochemistry, and consciousness studies.<br />&nbsp;<br />Most human
          beings perceive the doors of perception as being securely closed. But
          here, Peake analyzes the concept of ‘the scale of transcendence’ and
          suggests there is a scale of perceptions whereby the doors are slowly
          opened, bit by bit, to reveal the true nature of reality. For ‘normal’
          people, glimpses of this reality—what the Gnostics called ‘The
          Pleroma’—are experienced during ‘noetic’ experiences. However, for
          others, the doors are prized open by certain neurological processes
          starting with migraine and progressing through various altered states
          such as temporal lobe epilepsy, bipolar syndrome, autism, and
          schizophrenia.<br />&nbsp;<br />A pioneering work on the relationship
          between physical reality and consciousness,
          <i>Opening the Doors of Perception</i> suggests that man can, indeed,
          perceive reality in its true glory.

          “This book not only opens the doors to perception, its careful
          attention to scholarship and exceptional intellectual clarity throws
          them wide open.”<br />
          <b
            >—Whitley Strieber, author of <i>Communion</i> and co-author of
            <i>Super Natural</i></b
          >
          <br /><br />
          “Anthony Peake’s fascinating book explores the underlying nature of
          consciousness as it is revealed through various syndromes and
          disorders. The book combines scientific evidence with philosophical
          inquiry in an elegant way, posing deep questions about what we
          experience as reality. A great read!”<br />
          <b
            >—Daniel Pinchbeck, author of <i>How Soon is Now?</i> and
            <i>Breaking Open the Head</i></b
          ><i><br /> </i><br />
          “In this deeply insightful book, Peake discusses the neurological,
          neurochemical, physiological and psychological correlations between
          pathological conditions and anomalous states of consciousness that are
          often associated with these conditions. Peake draws attention to
          commonalities between some of these conditions in regards to how they
          are linked on the spectrum of consciousness and highlights that a
          renewed perspective on consciousness could remove the seemingly
          ‘paranormal’ labels given to anomalous states. More importantly, it
          gives us a deeper understanding of pathological conditions such as
          epilepsy, migraine and schizophrenia and provides us with insight into
          how to develop potential therapeutic strategies for those who live
          with these conditions.”<br />

            >—Dr Penny Sartori, author of
            <i>The Wisdom of Near-Death Experiences</i><br /> </b
          ><br />
          “Anthony Peake is engaged in one of the most important strands of
          ontological inquiry of modern times, unravelling the Gordian Knot that
          is the mystery of our existence. Boldly researched, patiently detailed
          and with clearly explained examples of ‘experience anomalies’, this
          book underpins his non-mystical model of immortality, showing how our
          bi-cameral brains might interface with the universal Pleroma.”<br />
