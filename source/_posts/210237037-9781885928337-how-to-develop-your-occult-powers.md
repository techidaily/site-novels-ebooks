            Karl Brandler-Pracht, author of How to Develop Your Occult Powers,
            presents a comprehensive and detailed textbook in developing your
            occult knowledge, thus leading to an empowering of spiritual gifts
            and abilities to serve your fellowman. The spiritual insight gained
            in the exercises contained in the reading will empower the reader to
            fulfill his divine purpose, not only in gaining self-discipline, but
            also in allowing that discipline (as a disciple) to radiate outwards
            to serve mankind. The reader is led to soul-searching within himself
            through instructions that connect two great yogic systems, one which
            deals with the physiological part of a human being, while the other
            focuses on the psychic development. In this process, you will learn
            from the beginning stage of an apprentice, spiritual exercises that
            include the power of thoughts and their manifestation, the
            importance of breathing, and the use of magnetism. The reader then
            moves on to journeyman, which requires an higher ethical
            development, to learn the value of introspection and liberation
            through higher exercises to achieve an harmonious lifestyle. In
            implementing these higher exercises, you will be taught the power of
            the Od, the Infinite subtle substance that each human body produces
            and emanates, and how you can increase this vital energy to manifest
            with power in your spiritual abilities to serve others. In the
            journeyman’s exercises, such topics that are addressed include
            telepathy, higher breathing techniques, idealistic monism (supremacy
            of one idea), dreams, clairvoyance and clairaudience, psychometry
            (history of an object), and the healing power of magnetism. In the
            final development, the reader who has attained the highest ethical
            level is given the last key, the tattvas, to understand and sell all
            things through the “inner eye” and thus become a Master. As a
            Master, he has overcome the world, become one with the
            all-encompassing love, and lives only for a higher purpose — to use
            his power solely for the well-being of his fellowman. With his feet,
            he stands on the earth, but with his head, he rises into heaven. Now
            he is able to give those in need the enlightenment which he himself
            received when he needed it. How to Develop Your Occult Powers is a
            unique process of spiritual development and exercises to enable the
            individual to attain the highest level of empowerment for himself
            and for the benefit of those around him.
