            >The beloved New Thought leader and author of<i>
              You Can Heal Your Life</i
            >
            offers hope and wisdom to readers navigating mental health issues,
            difficult relationships, and more</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This book is a collection of letters I’ve received and answered over
          the years from people all over the world. The letters express deep
          concerns about 20 different topics—including addictions, disease,
          family relationships, the inner child, and parenting, just to name a
          few.<br /><br />
          Almost all of the people who have written to me have wanted to change
          themselves—and their world—in some way. In my replies, I’ve tried to
          be the catalyst that helps these individuals accomplish their goals. I
          think of myself as a stepping-stone on a pathway of self-discovery.<br /><br />
          Perhaps you will see some aspect of yourself in these pages. It is my
          belief that by reading about other people’s challenges and
          aspirations, we can see ourselves and our own problems in different
          ways. Sometimes we can use what we learn from others to make changes
          in our own lives.<br /><br />
          I hope this book will allow you to realize that you, too, have the
          strength within to change, and to find solutions on<i></i>your
          own—that is, to seek the answers that are within you.<br />

          <span>About the Author</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Louise Hay </b>was an inspirational teacher, incredible visionary,
          and self-help pioneer who educated millions since the 1984 publication
          of her bestseller, <b><i>You Can Heal Your Life</i></b
          >, which has more than 50 million copies in print worldwide and spent
          16 weeks on the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers list. She appeared
          on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> and many other TV and radio programs
          both in the U.S. and abroad. Renowned for demonstrating the power of
          affirmations to bring about self-healing and positive change, Louise
          was the author of more than 30 books, including the bestsellers
          <b><i>The Power Is Within You </i></b>and<b><i> Heal Your Body</i></b
          >. In addition to her books, Louise produced numerous audio and video
          programs, card decks, online courses, and other resources for leading
          a healthy, joyous, and fulfilling life. Louise was dubbed “the closest
          thing to a living saint” by the Australian media and in 1985, Louise
          began her famous support group, “<b>The Hayride</b>,” with six men
          diagnosed with AIDS. By 1988, the group had grown to a weekly
          gathering of 800 people and had moved to an auditorium in West
          Hollywood. In 1987, what began as a small venture in the living room
          of her home turned into <b>Hay House, Inc.</b>: the largest publisher
          of self-help books, events, and courses. Hay House has sold millions
          of books and products worldwide and now has offices in California, New
          York, London, Sydney, Johannesburg, and New Delhi.<b>
            The non-profit Hay Foundation</b
          >, established by Louise in 1986, continues to support organizations
          that enhance the quality of life for people, animals, and our
          environment. Websites: www.louisehay.com, www.hayhouse.com, and
