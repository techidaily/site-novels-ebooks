            of&nbsp;<i>A Course in Miracles</i>&nbsp;by the #1&nbsp;<i
              >New York Times</i
            >&nbsp;best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>E-Squared</i>.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>A Course in Miracles</i>&nbsp;is profound, deeply
          moving, and as boring to read as a bookshelf assembly manual.<br /><br />Ask
          for a show of hands at any self-help gathering, and 95 percent will
          happily admit to owning the dense blue book that's a famous resource
          for spiritual transformation. Ask the obvious follow-up, "How many
          have actually read it?" and all but a smattering of hands go down.
          It's as if everyone wants the miracles, the forgiveness, and the mind
          shifts, but they just can't bear its ponderous heaviness.<br /><br />Pam
          Grout to the rescue! Her new book is for all those still struggling
          with the Course. Grout offers a modern-day rewrite of the 365-lesson
          workbook-the text at the heart of the Course. Unlike the original,
          it's user-friendly, accessible and easy for everyone to understand.<br /><br />In
          daily lessons with titles like "The Home Depot of Spiritual Practices"
          and "Transcending the Chatty Asshat in My Head," Grout drills down to
          the Course's essential message and meaning, grounding it in the
          context of everyday life in a way that's bound to stick. The lessons
          here blend eternal truths with pop culture and personal stories that
          are laugh-out-loud funny and deeply soul-stirring, often at the same
          time.<br /><br />You won't be tempted to use this Course in Miracles
          as a doorstop. You'll want to use it, every day, to change your life.
