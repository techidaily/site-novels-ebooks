          <b>Less Fear, More Life—a Practical Guide</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />These days there’s so much fear in the air, you can almost
          taste it—along with all the varieties of anxiety, anger, and addiction
          that grow out of it. How can you navigate your way through the fear
          and confusion, and find your way to peace?<br /><br />
          In <i>Fear Less</i>, acclaimed teacher and award-winning author Dean
          Sluyter shows how to use simple meditative techniques and subtle
          tweaks of body, mind, and breath to open your life to deep, relaxed
          confidence. Drawing on ancient enlightenment teachings as well as
          contemporary research, he lays out practical, easy-to-follow steps for
          addressing such issues as:<br /><br />• letting go of compulsive
          overthinking<br />
          • loosening the bonds of addiction (including smartphone addiction)<br />
          • overcoming the fear of death<br />
          • finding meditative stillness in the thick of activity

          "Trying to be fearless often becomes yet another thing to fail at, but
          if you can just <i>fear less</i>, peace&nbsp;is well within reach.
          This book<i> </i>is your best guide for achieving that. Dean Sluyter’s
          kind, accessible tone talks&nbsp;<i>with</i>&nbsp;you, so you always
          feel he is by your side as you make the journey."<br />

          <i>"Om</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Wheeeeeee!</i>&nbsp;Sluyter&nbsp;careens
          merrily from the Buddha to Willie Nelson, from prison stories
          to&nbsp;<i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, but it all leads us—step by
          practical, loving step—toward a life of peace. Who knew that learning
          how not to be freaked out could be so much fun?"<br />

          person, I’ve long been aware that mindfulness would be helpful to my
          life, but it’s just so <i>intimidating</i>. Not so with Sluyter, who
          pairs concrete suggestions with a no-pressure attitude that makes this
          book feel like it’s written by a really smart friend. He also shows
          how to incorporate the techniques into other programs of recovery—a
          rare but crucially important component. You’ll want to revisit
          Sluyter’s wisdom again and again."<br />

          available to everyone.&nbsp;<i>Fear Less</i>&nbsp;is rich with

          teaching in prison. I’ve had the privilege of going behind bars with

          like a laser light, pointing directly to the truth we need to embrace:
          fear doesn’t have to own us any longer. Using various forms of
          exquisitely simple meditation techniques, the author doesn’t just
          point the way—he takes our hand and gently leads us. Dean equips us
          with the tools necessary to slay the tyrant that holds us captive in
          the dungeon of our own making. The dungeon is our mind and the tyrant
          is fear. Read&nbsp;<i>Fear Less</i>—it will help&nbsp;you&nbsp;set
          yourself free!"<br />
