            >An extensive classic work on the origins of ceremonial magic
            throughout the world’s many cultures and religions.</b
          ><br /><br />
          French occultists Alphones Louis Constant (1810–1875) was born in
          Paris to a shoemaker father. At age twenty-two, he entered the
          seminary at Saint Sulpice for an education that would prepare him for
          the priesthood. While he did become ordained a deacon, he found that
          his doubts regarding the doctrine of the Catholic Church precluded him
          from completing his ordination. A week before he was due to take
          orders as a priest, he left the Church and returned to civilian
          life.<br /><br />
          Through the 1850s and 1860s, Constant developed and disseminated his
          growing ideas of the occult, mysticism, and the Kabbalistic school of
          thought. He became a ceremonial magician and developed a social circle
          of other mystical and occultist thinkers. Eschewing the charlatan’s
          tricks and parlor illusions, Lévi believed that the practice of
          ceremonial magic required a strong will, psychic force, and powerful
          imagination to discover true science and influence reality. And anyone
          who attempted to use magic for personal gain would lead to their own
          destruction.<br /><br />
          Writing under the name Éliphas Lévi—a literal translation of his name
          Alphonse Lewis into Hebrew—he began to share his ideas on magic with
          the public. In 1860, he began work on <i>The History of Magic</i>, an
          assessment and analysis of sacred magic through many past cultures. By
          exploring the magical components of the pagans, Kabbalists, ancient
          Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Catholics, and many other groups, Lévi
          sought to find the secret wisdom hidden within each. He also explored
          the secret traditions of the Illuminati, Freemasons, and the Knights
          Templar, among many others.<br /><br /><i>The History of Magic</i> is
          an essential test for any student of ceremonial magic, revealing the
          truths behind the fables, allegories, and parables of these cultural
          traditions. Translated into English by the British poet and mystic,
          A.W. Waite, it was published posthumously in 1913. Waite was one of
          the creators of the well-known Rider-Waite Tarot Deck, one of the most
          widely used tarot decks in the world.

        <p>
          Alphonse Louis Constant, better know by his pen name Eliphas Levi, was
          a master of the traditional Rosicrucian interpretation of the
          Kabbalah. He was born in France in 1810, and through the offices of
          the parish priest, was educated for the church at Saint-Sulpice. He
          was later expelled from seminary for teaching doctrines contrary to
          those of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1824 Levi began studying the
          occult sciences, and wrote about magic and the Kabbalah for the next
          three decades. His other books include Transcendental Magic, Mysteries
          of the Qabalah, and The Book of Splendours.A.E. Waite (1857-1942) is
          one of the best-known authors and translators of magic and the occult.
          He is the creator of the Rider-Waite tarot and is the author of
          several books including Book of Black Magic and Pictorial Keys to the
          Tarot.
