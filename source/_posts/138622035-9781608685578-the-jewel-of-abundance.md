          ><br />
          Although millions of Westerners practice yoga simply for its health
          benefits, the philosophy and wisdom behind the multifaceted discipline
          have far more to offer. In The Jewel of Abundance, award-winning
          author and Kriya Yoga teacher Ellen Grace O’Brian reveals an
          overlooked aspect of yoga: its powerful teachings on prosperity. She
          draws upon the ancient Vedic tradition of yoga philosophy and practice
          and shows how spirituality and earthly success can complement each
          other, leading to realization of the higher Self. O’Brian presents a
          clear explanation of both the philosophy of yoga and the nuts and
          bolts of practice, such as setting up a daily meditation routine,
          incorporating mantras, discerning how to cooperate with universal
          principles for complete well-being, and cultivating mindfulness in
          action.<br />
          <br />
          Along the way, she illustrates her lessons with personal stories and
          timeless sayings from great sages, both Eastern and Western. With
          O’Brian’s insightful guidance, readers will discover an inexhaustible
          source of abundance that is available to them whenever they look
          within.

          “Yoga is the science of the self. It is a practical science that
          validates the knowledge that the self of the individual is the self of
          the universe. When you are one with the Source of existence, you are
          one with infinite abundance and with the unlimited potential of all
          manifestation. This jewel of a book will show you how to tap into your
          inner intelligence, the ultimate and supreme genius that mirrors the
          wisdom of the cosmos. Cultivate wealth consciousness, and affluence
          and prosperity will effortlessly flow toward you in all their
          manifestations.”<br />
          <strong>— Deepak Chopra,</strong> bestselling author of The Seven
          Spiritual Laws of Success and You Are the Universe<br />
          <br />
          “The Jewel of Abundance will inspire, challenge, and motivate readers
          to discover and express their innate potential to experience
          excellence in all aspects of life. Having known Ellen Grace O’Brian
          for almost four decades, I am pleased to affirm her good character and
          total commitment to living the principles she so clearly explains.”<br />
          <strong>— Roy Eugene Davis, </strong>founder and director of Center
          for Spiritual Awareness and author of Paramahansa Yogananda as I Knew
          Him<br />
          <br />
          “The Jewel of Abundance lays out a well-defined perspective on
          prosperity, wealth, and abundance. It presents a balanced view that
          takes into account common human needs and shows us simple ways to find
          happiness and satisfaction that lie beyond the accumulation of
          material objects. Ellen Grace O’Brian carefully and simply presents
          ancient wisdom so that one can easily begin to make the necessary
          changes to one’s lifestyle. One does not have to be a saint to follow
          the path of righteousness; one simply has to learn the ways of dharma,
          kama, and artha and apply them to one’s daily life. The Jewel of
          Abundance is a very valuable book containing gems of wisdom. It can
          help the world change its course from the present crisis of
          materialism to a sustainable lifestyle.”<br />
          <strong>— Ela Gandhi,</strong> peace activist and founder of the
          Gandhi Development Trust<br />
          <br />
          “A perennial issue for professional yoga teachers and therapists is
          the perceived tension between the need for reasonable material
          prosperity and the desire for spiritual growth. Hence, The Jewel of
          Abundance is a timely, practical, and indeed inspiring guide for
          reconciling these conflicts based on the classic teachings of the
          purusharthas — the four aims of human life — and many other timeless
          lessons from the yoga tradition. As Yogacharya Ellen Grace O’Brian
          says, ‘Prosperity provides the means to fulfill our divine potential;
          it’s the vehicle for the divine dream to manifest.’ She writes
          paragraphs that are jewels in their own right. Thus my advice is to
          read as I did — slowly, to allow the time required to savor and
          reflect on her wisdom. Do her suggested practices. You will find
          yourself refreshed and renewed in both your work and your spirit.”<br />
          <strong>— John Kepner, </strong>MA (Econ), MBA, C-IAYT, executive
          director of the International Association of Yoga Therapists<br />
          <br />
          “Wealth (artha) is a difficult and yet necessary topic for all to
          contemplate, as we live in a world of greed, competition, and
          selfishness motivated by scarcity and desires. Ellen Grace O’Brian has
          dived to the depths of the soul to transform our fears into courage
          and our sense of lack into our joy of abundance. She not only
          enlightens the reader about what true abundance is but also reassures
          the reader that it is reachable step-by-step. The Jewel of Abundance
          is accessible to a vast audience with transparent, graceful, and wise
          words.”<br />
          <strong>— Swami Sitaramananda, </strong>acharya of International
          Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centers<br />
          <br />
          “To live well is to thrive physically, emotionally, intellectually,
          and spiritually. But how? Most self-help books focus on one of these
          factors, often at the expense of the other three. Ellen Grace
          O’Brian’s The Jewel of Abundance recognizes the interdependence of all
          four. That’s because this is not a self-help book, but a Self-help
          book: a manual for liberating the soul that optimizes body, heart,
          mind, and spirit as well. Please don’t read this book. Practice
          it.”<br />

          the Spiritually Independent<br />
          <br />
          “Many of us aspire to purpose, and perhaps even enlightenment, in our
          lifetimes, but few realize that the path leads through prosperity and
          pleasure as equally important steps on the journey. Ellen Grace
          O’Brian’s clear and compelling words bring unique perspective to
          wisdom from ancient teachings, in language that is even more powerful
          today.”<br />

          Networks and cofounder of 1440 Multiversity<br />
          <br />
          “Gaining true prosperity rests upon understanding our karmas and
          fulfilling our dharma, or soul’s purpose. Then we can achieve the
          outer success we need while continuing to progress along our spiritual
          path. In The Jewel of Abundance, Ellen Grace O’Brian provides us with
          the yogic keys to this process of realizing our inner abundance and
          letting it manifest in the world around us.”<br />
          <strong>— Dr. David Frawley (Vamadeva Shastri), </strong>author of
          Yoga and Ayurveda and Shiva: The Lord of Yoga<br />
          <br />
          “Happiness, beauty, and abundance, symbolized by the goddess Lakshmi
          in yogic thought, arise along with Lord Vishnu, who represents wisdom,
          self-control, and detachment. Ellen Grace O’Brian reminds us that our
          outer life must be a mirror of our inner life in order for us to
          achieve our full potential in all that we do.”<br />

          Goddess Within and Yogic Secrets of the Dark Goddess<br />
          <br />
          “The Jewel of Abundance by Yogacharya Ellen Grace O’Brian is an
          excellent template to truly understand the meaning of artha as a tool
          to fulfill your dharma and continue to strive toward moksha. Perfect
          health is the foundation for right action, contentment, and
          nonsensorial happiness. O’Brian offers wonderful yogic tools to help
          you attract abundance and make a difference in your own unique way.
          Read, practice, and enjoy the gifts of human potential.”<br />

          <br />
          “This epiphany-provoking, majestically written book, rich with life
          lessons and ancient wisdom, is a must-read. Every word rings with
          truth — it is a gem to be treasured. I stand in awe of Yogacharya
          O’Brian’s honesty and brilliance as a spiritual teacher and writer.
          The majesty of her prose powerfully yet gently guides humanity along
          an awakened journey toward thriving both materially and spiritually,
          despite crisis and loss or deep-seated patterns of depravity and lack.
          This book imparts truth, courage, inspiration, and hope. I recommend
          it to Vedic, yoga, and Ayurveda students worldwide.”<br />
          <strong>— Acharya Shunya Mathur, </strong>founder and preceptor of
          Vedika Global and author of Ayurveda Lifestyle Wisdom<br />
          <br />
          “You are holding in your hands definitive proof that spirituality and
          prosperity are aligned. Even better, it’s an easy-to-read guidebook
          for letting go of limiting beliefs and the behaviors that are likely
          blocking access to happiness and abundance — what we might call
          ‘spiritual clutter.’ In this book, Ellen Grace O’Brian gives us the
          tools and instructions to set ourselves free and to thrive in this
          fast-paced, unpredictable world. The Jewel of Abundance shows us how
          simple and attainable wealth is, in every form. And the best news is,
          as with every great coming-home story, she reminds us that we were
          born with everything we need to succeed already!”<br />
