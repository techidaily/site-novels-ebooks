          Beautiful Powerful You is a book I couldn't put down. It's raw, honest
          and I could relate to so much. It touched my heart and soul, showing
          me ways to heal and understand parts inside me that were tucked away
          for so many years. Thank you for sharing your journey, and with that
          helping others to heal! <strong>Andrea Pelikan</strong>

          Wow what an amazing read! I loved the poems being on colored pages,
          the pictures were amazing. I love the colorful pages, artwork and
          poetry. They set the tone for each chapter allowing Natasha to openly
          share her personal experiences, uncovering life's journey with the
          addition of many spiritual concepts. Highly recommended, I purchased
          multiple copies as gifts for my friends who have all been enlightened
          after reading this journey too. This book is inspiring and takes pride
          of place on my bookshelf. I can't wait for the sequel now.

        <p>Hi Dear Natasha</p>
        <p>
          I thought before I wrap up the book as a present I might as well read
          it, so everything on hold and I just finished reading it. I love it.
          Thank you Natasha for writing your story. I loved reading it. No pain
          no gain, isn't it? I love the way you wrote it with your own personal
          flair. Your poems are little gems, medicine for the soul. I trust that
          it will help many people finding their heart and soul. No matter what
          your story is (yes, we all have one) there is only one way to do that.
          That's let go and let G.O.D. Love and thanks Natasha. I am looking
          forward to your next book.<strong> Ineke </strong>

          Hello Tash. We have received the book thank you. And I have already
          read it and thoroughly enjoyed every single word you have written. It
          is an amazing book. I can't wait to read the next one.

        <p>Beautiful Powerful You. Journey In - To the Voice of Your Soul</p>
        <p>
          For me this book opened my eyes to what I now know, many people
          experience. A book of openness of what Natasha endured and still does
          today on her personal journey towards a deeper connection to her soul.
          I couldn't help wondering how many little kiddies experience such
          events yet cannot express them, and how this leads them into a world
          of silence. This book opens the pathway for those who have had these
          experiences, to understand there is nothing wrong with them and to
          seek comfort in reaching out to others with similar happenings. I
          watched and listened to a girl as she started reading Natasha's book
          and only a few pages in she revealed to her mother - 'Mum this is me
          'This book, the 1st, I am sure of many, comes highly recommended.
