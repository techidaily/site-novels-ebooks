            >Teachings from the Sirian High Council to help humanity as we merge
            into the 4th dimension</b
          ><br /><br />• Shares empowering insights and revelations from
          six-dimensional Sirian Light Emissaries to help us understand the
          darkness and focus on light for all humanity and the earth<br /><br />•
          Explains what we are undergoing right now around the globe, including
          the rush to merge the human mind with artificial intelligence, ET
          disclosure, and the dark forces that are losing their grip on our
          planet and humanity<br /><br />• Offers Sirian guidance for surviving
          our imminent collective ascension and awakening en masse to new levels
          of conscious awareness<br /><br />In 1996, while visiting the Julia
          Set crop circle in England, Patricia Cori experienced a galactic
          out-of-body journey—a transformational awakening that attuned her to a
          group of interdimensional light beings known to her as the Sirian High
          Council. Serving as their scribe now for more than 25 years, she
          shares the insights and teachings of these sixdimensional Sirian Light
          Emissaries to help humanity as we merge into the fourth dimension and
          face our collective karma—the source of so much of the dramatic events
          now unfolding around the world. <br /><br />Sharing new revelations
          that affirm the veracity of past prophecies as well as transmitting
          new visions for the human race, Cori’s messages from higher realms
          empower readers to peer fearlessly into the darkness, to understand
          it, and to focus on the light for all humankind and the Earth. She
          explains how the Sirians hold us to our responsibility as guardians of
          this planet, with sound direction and advice on how to survive our
          imminent collective ascension and global awakening to new levels of
          conscious awareness. The Sirians’ discussions explain what we are
          undergoing right now and delve into many of the most crucial issues of
          our time, including the rush to merge the human mind with artificial
          intelligence, ET disclosure, cloning, the slipping of time, and the
          dark forces that are losing their grip on our planet and humanity.
          <br /><br />As the struggle between darkness and light is being fought
          at every level, Cori reminds us to take comfort in the fact that the
          Sirian High Council foresaw and told us how this time of immense
          upheaval would be the last phase of our passage out of the darkness
          and into illuminated states of consciousness and toward the light of
          planetary renewal.
