            >Hello From Heaven!</i
          >&nbsp;is the first complete study of an exciting new field of
          research called After-Death Communication, or ADC. This is a spiritual
          experience that occurs when a person is contacted
          <i>directly</i>&nbsp;and <i>spontaneously</i>&nbsp;by a family member
          or friend who has died. During their seven years of research, the
          authors collected more than 3,300 firsthand accounts from people who
          believe they have been contacted by a deceased loved one.<br /><br />The
          353 ADC accounts in <i>Hello From Heaven!</i>&nbsp;offer:<br /><br />•
          Fascinating modern-day evidence of life after death<br />• Comfort and
          emotional support for those who are bereaved<br />• Hope for those who
          yearn to be reunited with a loved one who has died<br />• Courage and
          strength for those who have a life-threatening illness<br />•
          Inspiration for caregivers to the elderly and terminally ill<br />•
          Insight and reassurance for those who are fearful of death<br />•
          Inner peace for those whose hearts and minds are awaiting this good
          news<br /><br />You will treasure these uplifting messages from those
          who continue to exist in a life beyond physical death. Their profound
          communications of love offer comfort, hope, and spiritual inspiration
          to all readers.
