          Exogenesis: the hypothesis that life originated elsewhere in the
          universe and was spread to Earth.<br /><br /><i
            >Exogenesis: Hybrid Humans</i
          >
          offers a deep dive into the strongest ever scientific evidence that
          supports the popular belief that Earth has been visited in prehistory,
          but goes even further, concluding that there is also compelling
          evidence of alien involvement with the human genome. The broader
          history of possible extraterrestrial contact is explored alongside a
          look at current events in the subject of alien disclosure with the
          result of highlighting evidence of a contact continuum that has
          continued since the dawn of humanity. The data brought together
          suggests that the next stage in human evolution may involve the
          manifestation of full open contact with the visitors in our
          lifetimes.<br /><br /><i>Exogenesis: Hybrid Human</i>s explores: An
