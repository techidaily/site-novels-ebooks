              what matters in authentic relationship building and the humanity
              needed to sustain us. Whether you have an audience of 1 or
              100,000, the missing ingredient lies within our ability to expect
              more of ourselves and exhibit a higher level of self-awareness of
              what we need to be better with ourselves and others.</span

              past, confronts his demons, and learns valuable lessons to help
              shape the impact of his life's work. His journey unmasks hidden
              treasures in pain-staking moments that tend to leave a lasting
              impression on the audience that finds themselves craving greater

              goal of inspiring people and organizations to think, to demand and
              expect more of themselves, and to encourage a mindset of lifelong
              learning.</span
