          • Details the nine stages of the ancient Egyptian initiatory path,
          describing each stage’s powers as well as the culminating ceremony
          called “The Crown of Isis” <br /><br />• Provides profound guided
          meditations for each of the nine stages and illustrates the
          manifestation of this path’s principles through stories of awakening
          <br /><br />• Shares the author’s personal journey as a Garment of
          Isis and her own powerful interactions with Isis, which culminated in
          her serving as Oracle of Isis at the Parliament of World Religions in
          Chicago in 1993 <br /><br />The Sacred Science of ancient Egypt was an
          initiatory spiritual system, a technology of consciousness designed to
          birth a mystical communion with the divinities, an embodied union of
          being between the eternal and the mortal. After initiation was
          completed, the re-identified being, now divinely possessed, was known
          as a Garment of Isis, signifying that the goddess Isis dwelt within
          them.<br /><br />Offering a practical guide to the key principles
          within the Egyptian temple tradition, Naomi Ozaniec explores the
          process of creating and developing a personal relationship with the
          Neteru, the divinities and forces of creation of ancient Egypt. She
          details the nine stages of this initiatory path, which are divided
          into three phases--heartmind, spiritmind, and soulmind. This
          step-by-step, interactive process culminates in a ceremony called The
          Crown of Isis. The author provides profound guided meditations and
          illustrates the manifestation of the initiate’s powers through stories
          of awakening brought on by this spiritual path. She also shares her
          personal journey as a Garment of Isis and her own powerful
          interactions with Isis. <br /><br />An accessible yet substantive
          guide to initiation into the Egyptian Mysteries, this book details how
          to gradually awaken and attune your mind to the symbolic, open access
          to higher realms of consciousness, and enter into a mystical marriage
          between personal and divine consciousness.
