          We live in an increasingly "virtual" world in which it can be tempting
          to skip making that true, human connection with someone in pain. Even
          though our thoughts might be with them, we lack the confidence to
          reach out, worrying that we will say or do the "wrong" thing.
          <br /><br />
          In this practical, step-by-step guide to what she calls "the art of
          comforting," Val Walker draws on numerous interviews with "Master
          Comforters" to guide readers in gently and gracefully breaking through
          the walls that those who are suffering often erect around themselves.
          Interviewees include inspiring individuals such as Alicia Rasin, who,
          as a victim's advocate for the city of Richmond, Virginia, has devoted
          her life to comforting grieving families devastated by homicide, gang
          violence, and other traumatic experiences; or Patricia Ellen, who, as
          a grief counselor and outreach director at the Center for Grieving
          Children in Portland, Maine, appears on site to support and comfort
          children, staff, and parents when a school is facing a death,
          violence, or other crises. <br /><br />
          All of us will, at one time or the other, be called upon to offer
          warmth and support to another human being who is suffering-this book
          will show you how to answer the call with an open heart.

          "In <b>The Art of Comforting</b>, Val Walker points to a great irony
          in our society today: as hyper-'connected' as we are, deep down, many
          of us fear that we lack the ability to effectively comfort another
          human being. This wise and inspiring book provides a step-by-step
          guide to sitting down and establishing a human-to-human connection,
          even in the most difficult or chaotic situations."<br /><b
            >--Greg Mortenson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
            <i>Three Cups of Tea</i></b
          ><br /><br />"<b>The Art of Comforting</b> is must reading for
          everyone...The message is instantly applicable as well as enormously
          comforting."<br /><b
            >--Christiane Northrup, M.D., New York Times bestselling author of
            <i>Mother- Daughter Wisdom, The Wisdom of Menopause</i>, and
            <i>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</i></b
          ><br /><br />"With clarity, compassion and wisdom, Walker teaches the
          art and the craft of comforting others and ourselves. In today's
          distressed and frenetic world, she does us all a great favor. This
          fine book is a resource for all those who want to be able to help
          friends, family members and other people who are in need of our
          kindness."<br /><b
            >--Mary Pipher, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
            <i>Reviving Ophelia</i>, and <i>The Shelter of Each Other</i></b
          ><br /><br />"In an effort to write the book she couldn't herself
          find, rehabilitation counselor Walker discusses the nature of
          comforting and illustrates how to restore this most important skill.
          Her message comes not only from experience, but from others in the
          grief/trauma counseling field, in this guidebook that rings true and
          pulls the reader in for more. Recommended for all interested
          adults."<br /><b>-<i>-Library Journal </i></b>
