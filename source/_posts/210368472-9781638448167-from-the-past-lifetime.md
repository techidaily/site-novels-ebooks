            Hello, my name is Xuan Nguyen. IaEUR(tm)m the author of this book,
            From the Past Lifetime. This is a collection of the real exciting
            short stories about some of my premonitions, hunches, as well as
            predictions, since I was a young kid about three years old to when I
            was an adult about twenty-nine to thirty years old.Since I was a
            baby, there were already some strange things surrounding me. Back in
            those days, my grandpa and my mom used to put me in a big plastic
            bowl every day and taking the shower for me. But whataEUR(tm)s so
            strange is that if any day I didnaEUR(tm)t take a shower, then I got
            sick right that day! Another strange thing is that after taking the
            shower, if anytime they tried to dress me and if I stare at that
            pair of clothes, then I would get sick the next day if they put that
            clothes on me!When I turned three years old, one of my favorite
            aunts at the time suddenly vanished. Then I tried to find her anyway
            I could, but in my young mind and feelings, I already knew something
            had happened. Then I told my grandpa and my mom that my aunt would
            never come back. And it turned out to be so true that my aunt had
            escaped the ocean and drifted to another land to live forever, never
            coming back! Besides that, I have some other premonitions and
            hunches such as about the two thieves who came and stole everything
            in my house at night. Some other premonitions and predictions I have
            had such as about Leonardo DiCaprio and his successful nose about
            the tsunami in Indonesia, about the founder of Walmart, Sam Walton,
            and many other premonitions and predictions that have happened for
            real in my life.
