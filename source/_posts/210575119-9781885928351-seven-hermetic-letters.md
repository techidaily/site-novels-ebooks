          <p>
            In the appendix to the first edition of Franz Bardon’s novelized
            autobiography, Frabato the Magician, the reader will find excerpts
            from Dr. Georg Lomer’s work, now embodied in this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time it was not known to the publisher that the material
            published under the title of “High Magic” was in fact the work of
            Dr. Lomer. The manuscripts included no reference to this author, and
            though his name was contained in the Czech translation, this was not
            known to the original German publisher until recently. It is,
            however, important to note that Franz Bardon considered Dr. Lomer’s
            instructions to be of great value, otherwise he would not have had
            them translated into Czech for the benefit of his students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Lomer’s Seven Hermetic Letters belong, without a doubt, among
            the most valuable magical treatises of the 20th century, providing
            incredible insight into one’s spirit- and astral-nature. The
            original title contained the words “secret science,” which, since
            the publication of the Bardon books, have lost their earlier
            significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are aware that many students do not adhere strictly to the
            instructions of the masters, and do their exercises aimlessly
            without giving any serious thought to the consequences. Dr. Lomer
            recommends exercises whereby the consciousness is transferred into
            the feet and other parts of the body. For those who have reached the
            “magical equilibrium” in accordance with the instructions given in
            Bardon’s Initiation into Hermetics, these exercises are not harmful.
            Without this magical equilibrium, however, the student subjects
            himself to certain dangers, concerning which Bardon warns us in The
            Key to the True Kabbalah, pp. 55-58 (1996 edition).
          </p>
          <p>
            In these days, self-cognition is not much in demand; that is why the
            strictness of Dr. Lomer’s instructions may touch some readers
            unpleasantly. But he who has the strong wish for spiritual
            perfection or simply theoretical knowledge will not be discouraged.
            The exercises of spiritual, astral, and physical asceticism are
            intended to serve a higher purpose, rather than one’s own selfish
            desires.
