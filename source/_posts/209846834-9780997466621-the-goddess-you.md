          <p><strong>The Goddess You, is indeed you.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>You, my friend, are perfection in every single way.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;You’ve just lost the view, and your connection to your groovy
            Goddess Self.
          </p>
          <p>
            This lovely book you hold in your hands right now is about leaving
            no stone unturned in your life. Or perhaps more than that, no part
            of your life that Divine love does not heal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your journey in this life has lessons, challenges and experiences
            that can distance you from the truth, which is that you are and
            always have been a Divine being, a Goddess with a purpose.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            “Perhaps now you crave for change. Heed that craving. That craving
            is what helps you admit that you are not living fully in your soul
            alignment. Thus begins your search, the search to find who you are
            why your are here, what your gifts and talents are and where to find
            the balance you seek. The “when” comes at the very moment you say,
            “yes, I am ready”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finding peace and balance in life is something most of us yearn for.
            Feeling disconnected and sadden by the woman she had become, Jeanne
            Street cried out for help. Her prayers were answered in the form of
            Angelic messages. Quiet at first, but as she listened, the voice
            became louder and stronger until the message became vividly clear.
            The 12 principles that you will find inside the pages of this book
            were written from Spirits guidance, first as a message to heal
            Street’s life and reconnect with her Goddess Soul-Self. Now the
            channeled guidance is here in the form of this book to help you find
            the peace, balance and connection that you have been seeking.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            “ Living in soul alignment is not a race or show of skills, but
            rather a way of life; so when you are ready,you can align.”
          </p>
          <p>“Soul alignment is the destination.”</p>
          <p>
            “Each time you put the principles into practice your life will shift
            and change into a more fulfilling easy to embrace state of being.”
          </p>
          <p>“Get your Inner Goddess groove on.”</p>
          <p>“You can do this, your Goddess Soul Self is counting on it.”</p>
