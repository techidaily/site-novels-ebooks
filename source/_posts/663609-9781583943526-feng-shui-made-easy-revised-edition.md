            >Credited as bringing feng shui to the Western mainstream, this
            influential classic offers a uniquely holistic approach to feng
            shui—one focused on initiating change from the inside
            <i>and</i> out.<br /></b
          ><br />
          <b
            >Discover the foundational principles of the ancient Chinese
            practice of feng shui—and how you can apply them to your
            relationships, community, and home—with “the most user-friendly
            translation of feng shui” (<i>The New York Times</i>).<br /></b
          ><br />
          While most of the early English-language books on feng shui are
          dauntingly mystical or rely on complex calculations or culturally
          specific design practices, <i>Feng Shui Made Easy</i> takes a more
          holistic approach, clearly explaining the fundamentals while guiding
          readers on an inner journey of understanding.<br /><br />
          Thoughtfully written and beautifully illustrated, the book is
          structured around an “architecture of consciousness” that is really
          the inner landscape. The book explores each “house” of the bagua—the
          chart representing one’s journey through life; relationships with
          parents, loved ones, and community; creativity; spirituality; and
          connectedness to the source of life—and the symbolism of the
          corresponding <i>I Ching</i> trigram. <i>Feng Shui Made Easy</i> helps
          readers discover the nature of these connections, as well as learn
          what obstructions must be removed to change fixed patterns of behavior
          and restore balance, harmony, and inner peace—a process that, when
          combined with external adjustments, results in increased success and
          lasting change in all areas of life.<br /><br />
          This revised edition expands on the author’s intuitive approach with
          new sections on health, children’s environments, and ecological
          concerns and sustainable practices. The author also corrects
          misconceptions about feng shui and uses fascinating case studies to
          share valuable insights he gained from interactions with his clients
          and readers.

          “The most user-friendly translation of feng shui for American
          audiences.” <br />
          —<i>The New York Times<br /><br /></i>“We are shaped by spaces of our
          lives and, in a time of information overload, the need to create
          moments of solitude and peace are even more vital than ever before.
          This guide explains the Feng Shui philosophy and shows you how to
          define your environment and the surroundings you wish to live in. In a
          time of great change there is a great desire to create harmony within
          one’s personal space. William Spear takes you into a deeper knowledge
          of Feng Shui and how it can influence your surroundings.”<br />
          —Cameron Sinclair, cofounder and CEO (Chief Eternal Optimist) of
          Architecture for Humanity, 2006 TED prize recipient and coeditor of

            Humanitarian Crises<br /></i
          ><br />
          “My family and I have benefited greatly from our relationship with
          William Spear over many years. Shortly after my first feng shui
          consultation with him, I won my first Grammy! In this book, he shares
          the same great resources for all creative spirits who love the
          earth.”<br />
          —Paul Winter, four-time Grammy®&nbsp;Award–winning composer and
          musician<br /><br />“William Spear has put together a book that is
          user-friendly, while still respecting the deeper aspects and
          implications of a profound science.… <i>Feng Shui Made Easy </i>gives
          not just practical suggestions for analyzing and altering your
          environment, but teaches intuitive feng shui, so that you can learn to
          trust your feelings about your surroundings.”<br />—<i
            >Yoga Journal<br /></i
          ><br />
          “For the past twenty years, William Spear has been my “go to” person
          for all properties that needed fixing before they could sell. He’s a
          sensitive genius who knows how to right wrongs and produce a
          wonderfully inviting, very saleable home. His book has been invaluable
          and something that I frequently have gifted to my clients. After
          having used William to consult successfully on my clients’ hard to
          sell properties, I’ve gotten into the habit of never buying or
          renovating a home of my own without his advice—even when I had to fly
          him across the country to do so!<br />
          William is not only a great Feng Shui Master, he is a wonderful
          teacher, and his book brings home the principles of this ancient art
          to those who are unable to consult with him personally. His book
          enables the consumer to understand and rectify many issues
          themselves.”<br />
          —Patricia Warburg Cliff, Senior Vice President and Director of
          International Sales, the Corcoran Group real estate company<br /><br /><i
            >“</i
          >In his book, [William Spear] takes the view that the art of placement
          is governed both by external laws but also can be generated from a
          clean, inner condition of the body.&nbsp;When we eat whole,
          unprocessed foods, we tend to make better decisions… guided by our
          intuition… [Spear’s] take on Feng Shui made perfect, and refreshingly
          satisfying sense.”<br />
          —<i>Jessica Porter’s Hip Chick’s Blog<br /><br /></i>“<i

            Placement</i
          >
          by William Spear takes the reader on a journey into the vast world of
          the Feng Shui. … [The book] is loaded with facts, history, and real
          life ways to make Feng Shui a part of your world, both inside and out.
          … This never boring or dry book takes a somewhat in depth look into
          what Feng Shui is really about as Spears reminds us to consider the
          relationships that exist in our environments, both inside and outside.
          … In <i>Feng Shui Made Easy</i> the title really says it all. This is
          a hands-on book loaded with enlightening, engaging exercises that
          allow the reader to really get a hands on, minds on comprehension of
