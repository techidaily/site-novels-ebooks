            >A comprehensive presentation of group-oriented rites for modern
            magicians inspired by the occult works of Aleister Crowley.</b
          ><br /><br />Group ritual has been a cornerstone of spiritual practice
          since time immemorial, yet its history and importance have often been
          overlooked by occultists of the modern age. This book is an essential
          resource on the topic, featuring rituals written by Aleister Crowley
          for his own magic circles—many of them unpublished during his
          lifetime, plus rare ancient texts that were Crowley’s own
          inspiration.<br /><br />The rituals are newly edited and explained by
          practicing magician Rodney Orpheus, drawing on his wealth of
          experience performing and teaching them within Crowley’s magical
          order, Ordo Templi Orientis. Orpheus introduces each ritual,
          explaining its historical context and its function and mode of
          operation. He also includes detailed notes on each ritual’s proper
          setting and performance.<br /><br />Whether absolute beginner or
          seasoned expert, magicians of all paths will find this volume to be an
          eminently workable and extremely powerful grimoire spanning centuries
          from ancient Mithraic and Bacchanalian rites, Goetia, and Gnosticism,
          right up to present day Crowleyan invocations and sexual magick.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Rodney Orpheus is a practicing magician, an established musician, and
          a member of the band The Cassandra Complex, one of the most important
          electroindustrial bands of the past decade. He lives in London and
          travels extensively. &nbsp; Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) was the most
          widely read author in 20th-century occultism. He single-handedly
          redefined magic as a field of inquiry and endeavor through his books
          and the order that he led--the A.A. and the O.T.O. He is the author
          several books including The Book of the Law, 777 &amp; Other
          Qabalistic Writings, and The Book of Thoth. &nbsp; Lon Milo DuQuette
          has been involved with occult studies since the late 60s, and has
          become an acknowledged and widely recognized authority within the
          world of modern occultism. His previous publications include Magick of
          Thelema, The Tarot of Ceremonial Magick, Angels, Demons &amp; Gods of
          the New Millennium, and the humorous, biographical My Life with the
          Spirits.
