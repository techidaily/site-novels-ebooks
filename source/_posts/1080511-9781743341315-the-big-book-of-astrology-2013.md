        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Kelli was first drawn to astrology during her childhood in Sydney,
          Australia. As early as eight years of age, she began recording birth
          dates and sun signs for anyone willing to share. Kelli's formal
          astrological studies began at the College of Humanistic Astrology.<br /><br /><br /><br />This
          led to her professional accreditation with multiple organizations
          including: CA NCGR IV (National Council for Geocosmic Research), PMAFA
          (Professional Member of the American Federation of Astrologers), ISAR
          C.A.P. (International Society for Astrological Research), and the FAA
          (Federation of Australian Astrologers).<br /><br /><br /><br />Kelli
          views astrology as a universal language through which the unique
          elements that make each of us who we are can be discussed, understood
          and developed. For Kelli, astrology is certainly not just about
          entertainment, but that doesn't mean it has to be dry and academic
          either. She sees her role as bringing this ancient science to our
          modern day life through current technologies â€” from Web sites to
          mobile phones and video screens.
