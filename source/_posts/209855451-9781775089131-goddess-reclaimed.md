            Awaken your inner Goddess by embarking on a transformational journey
            with international Sacred Feminine coach, healer, and #1 bestselling
            author, Syma Kharal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you are new to Goddess spirituality or deeply immersed on
            your path, this book will help you (and every woman regardless of
            her spirituality) resurrect and unapologetically own your innate
            shakti—your Divine Feminine power—so that you may heal, rise, and
            flourish in every way.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you meet fourteen archetypal Goddesses along your magical
            journey, each one will reignite the ancient feminine wisdom, power,
            and gifts that have always been within you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through each progressive gateway, Syma shares inspiring
            interpretations of the myths and attributes of each Goddess to help
            you reconnect with her nature within yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            She then leads you through deeply powerful initiations using guided
            meditations and rituals to help you embody the essence of each
            Goddess. Syma also provides practical guidance to help you apply the
            teachings of each Goddess in your daily life.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter where you are when you begin, this alchemical journey will
            empower you to release negative, self-sabotaging patterns and
            embrace the divine love, joy, pleasure, abundance, success, and
            fulfillment you were born for. By the end, you will take your seat
            upon your throne as the Sovereign Queen of your domain and as a
            beautiful feminine leader in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world needs you and all women—now more than ever—to shine in
            your full Goddess glory. It is time.
          </p>
