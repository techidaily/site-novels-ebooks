          One woman’s mystical path through grief into renewal, expanded
          awareness, and discovery of her own healing capabilities <br />
          <br />• Offers a lens into a wide variety of wisdomkeeping traditions
          and alternative healing paradigms throughout the Americas and Europe
          <br />
          <br />• Shows how the mystical path enables us to find renewal in
          times of profound loss <br />
          <br />• Details the author’s awakening to the energies of the cosmos,
          which can guide us toward our destiny, balanced between our soul’s
          dark and light energies <br />
          <br />How do you find renewal after loss, especially the loss of a
          child? How do you find purpose and courage when loss is your constant
          teacher? <br />
          <br />After weeks of profound grief following the loss of her young
          daughter, Sandra Corcoran found herself inexplicably at a
          life-changing workshop on indigenous teachings and energy healing.
          With the first glimpse of the light that called her to the workshop,
          Corcoran found herself beginning a 30-year metaphysical journey
          within, initially to heal her grief but eventually leading her from
          the darkness into the light of her own soul’s evolution. <br />
          <br />Working with Native elders and indigenous wisdomkeepers
          throughout North, Central, and South America, Corcoran opened her
          heart to the immensity of the living energies of the cosmos and
          discovered her shamanistic gifts as an intuitive counselor, dreamtime
          decoder, and facilitator for others’ self-healing. As she learned to
          discern these living energies and work with them, she also discovered
          the middle path between the soul’s dark and luminous energies,
          striking the balance that allows us to fulfill our destiny. <br />
          <br />Sharing the core teachings of her many indigenous and esoteric
          mentors, including lessons in synchronicity, metaphysics, the
          extraordinary power of the heart, multi-dimensional realms, and energy
          healing, Corcoran leads readers on an adventure across continents
          through birth, death, ceremony, and ritual to renewal and the
          frontiers of expanded consciousness. She shows that no matter how far
          outside of the familiar we are led, we are guided back to ourselves
          and offered another opportunity to embrace our world and, ultimately,
          find our place in it.

          “Sandra Corcoran has written a remarkable account of her studies and
          practice of shamanic counseling. I have had personal contact with two
          of her teachers, Twylah Nitsch and Oh Shinnah, and she couldn’t have
          found better guides.

          is filled with fantastic stories into the nonordinary realms, but
          recent investigation of dreams and other altered states of
          consciousness lend credibility to her accounts. The author’s work is
          rooted in indigenous traditions and rituals that contain the wisdom
          and insight so badly needed to help the torn culture of our time.”
