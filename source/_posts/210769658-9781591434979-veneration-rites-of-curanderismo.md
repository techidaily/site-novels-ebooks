            >A guide to connecting with your ancestors and healing your
            lineage</b
          ><br /><br />• Shares traditional veneration rites and practices to
          connect with your ancestors, including limpia rites, trance journeys,
          energy work, and sacred gardening<br /><br />• Explores ancestral
          altar-making practices, sacred tools for altars, and how to invite
          your ancestors to take an active role in intervening on your behalf<br /><br />•
          Describes the deification process of esteemed ancestors and how this
          opens access to special powers for those sharing that ancestor’s
          lineage<br /><br />Exploring the diverse and dynamic ancestral
          veneration rites of the ancient Mesoamericans as well as those
          practiced in contemporary curanderismo, Erika Buenaflor shows how we
          can draw from these traditions to reconnect with our ancestors, deepen
          our healing journeys, and shape our lives. She explains how ancestors
          contain sacred energy that can continue in their direct physical
          heirs, be reborn in the landscape at sacred sites, or manifest in
          other beings that inhabit the same lands. She describes the
          deification process for esteemed ancestors and how this opens access
          to special powers for those sharing that ancestor’s lineage.
          <br /><br />Buenaflor examines the ancient sacred offerings and
          ceremonies used to ensure ancestral aid, guidance, and intervention as
          well as the ancestors’ well-being and comfort in the afterlife.
          Bringing the knowledge into the present day, she shares numerous
          veneration rites and healing practices to strengthen your bonds with
          your ancestors, including limpia rites, ritual craft-making, trance
          journeys, shamanic breathwork, energy work with past and present
          lives, sacred gardening, and ancestral altar-making. She introduces
          you to Nepantla spirituality, the path of reclaiming sacred liminal
          space, and shows how you can heal your ancestral lineage and reclaim
          your esteemed ancestors, those who anchor you with a feeling of
          belonging to something greater, divine, and beautiful.
          <br /><br />Whether you are able to create a long and detailed family
          tree or have no knowledge of your grandparents or even parents, this
          book offers many ways to connect with your spiritual forebearers, heal
          your lineage, and receive spiritual aid as you reclaim your ancestors
          and welcome them into your life.

          which were taught to her by elders and curanderx, but also from
          extensive study, are antidotes to the various physical, mental,
          emotional, cultural, and spiritual ailments we’ve endured for over
          five hundred years.”
