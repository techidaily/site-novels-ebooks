          As a writer, I know that words are important at the beginning of any
          creative process; they become the tools used to convey ideas—to paint
          a picture that holds relevance and meaning to the reader and hopefully
          finds a home in their heart. Between the covers of this book are many
          words which are intended to offer you encouragement, irrespective of
          who you are or where you are on this sometimes challenging, sometimes
          confusing, sometimes exhilarating journey we call life.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          My personal vision is “Guiding People to Purpose.” It is my belief
          that we each have a purpose for being on this planet or we would not
          be here; we all matter. In this book you will find a compilation of
          articles I have been privileged to write for
          <i>Science of Mind</i> magazine, as well as a number of essays I have
          written as blogs over the years. As you read these articles and
          essays, may you be open to receiving the love and respect intended in
          each one. The content of this book is innately spiritual, and meant to
          be so, because that is what you are—a spiritual being having a human
          experience. When it is time for you to return to the place of your
          spiritual origin you will be asked two questions: Did you learn to
          love well . . . and, is the planet a better place today than it was
          the day you arrived because you were there? As you read this book, may
          the answer to these questions become a litmus test for the balance of
          your life that encourages you to live an exquisite, fulfilling life.
          Know that who you are and—equally important—what you do with who you
          are, matter.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Throughout his lifetime, Dennis Merritt Jones has been on a quest to
          inspire and lift people to a higher expression of life. His personal
          vision is to guide people to their purpose, knowing that when we fully
          awaken to who we are and why we are on the planet, we begin to
          naturally share our gift with humankind, and in the process, create an
          enriching life for ourselves and the world around us. Dennis has been
          a Science of Mind minister since 1985 and received his Doctorate of
          Divinity in 1996.<br /><br />
          Dennis is the author of the award-winning books,
          <i
            >The Art of Uncertainty: How to Live in the Mystery of Life and Love
            It</i
          >
          and
          <i>The Art of Being: 101 Ways to Practice Purpose in Your Life,</i> as
          well as
          <i>Your (Re)Defining Moments: Becoming Who You Were Born to Be,</i>
          all released by Tarcher/Penguin publishing. In addition he is the
          author of <i>How to Speak Science of Mind,</i> published by DeVorss
          and Company. Look for his latest book,
          <i>The Art of Abundance: Ten Rules for a Prosperous Life,</i> to be
          released by TarcherPerigee/Penguin Random House Publishing in 2018.
          Dennis is a columnist for the <i>Huffington Post</i> and the
          <i>Science of Mind</i> magazine, as well as various print media. He is
          also proud to serve as a consultant and spiritual mentor to
          organizations and individuals in many parts of the world.<br /><br />
          Dennis believes we each have the capacity, and ultimately, the
          responsibility to contribute something positive to this world, leaving
          it a better place than it was when we arrived—concepts reflected in
          his writings and seminars. He uses his understanding of universal
          principles to draw upon wisdom from both Eastern and Western
          philosophies. Dennis believes that the consciousness of unity,
          cooperation, and reverence for life on the planet will be one of the
          most significant influences upon society as we approach the challenges
          and uncertainties of twenty-first-century living.
