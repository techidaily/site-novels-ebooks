          A step-by-step guide to working with the spirits of ancient northern
          Europe <br />
          <br />• Explains how to build relationships with Earth, Sun, Moon,
          Plants, Animals, Water, Fire, Craft, Air, and the Ancestors through 83
          practical exercises <br />
          <br />• Explores the role of altered states in spirit work <br />
          <br />• Outlines the ancient cultural rules and taboos to avoid
          spiritual debt or offense <br />
          <br />We are all surrounded by spirits. Many people feel called to
          work with them, but few know where to begin. Enjoined by the gods and
          spirits to fulfill this need, Raven Kaldera and Galina Krasskova have
          reconstructed the indigenous spiritual traditions of northern Europe
          and Scandinavia extinguished more than one thousand years ago by the
          spread of Christianity. Arising from basic survival needs, these
          practical traditions are fundamentally tied to the elements found in
          the harsh world of the ancient North. <br />
          <br />Beginning with the skills tied to the Earth element, necessary
          for grounding prior to the more demanding aspects of the
          practice--working with Sun, Moon, Plants, Animals, Water, Fire, Craft,
          and Air--the authors explain, step by step, how to build relationships
          with each elemental spirit and the Ancestors. Offering 83 practical
          exercises, from cleansing with the Moon or borrowing the legs of
          Reindeer to making sacred space with Mugwort or creating an ancestor
          altar, they also explore building spirit relationships through altered
          states. Emphasizing the proper management of your spirit relationships
          to avoid spiritual debt or offense, the authors outline the ancient
          cultural rules and taboos that circumscribe these practices, essential
          knowledge for successful and fruitful spirit alliances. <br />
          <br />Detailing the beginning set of skills needed to work with the
          spirits of this ancient world, this comprehensive workbook offers a
          unique ancestral spiritual outlet for those of northern European
          descent as well as an accessible guide for anyone trying to fulfill
          their shamanic callings.

          “Our modern world is hungry for Spirit, and this hunger leads to some
          dark places if it isn’t met by Spirit. The shaman’s path is the
          strongest means we have of addressing this hunger in a meaningful way.
          Kaldera and Krasskova offer a grand mix of tradition, magic, and
          reconstruction in service to a broad community. Those with a genetic,
          cultural, or spiritual link with northern European culture will find
          this book especially satisfying.”
