        </h4>
        <p>
          Gelong Thubten is a Buddhist monk, meditation teacher and author. He
          was educated at Oxford University, and became an actor in London and
          New York. At the age of 21 he suffered from severe burnout and a
          life-threatening heart problem. This dramatic wake-up call led him to
          join Samye Ling Tibetan Buddhist Monastery in Scotland, where he
          became a monk. His training over the past 25 years has included
          spending over six years in intensive meditation retreats, the longest
          of which lasted four years, and he has studied under some of the
          greatest Tibetan meditation masters. He is regarded as a highly
          influential thought-leader, teaching meditation internationally in the
          fields of charity, education, healthcare and business.
