        <p>
          Ms. Rosetree's latest book is an effective how-to manual for
          successfully decluttering your aura, your space and your psyche of
          five common types of astral debris while protecting yourself from
          psychic attacks.These include astral ties, negative thought forms,
          psychic coercion, ghosts, and as a bonus for those who are seriously
          engaged in personal growth and transformation, how to give yourself an
          energy makeover.With Ms. Rosetree's expert and entertaining tutelage,
          you will gain practical understandings and skills in freeing yourself
          from a lot of unnecessary suffering while keeping yourself clear and
          able to move forward in life.It is written in straightforward style,
          filled with humor and honesty, clearly and sensibly explaining the
          differences between the spiritual, astral, and physical realms of
          existence. In the first chapter she breaks down the five simple tools
          everyone needs and already owns to clean and protect themselves from
          all manner of astral goop.Unlike many other systems I've studied, this
          one does not require long-term working to develop the ability to
          channel light or create elaborate healing structures.There's nothing
          to burn or spray, no crystals or salts, no complex prayers or
          rituals.Rose explains the five tools you need are already within you,
          waiting to be put into effective action. In this system you need to
          use your awareness and your breath and Rose teaches you how, with
          simple exercises that bring fast results. -- Midwest Book
          ReviewRosetree's diction is peppery and crisp; she talks about
          energetic decluttering and recommends having a spiritual skill set
          manufactured directly by God. She presents the reader with five
          techniques for metaphysical purification and names them Spiritual
          Cleansing Products. She adds that consciousness is the ultimate
          bountiful cleaner-upper and recommends Energy Healing Hygiene. This
          book could be quite useful to aficionados of the intuitional arts, to
          those who want to get more out of their experience here in Earth
          School, and to readers interested in a retrospective written by
          someone who's had a fascinating career and who delivers the goods in a
          generous and chatty way. --Fearless Book Reviews
