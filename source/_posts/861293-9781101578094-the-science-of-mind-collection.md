          ><br /><br />
          This book contains the fundamentals of Ernest Holmes's teachings and
          is a primary resource used by teaching centers and spiritual healers
          worldwide. Its universal principles apply to people of all spiritual
          backgrounds as they describe a higher level of existence attainable
          through the use of Nature's forces and the power of God. While
          imparting an unrivaled technique for living, Dr. Holmes's classic
          guide speaks clearly to a complex world caught in transition and
          searching for guidance.<br /><b> &nbsp;</b><br />
          <b><i>This Thing Called You</i></b
          ><br /><b> &nbsp;</b><br />
          One of Ernest Holmes’s cornerstone works,
          <i>This Thing Called You</i> is an intimate guide through which
          readers learn the important lesson of how they are an immutable part
          of the flow of life, and how they may fulfill the longing, within all
          of us, to live more fully.<br /><br />
          The book details methods of meditation used for healing, improving
          mind and body, and reaching one’s divine self. Included are numerous
          inspirations, meditations, and prayers that individuals can apply to
          their lives, which reveal the unlimited potential of the spiritual
          psychology that Holmes founded.<br />

          <b><i>Questions and Answers on the Science of Mind</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          Ernest Holmes's Science of Mind philosophy has reached millions of

          used as a guidebook, it contains spiritual answers to more than three
          hundred of life's most important and puzzling questions on topics such
          as:<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          * how to deal with specific health challenges;<br />
          * what to do when experiencing a lack of finances;<br />

          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          <b><i>A New Design for Living</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          <i
            >Nothing lies beyond the scope of your ability. The new design for
            living you create has no limitations. Literally all the good things
            that life and the world offer are yours to have and enjoy. But you
            need to recognize them, accept them, and incorporate them into the
            new design you are now going to create.&nbsp;</i
          ><br /><br />
          In its scope, and in its effect on readers,&nbsp;<i
            >A New Design for Living</i
          >&nbsp;is second only to Ernest Holmes's magnum opus,&nbsp;<i
            >The Science of Mind</i
          >. In this cherished spiritual classic, Holmes demonstrates that
          wishes-from health, love, and friendship to the career and home of
          your dreams-are not only possible to realize but are within each
          person's very reach.<br /><br />
          At last available again, this galvanizing book teaches how to turn
          mind-power into an infinitely positive force-the very force of
          creation itself. Harmonize with the beauty and intelligence of the
          universe, watch the magnificence of life transform before you, and
          awaken to the nature of reality. With this newfound power of
          transformative thinking, every goal is attainable.
