            <strong>RISE UP! Poems of Protest, Poems of Praise</strong> Is a
            poetry collection of powerful <strong>imagery</strong> braided
            together from the <strong>poems</strong> of a
            <strong
              >grandfather born to parents who were slaves and his
              granddaughter</strong
            >, who have linked the travesties of
            <strong>racism and slavery</strong> , and the devastation and waste
            of <strong>war</strong>, with <strong>hope</strong>, grace, and
            <strong>peace</strong>.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The underlying themes of the beauty and awe of creation, the wonders
            of nature and stars,&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            and mankind's sense of place and belonging are spun throughout the
            book.
          </p>
          <p>
            The insights of each poem reflects the rich
            <strong>legacy</strong> of this
            <strong>African American family</strong>, and how their writing
            creates a connection to other generations. North Carolina Poet
            Laureate <strong>Jaki Shelton Green</strong> states, "These poems
            are emblematic of the reality that many things that cause strife and
            sorrow are also the things that cause an uprising in the spirit. The
            pages of RISE UP! Poems of Protest, Poems of Praise is a
            metaphorical offering of a wellspring of
            <strong>solidarity</strong> that our world needs. These pages help
            us drink fully of the possibilities of laughter knowing that weeping
            dehydrates the body; reminding us that we are the water bearers of
            hope."
          </p>
          <p>
            This book also speaks to other people who, in their
            <strong>Christian</strong> walks have been summoned to give more
            than a nod to the injustices of the past, but urged to acknowledge,
            and recognize their responsibility to help solve issues of
            <strong>social injustice boldly</strong> through
            <strong>Christ's love</strong>.

          The poems in Rise Up! Poems of Protest, Poems of Praise speak wisely
          to our time and ask us to
        </p>
        <p>
          attend with eyes and hearts wide open, to hear two voices from two
          generations plead for justice,
        </p>

          truth, faith, and beauty.-Suzanne Underwood Rhodes, Arkansas Poet

          RISE UP! Poems of Protest, Poems of Peace by Andrew Wilbert Fitz and
          Mari Fitz-Wynn offers
        </p>
        <p>
          a loving and sobering guide for the Christian pilgrimage. Clearly it
          addresses issues of racism
        </p>
        <p>
          and slavery, but the insights in these poems go much further because
          they rest on a strong faith
        </p>
        <p>
          in our triune God "who made of one blood all nations of men". Long
          before modern science
        </p>
        <p>
          discovered this, the Bible told us truthfully that men of all nations,
          skin colors, are made of one
        </p>
        <p>blood.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          These poems collectively woo the heart to aspire higher, the mind to
          go deeper, the soul to be
        </p>
        <p>
          transparent and confess, while encouraging strength to persevere in
          loving our neighbors as
        </p>
        <p>
          ourselves. I will buy multiple copies to share with friends and family
          but will also keep a copy at
        </p>
        <p>
          my bedside. This is not a read-once and put-back-on-the-shelf book.
          RISE UP! is a needed
        </p>
        <p>
          companion and treasured resource to help refine our Christian walks.

          Deep calls to deep between Andrew Fitz and his granddaughter, Mari
          Fitz Wynn. Their poems
        </p>
        <p>
          echo and magnify one another as mighty lions roaring to each other in
          the night. This rich
        </p>
        <p>
          treasury captures the call for justice heard from Moses, Joshua's
          courage to act, and King

        <p>David's craft of connecting words to the cries of the soul.</p>
