          A visual tour of the evidence for ancient astronauts in Mesoamerica<br /><br />•
          Includes more than 200 full-color photographs from the author’s
          personal archives<br /><br />• Details the astronaut
          technology--helmets, tanks, hoses, keyboards, rockets--clearly
          illustrated in stone carvings and statues from Mesoamerican sites such
          as Palenque, Chichén Itzá, and Teotihuacán in Mexico and Tikal in
          Guatemala <br /><br />• Explores the similarities of Maya pyramids
          with those at Kanchipuram in South India<br /><br />Sharing more than
          200 never-before-published full-color photographs from his personal
          archives, bestselling author Erich von Däniken provides clear evidence
          of ancient alien contact and technology among the archaeological sites
          of the Maya as well as other ancient cultures, such as the Aztecs and
          the Hindus. He reveals how the “gods” immortalized in Maya sculptures,
          carved reliefs, and myth were not supernatural beings but
          technologically advanced visitors, astronauts who gifted the Maya with
          their sophisticated understanding of calendar time and cosmology. He
          explains how, with no explanation for their technologies and origins,
          the Maya interpreted the visitors as divine and, thus, the “gods” were
          born.<br /><br />Examining stone carvings and statues from many
          Mesoamerican sites such as Palenque, Chichén Itzá, and Teotihuacán in
          Mexico and Tikal in Guatemala, von Däniken reveals the astronaut
          technology--helmets, tanks, hoses, keyboards, rockets--clearly
          illustrated in these ancient depictions of the gods. He explores the
          similarities of Plato’s writings with the Chilam Balam books of Mexico
          and compares “ancient alien” features in myths around the world,
          paralleling how mercury is mentioned as a fuel ingredient of flying
          machines in ancient India with the discovery of mercury at Copán,
          Palenque, and Teotihuacán as well as in the grave of a Chinese emperor
          and two Egyptian graves on Nabta Playa. Illustrating the similarities
          of Mayan step pyramids with those of Kanchipuram in South India, the
          author explains how Mayan pyramids are crowned with a small temple,
          residence, or landing field of the gods, while the pyramids of South
          India are topped with a <i>Vimana</i>, a “godly” flying vehicle.<br /><br />Offering
          visual proof of the ancient world’s contact with advanced alien
          visitors they recorded as gods and teachers, von Däniken also raises
          the question of the “heavenly” origins of royal families and dynasties
          in Mesoamerica, Egypt, and beyond, revealing how the Mayan kings of
          Palenque and the pharaohs of Egypt may be descendants of the “gods.”

          “Over the past five decades Erich von Däniken has taken his readers to
          remote corners around the world in search of aliens. In this book he
          explores the archaeological mysteries of the Maya and their startling
          similarities in other cultures around the ancient world. Illustrated
          with over 200 of his color photographs, you’ll explore a world you
          never knew existed. Whoever still doubts that Earth was visited by
          flesh and blood extraterrestrials in the remote past needs to read and
          absorb this book to conclude: we are not alone. In fact, we never
          were. The lush pictorial evidence presented here speaks for itself.
          Put on your hiking boots, because you’re going on an adventure!”
