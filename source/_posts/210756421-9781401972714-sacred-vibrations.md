          Fascinating discoveries in science and medicine are revealing the many
          ways sound affects us at both a biological and an emotional level. At
          a time when people are seeking solace and healing as never before,
          distinguished musician and crystal singing bowl master teacher Jeralyn
          Glass has penned an intriguing narrative that impactfully shows how
          you can embrace the healing power of music.<br /><br /><i
            >Sacred Vibrations</i
          >
          shares the remarkable story of the Glass’ rise to acclaim as a
          Broadway and opera singer who graced some of the world’s most
          celebrated stages. We walk with her as she shares her exploration of
          the healing power of music that traces its roots to primitive
          humanity. We learn from the wisdom and scientific research of her
          friends and colleagues who are bringing the study of sound and music
          to an epic crescendo. And we breathe reverentially with her as she
          shares the emotional story of her son’s birth, his death, and the
          astonishingly expansive relationship she has established with him—and
          the crystal singing bowls—in the years since he passed.<br /><br />Intentional
          sound can transmute uncertainty, chaos, and pain to harmony,
          coherence, and true healing. The book grounds the ethereal nature of
          singing bowls through science, theory, and practical application. And
          it includes singing bowl meditations, accessible through QR codes, to
          guide you on your journey of integration and wholeness, showing, yet
          again, how music is “medicine” for our time.

          “Exciting new studies show us that sound truly is medicine and can
          heal us in remarkable ways.&nbsp; Jeralyn’s beautiful, heartfelt book,
          Sacred Vibrations, gives you an illuminating tour of this emerging
          discipline from one of its virtuoso practitioners.&nbsp; It is not a
          book of mere theory, though; it is a magical tapestry, woven with raw
          stories, inspiring examples, and practices that touch us at the
          core.”<br />
          <b>Stephen Dinan,</b> CEO of The Shift Network and author of
          <i>Sacred America, Sacred World</i><br /><br />“This book helped me to
          understand the healing properties and magic of music and sound, as
          well as giving me more understanding of the beautiful soul of the
          woman who wrote it.”<br />
          <b>Jada Pinkett Smith, </b>co-host of Red Table Talk and
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Worthy</i
          ><br /><br />“Jeralyn Glass is not just a master of sound, she is a
          master of heart. Her life’s work, the depth of her lived experience
          and her mission to help others have made her work potent with
          transformation and a kind of inspiration that makes you approach your
          purpose with a little more reverence and joy!”<br />
          <b>Devi Brown,</b> well-being educator and founder of Karma Bliss<br /><br />“Within
          the vibrations and harmonies of sound and music there is magic! Music
          comes from the other side of the veil where there is a vastness of
          nothing but love. Your soul essence carries a remembrance of this
          music, which is filled with love and compassion. That remembrance is
          what Jeralyn Glass has been able to tap into to share the sacred
          vibrations of the universe with humanity.”<br />
          <b>Lee Carroll,</b> original channel for Kryon<br /><br />“Have you
          ever been transported into another realm simply by listening to an
          exquisite symphony of music? Why is it that some can hear music from a
          certain composer and weep? Why is it that some individuals have even
          experienced miraculous healings because of certain harmonies and
          frequencies or specific melodies of music? The answers can be found
          within <i>Sacred Vibrations,</i> where Jeralyn Glass takes on a
          journey of exploration to discover the miraculous and transformative
          power of sound and music.”<br />
          <b>Monika Muranyi,</b> spiritual teacher and author of the Kryon
          material<br /><br />“A captivating exploration of the intersection
          between music, spirituality, and healing. Jeralyn’s personal
          experiences are woven throughout, making the book all the more
          poignant. A sacred celebration of the sound vibrations connecting
          heaven and earth.”<br />
          <b>Anita Moorjani,</b> <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of
          <i>Dying to be Me</i><br /><br />“In this high note among books on
          sound healing, Jeralyn Glass takes the topic beyond theory and
          practice, making it both practical and deeply personal. Despite her
          unparalleled expertise in music and sound, she calls in a choir of
          other experts to round out this beautiful symphony of vibrational
          wisdom. Ultimately, this poignant teaching memoir is a primer for the
          soul’s journey Home.”<br />
          <b>Suzanne Giesemann,</b> author of <i>Messages of Hope</i>
          <br /><br />“With <i>Sacred Vibrations, </i>Jeralyn Glass combines
          moving personal stories with cutting-edge research and emerges as a
          leading voice in the field of sound healing. This book is certain to
          inspire and guide people in the use of music as medicine for healing
          and transformation.”<br />
          <b>Marci Shimoff,</b> happiness expert and
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Happy for No Reason</i
          ><br /><br />“The playwright Tennessee Williams once said, ‘The world
          is violent and mercurial. It will have its way with you. We are saved
          only by love.’ This same insight is everywhere in evidence in Jeralyn
          Glass’s beautiful book <i>Sacred Vibrations</i>. She locates ‘the
          frequency of love’ in music and sound. She has a religious guide’s
          grasp of the power of faith and forgiveness; a virtuoso musician’s
          commitment to craft; a scientist’s curiosity about why and under what
          conditions sound can heal us; and the heart of a great mother. Her
          story is a quest, not only for herself, but for us.”<br />
          <b>Mike Magee,</b> President of Minerva University<br /><br />“Jeralyn’s
          ability to convey the healing and transformative potential of sound is
          commendable. From a life immersed in music, she weaves together
          intuition, science, and knowledge of how vibrations affect our
          physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual health and wellbeing. This
          book is highly recommended for anyone interested in music for
          healing.”<br />
          <b>Karina Stewart,</b> Chief Wellness Director and co-founder of
          Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary<br /><br />“This book warmed my soul!
          Jeralyn Glass is a treasured healer to this world. Her incredible
          teachings using sound and stories of her soulful son Dylan and their
          sacred connection are gifted to us in this beautiful new book. Pick up
          this book, read and hear the love it has to offer and you will find a
          new undiscovered path to your inner knowing and healing!”<br />
          <b>MaryAnn DiMarco,</b> psychic medium and author of
          <i>Medium Mentor</i> <br /><br />“After spending the first half of her
          life filling up the world's stages with her mellifluous soprano,
          Jeralyn Glass is spending the second half of her life filling up the
          spiritual void inside us with the entrancing sounds of crystal healing
          bowls. Although scientists can't explain it yet, my most jaded and
          skeptical colleagues and I have witnessed the power of this new
          therapy to relax, reinvigorate, and to repair even the most painful
          injuries through sound healing.”<br />

          intentional sound, Jeralyn weaves together the threads of her own

          the transformative power of sound, Jeralyn guides us to anchor
          ourselves in a system of wellness where intentional sound becomes our
          much-needed medicine. She shares how sound has been her steadfast

          Glass’s <i>Sacred Vibrations </i>is a transformative odyssey that
          harmonizes the soul's deepest grief with its most exalted joys.
          Through her personal journey, Jeralyn uncovers the healing power of
          crystalline sound and invites us to explore our own inner landscapes
          with courage and openness. Her narrative, rich and resonant, echoes
          the universal quest for peace, healing, and connection. As a composer
          deeply invested in the healing properties of music, sound, and
          vibration, I am moved by Jeralyn’s exploration and application of
          sound as a bridge between worlds, both seen and unseen. Her work is a
          testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the transformative
          potential of music.”<br />
          <b>Barry Goldstein,</b> award-winning composer, producer, and

          transformation and peace.”<br />
          <b>Lauren London,</b> actress<br /><br />“Jeralyn Glass is a member of
          the legion of investigators pursuing in their various ways the use of
          music as an agent for physiological, psychological, and spiritual
          healing. On the other side of the transformational intensity of her
          life and musical experience, Dr. Glass absolutely radiates
          extraordinary joy and wisdom. Sacred Vibrations takes us through her
          own resonant story:&nbsp; an ongoing tale of music, life,
          exhilaration, despair, discovery, and healing.”<br />
          <b>Dr. Vern Falby,</b> former faculty at Peabody Conservatory of the

          the ways of sound as healer. With tenderness, she guides us into
          vibrating singing bowls and music as medicine and miracle.”<br />
          <b>Joshua Leeds,</b> music producer and author of
          <i>The Power of Sound</i><br /><br />“Jeralyn Glass’s
          <i>Sacred Vibrations</i> reads like a three voice Bach Fugue written
          inside a crystal. One voice sings to her son Dylan, another voice
          tells her story as a classical musician traveling the world, and the
          third voice is a crystal bowl singing.&nbsp; The voices sound an
          amazing counter point through which the reader enters the many facets
          of the crystalline sound and music of a singing bowl. Readers will
          discover, as I did, the voices in their own lives dissolving into
          heart felt crystal clarity.”<br />
          <b>John Beaulieu N.D., Ph.D.,</b> creator of Biosonic Tuning Forks and
          author of <i>Human Tuning</i><br /><br />“The Ancient Egyptians knew
          music as a way of interacting with the mind of God. This resonance
          with the Divine elevates human emotions to create the harmony of
          Heaven on Earth. Jeralyn has managed to elevate her emotional trauma
          to spiritual levels through musical experience and knowledge. This
          radiates through the crystal singing bowls. The BioGeometry team
          discovered they contain high levels of BG3, which is a harmonizing
          subtle energy quality present in all sacred spots around the world.
          This book unites the understanding of our ancestors with the wisdom of

          is an absolute life-changing masterpiece that intertwines the realms
          of ancient wisdom and modern science and applies it to real life.
          Repeatedly, I heard from cancer patients who shared their stories of
          discovering comfort, healing, and hope through Jeralyn’s knowledge and
          her crystal alchemy sound bath sessions. Through the subtle energies
          of crystals, they discovered a sanctuary within themselves, where pain
          dissolved, and tranquility reigned. This book serves as a roadmap,
          guiding both patients and caregivers alike towards a deeper

          Jeralyn’s astounding crystalline music on Youtube, and each and every
          evening a great sense of peace washed over me. And now Jeralyn has
          written the story of how an unthinkable tragedy placed her on the path
          to becoming one of the most powerful spiritual leaders in our world

          tour-de-force exposition in the art of sound medicine, both ancient
          and modern, which beautifully and seamlessly marries sound with
          spirit. My healing experience in the Great Pyramid of Egypt, in 1997,
          led me on a quest to acquire knowledge of sound's therapeutic powers,
          and over a 25-year span, I have collected a significant library of
          books on this important subject. But during all those years, and in
          all those books, I have not encountered any that carry the loving
          heart energy contained in <i>Sacred Vibrations. </i>I highly
          recommended it for anyone on a path to discover sound as a catalyst
          for natural healing in the 21st century.”<br />

          that in this book not only does she elucidate compelling case studies
          and anecdotes from her professional practice, but also vulnerably
          shares her own journey of healing from the loss of a child, perhaps
          one of the greatest pains of life. Jeralyn is an ambassador for sacred
