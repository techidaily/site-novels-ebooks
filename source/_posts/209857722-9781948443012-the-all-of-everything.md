            Three years ago Laura Saltman was living the Hollywood dream,
            working on and for national TV shows like Access Hollywood, Today
            and E! News as a reporter, producer and pop culture expert. Spoiled,
            selfish and obsessed with her career, Laura's life revolved around
            celebrity gossip, dissecting TV shows and interviewing celebrities
            on red carpets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then something happened that
            changed her life forever. Laura's brother was diagnosed with
            terminal cancer and died&nbsp;one year later. Distraught, her dad
            committed suicide shortly thereafter and she lost two babies to
            miscarriage. During that difficult time, she started to assess who
            she was and who she wanted to be.<br />&nbsp;<br />Working with a
            spiritual guidance coach helped Laura cope with her overwhelming
            grief, as well as open up the intuitive gifts she had been hiding
            from the world since her early 20's. Suddenly, she went from a pop
            culture addicted channel changer to a spiritual channel.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Some
            people meditate to gain inner wisdom. As a journalist, this wasn't
            enough for her. She needed a tangible document, a guide book,
            something to live by each and every day.&nbsp;Inspired by writers
            like Neale Donald Walsch and Marianne Willamson, Laura sat down for
            a late-night Q &amp; A with God (Source, the Universe) to ask about
            the human world and how it truly works. Much to her surprise the
            answers came instantaneously and with astonishing clarity and
            consistency. Within just six weeks she had her book,&nbsp;"The All
            of Everything, A Spiritual Guide to Inner World
            Domination."&nbsp;Plastic surgery, relationships, celebrity gossip,
            infertility and financial struggles. No topics were off limits.
            Laura soon realized the answers provided weren't just to benefit her
            but for every human being ready to hear these powerful
            messages.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The information provided inside the
            pages of this book are so simple yet life altering. They are in
            clear and understandable language and will help move you towards
            changing the way you think and act on a daily basis, so that life
            becomes easy and unburdened. Think of this book as your spiritual
            tool box. Everything you need to fix your life is inside.
