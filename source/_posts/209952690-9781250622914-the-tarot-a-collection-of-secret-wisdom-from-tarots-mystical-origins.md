          “St. Martin's Essentials has done both the world of Tarot and the
          world of occult history (two realms that overlap but are not entirely
          the same) a great service in bringing together this wide-ranging
          abundance of source material. Some of the texts are well-known, some
          obscure—and indeed, even the more famous ones are often hard to
          find—but together they create a portrait of a long and varied
          tradition. <br />This is a major contribution.”<br />—Rachel Pollack,
          bestselling author of <i>Seventy-Eight Degrees of Wisdom</i
          ><br /><br />"This single volume brings together esoteric tarot in all
          its depth and diversity – from the wisdom teachings that are the
          foundation of today’s tarot to ‘lost’ texts that deserve new
          attention. A goldmine for every tarot collector, practitioner,
          researcher and writer."—Liz Dean, author of
          <i>The Ultimate Guide to Tarot</i><br /><br />"This wonderful
          compendium presents many of the key texts that influenced 20th century
          esoteric tarot. Now any tarot user can understand how and why we read
          cards the way we do now." —Caitlín Matthews, author of <i>Untold</i>
          <i>Tarot: The Lost Art of Reading Ancient Tarots<br /><br /></i>"This
          incredible collection of mystical and magickal thought brings together
          in a single volume the writings of some of history’s most noted tarot
          scholars, including Arthur Edward Waite, S.L. MacGregor Mathers,
          Éliphas Lévi, W. Wynn Westcott, P.D. Ouspensky, Oswald Wirth, and
          Manly P. Hall. Although these metaphysicians laid the foundations for
          our understanding of the tarot today, many of the ideas,
          interpretations, methods, and techniques presented here may be
          unfamiliar to contemporary tarot readers. <i>The Tarot </i>also
          contains valuable information and insights into astrology, numerology,
          the Kabalah, and mythology as they relate to the tarot. If you’re a
          serious student or practitioner of tarot, this compendium belongs in
          your library." —Skye Alexander, author of
          <i>The Modern Witchcraft Book of Tarot<br /><br /></i>"This book is a
          must-have resource for anyone fascinated by the symbolism and history
          of the tarot. In a single volume the reader gains access to all the
          key primary texts related to the development of the tarot as a
          divinatory art. Tarot readers will find much to enrich their
          understanding of the meanings and uses of the cards over the past
          several centuries. In addition to its rich historical information, the
          text includes hundreds of pieces of artwork, and the publisher has
          reported that this impressive undertaking required a team of seven
          editors working for nearly three years. The final result is truly a
          labor of love, which every tarot enthusiast will want to add to their
          collection. " —Anthony Louis, author of
          <i>Tarot Plan and Simple <br /><br /></i>"<i>The Tarot</i> is a rare
          book that promises life-long nourishment. It will inspire readers and
          practitioners through offering profound insights by people who have
          made the deepest studies of the subject. Diving into
          <i>The Tarot</i> made me realise how much profound information is
          missing from many modern tarot books. There are valuable discoveries
          on almost every page and within an hour of reading it, I was inspired
          to write another book on the subject. For readers who hunger for
          knowledge, this book provides a feast of information." —Paul
          Fenton-Smith, founder of Academy of Psychic Sciences and author of
          <i>Advanced Tarot </i>and<i> Tarot Masterclass<br /><br /></i>"While
          the tarot itself remains an ever evolving mystery,
          <i>The Tarot </i>combines important historical theory in a
          comprehensive and beautiful wellspring of historical, occult texts
          that belong in the collection of every tarot enthusiast - from novice
          to advanced practitioner, and everyone in between." —Stefanie Caponi,
          author of <i>Guided Tarot<br /><br /></i>"This generous compendium
          brings together several foundational documents from the onset of
          modern tarot—documents first conceived in the dim parlors and
          oak-panelled libraries of the early 20th century. It was a time when
          speculation was one narrow hair's breadth from belief; when the pack
          of cards we love could, and did, serve as a holder for all the exotic
          projections of the age. The resulting resource is a glorious,
          contradictory farrago of magical theory, cryptic symbols,
          correspondence tables, and arcane glyphs. It captures above all that
          yearning for mystery, that esoteric allure that practitioners of every
          era have found themselves unable to resist. And it allows the fearless
          reader (of books or cards alike) to sift through the past and decide
          for themselves what secrets they wish to forsake or embrace." —T.
          Susan Chang, author of
          <i>Tarot Correspondences, Tarot Deciphered </i>and<i>
            36 Secrets<br /><br /></i
          >"This massive, informative compilation pieces together ancient
          elements of divination, history, numerology, astrology, Christian
          prophecy, and even etymology from across the 19th and 20th
          centuries... those who are already well-versed in Tarot will love this
          sweeping collection."—<i>Publishers Weekly<br /><br /></i>"I don’t
          know any tarot enthusiast who won’t want this book. Even beginners
          will be entranced by the wealth of knowledge and guidance offered in
          <i>The Tarot". —New Spirit Journal</i>
