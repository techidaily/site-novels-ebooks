            >Unlock your hidden potential with this practical and approachable
            introduction to self-directed inquiry--the main meditative practice
            of the Diamond Approach.</b
          ><br /><br />Much like the ocean, each of us has inner depths: an
          entire world beneath the surface of everyday living pulsing with
          beauty, life, and mystery. The secret depths of our inner worlds are
          the very things that we spend our lives searching for: love, support,
          belonging, meaning, joy, and freedom. Through a contemplative practice
          known as diamond inquiry, you can begin to directly explore your
          conscious experience just like a diver exploring a reef. You'll
          discover wondrous treasures and terrifying sights alike, as well as
          infinite expanses, and limitless potential and freedom.<br /><br />Diamond
          inquiry combines the depth of meditation with the power of
          understanding and psychological insight. Guided by your own curiosity,
          you use a variety of questions to explore your present-moment
          experience as it unfolds, deepens, and transforms. This method was
          developed by A. H. Almaas, founder of the Diamond Approach, though the
          practice is ideal for anyone who wants to explore their inner world.
          Dominic C. Liber introduces this powerful tool along with step-by-step
          exercises to develop your understanding. Through this simple yet
          profound practice, in time every situation will become a doorway to
          realizing and actualizing deep insight and transformation.

          “I am delighted that Dominic Liber has written this book. As a teacher
          of the Enneagram, students often ask me what to do with the knowledge
          they acquire. And my response is that without <i>practice</i>, such
          learning cannot take us very far. But here, in
          <i>Diving in the Inner Ocean</i>, Dominic has provided a beautifully
          written, lucid, and friendly introduction to what I see as the central
          practice for working with our personality and for exploring the deeper
          mysteries of our essential nature—the practice of inquiry. This book
          guides us step by step into developing the tools and capacities for
          inquiry, and whether you are an experienced meditator or are new to
          inner work, the teachings here are a treasure trove of helpful
          experience and insight. I enthusiastically recommend this book.”—Russ
          Hudson, author of <i>The Enneagram: Nine Gateways to Presence</i>, and
          co-author of <i>The Wisdom of the Enneagram</i><br /><br />“The cosmic
          ocean of consciousness is such a magnificent vastness—but where to
          begin? Are you sitting at the shore longing for a way in? Or adrift
          with only a memory of a rogue wave that grabbed you only to deposit
          you back on the sand, helpless to find your way back? Do you think the
          ocean of consciousness is just one thing and miss the riches it holds?
          With his friendly, encouraging guidance, Dominic illuminates the way
          to inner exploration with a heart of adventure and the wisdom of a
          seasoned diver. The pages drip with the presence of the sea as he
          sharpens our diamond inquiry skill with the innate inner resources
          that have all but been forgotten. He deftly points us toward the
          numinous presences of strength, kindness, and steadfastness and sets
          our curiosity free to explore uncharted waters—all of it—the
          sparkling, the turbulent, the surface, and the depth. He leaves no
          shell unturned. Better yet, you will discover all of the magical
          treasures hidden within each one. Dominic offers an invitation to
          return to our natural condition as part of that vast sea. You are
          fluid as an octopus and bright as the bioluminescence that lives at
          the mysterious depths. Come on in! The conditions are perfect for a
          dive!”—Karen Johnson, cofounder of the Diamond Approach and author of
          <i>The Jeweled Path</i> and co-author of
          <i>The Power of Divine Eros</i><br /><br />“A brilliant, welcoming
          gift to the whole world. Dominic Liber lays out a lucid, warm path for
          becoming competent in an essential skill, diamond inquiry: a
          contemporary method for uncovering and manifesting our true nature.
          His work is kind and accompanied in every step with practices,
          warnings of pitfalls, and pre-forgiveness for any mistakes. Anyone
          seeking a direct experience of their authentic self will be well
          served by this compassionate, deeply human, and generous
          teaching.”—James Flaherty, MCC, author of
          <i>Coaching: Evoking Excellence in Others</i> and founder of New
          Ventures West and Integral&nbsp;Coaching®<br /><br />“Dominic’s book
          elucidating the revolutionary practice of inquiry as practiced in the
          Diamond Approach path is excellent. The process of inquiry allows us
          to penetrate through our egoic experience and discover the treasures
          that lie beyond, and is a game-changing innovation in spiritual
          technology. With clarity and simplicity, he shows us how to navigate
          our inner life, likening it to learning how to skillfully scuba dive.
          The analogy of learning to dive into the ocean that he follows
          throughout is an apt one. He teaches us how to move beneath the
          surface of our experience and explore what underlies it. As our
          acclimation to our inner ocean deepens and we become more comfortable,
          he takes us into the depths of what’s possible for us as human beings
          to experience. Not only descriptive but filled with exercises for the
          reader to practice, it is essential for those new to inquiry and a
          great enhancement for those already familiar with it.”—Sandra Maitri,
          author of <i>The Spiritual Dimension of the Enneagram</i> and
          <i>The Enneagram of Passions and Virtues</i>
