          Mindfulness—focusing on the present moment while accepting your
          feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations—is growing in popularity.
          You can find apps, online courses, and articles on the subject.
          Businesses like Google are incorporating the practice at work,
          resulting in lower stress levels, less frustration, fewer sick days,
          and less burnout. Health centers at universities are getting in on the
          act too, helping overly stressed students find relief.<br /><br />
          This basic guide to mindfulness is geared toward the curious, the
          beginner, and the person looking for real help with the burdens of
          modern life. Divided into five sections—Appreciating Mindfulness, How
          to Practice, Mindfulness in Action, Going Deeper, Going Even
          Deeper—this handy guide tells you everything you need to know to get
          rid of stress and gain newfound peace: how mindfulness works, how to
          practice it, and how to apply it in daily life.<br /><br />
          Along with explanations of mindfulness, each chapter includes a unique
          guided meditation and a timeless truth that will guide the reader to
          deal with obstacles to practicing mindfulness, living with wisdom, and
          how to create unconditional happiness through mindfulness.

          "<i>Timeless Truths for Modern Mindfulness</i> brings a freshness and
          clarity to the core principles underlying the liberating practice of
          mindfulness. Arnie’s blend of simplicity, wisdom, and psychological
          sophistication makes this book deeply relevant and alive for
          contemporary readers."—Tara Brach, author of
          <i>Radical Acceptance</i> and <i>True Refuge</i><br /><br />
          "<i>Timeless Truths for Modern Mindfulness</i> is a wise and pragmatic
          exploration of mindfulness in our daily lives. Arnie Kozak draws on
          his many years of meditation practice to highlight the many ways
          mindfulness helps awaken us to the possibilities of greater peace and
          freedom." —Joseph Goldstein, author of
          <i>Mindfulness: A Practical Guide to Awakening</i><br /><br />
          "Much like mindfulness itself is integrative, this book offers a
          wonderful and rare combination of friendly tone and solid scholarship,
          simple experiential practices plus deep wisdom, and both accessibility
          and comprehensiveness. Dr. Kozak is a warm and supportive guide all
          along the way."—Rick Hanson, PhD, author of
          <i
            >Resilient: How to Grow an Unshakable Core of Calm, Strength, and
            Happiness</i
          ><br /><br />
          "The five core principles covered by Arnie Kozak in his
          <i>Timeless Truths for Modern Mindfulness</i> (Experience is
          fabricated; No one owns the experience; You can choose not to identify
          with experience; The mind can be trained; and Happiness is
          non-contingent) will be inspirational for beginners in mindfulness
          practice. For seasoned practitioners, these are an exquisite and
          creative re-languaging of not only Buddhist understanding of
          mindfulness but also broader aspects of Buddhist thought and practice.
          The book is an exciting new addition to the growing literature on the
          subject and builds a solid bridge between secular mindfulness practice
          and Buddhist principles of mindfulness." —Mu Soeng, author of
          <i>Heart of the Universe</i> and <i>Trust in Mind</i><br /><br />
          “There are no shortage of books on mindfulness, but
          <i>Timeless Truths for Modern Mindfulness</i> stands out from the
          pack. I’ve been practicing mindfulness for over 25 years, yet I
          learned so much from this book because it contains a variety of
          approaches, some of which I hadn’t tried before. The book is both
          thorough and concise. Its coverage includes the history of mindfulness
          practice; mindfulness myths; guided meditations that cover several
          mindfulness techniques; what to do when you encounter obstacles; how
          practicing mindfulness can take you all the way to the peace and
          well-being we all hope for. As an added treat, Kozak writes in a
          relaxed, personal style that makes you feel as if you’re in a
          conversation with him. This is the cream of the crop of books on
          mindfulness and is not to be missed.” —Toni Bernhard, author of
          <i>How to Be Sick</i>, <i>How to Wake Up</i>, and
          <i>How to Live Well with Chronic Pain and Illness</i
          ><br /><br />"Everything you need to know about mindfulness and how to
          practically and effectively implement it into your life for
          unconditional happiness can be found in this book! Get it, work it,
          and be open to the world of possibility before you."—Elisha Goldstein,
          PhD, Founder of A Course in Mindful Living<br /><br />
          "Kozak makes mindfulness simple and accessible, succinctly distilling
          ancient teachings into digestible nuggets of wisdom and encouragement.
          Even those with a 'monkey mind' and a fear of meditation will be put
          at ease by Kozak's practical guidance for modern mindfulness. I found
          myself highlighting every page, as I discovered countless powerful
          insights that have already enriched my daily life."— Michaela Chung,

            >The Irresistible Introvert: Harness the Power of Quiet Charisma in
            a Loud World</i
          ><br /><br />
          "<i>Timeless Truths</i> will open your mind and heart and will lead
          you to important decisions about your own life."—Yuval Abramvotiz,
          international bestselling author of <i>The List</i> "Arnie Kozak’s
          <i>Timeless Truths for Modern Mindfulness</i> is a clear, honest, and
          informative examination of what mindfulness is and how to practice it
          and apply it to daily life. His timely book about a timeless subject
          will dispel myths about meditation, help you skillfully navigate
          obstacles, and nourish and reanimate your practice.
          <i>Timeless Truths for Modern Mindfulness</i> is an edifying and
          delightful book that will inspire novice and experienced meditators
          alike."—Jeffrey Rubin, author of <i>The Art of Flourishing </i>
