            Yoga and Resilience is part of a larger series put out by the Yoga
            Service Council in collaboration with the Omega Institute. To date,
            there have been three texts published: Best Practices for Yoga in
            Schools, Best Practices for Yoga with Veterans, and Best Practices
            for Yoga in the Criminal Justice System. This body of work takes a
            unique and groundbreaking approach of co-creation, calling on a
            diverse array of leading experts in the fields of trauma and yoga,
            to collaborate and distill best practices that will inform the
            fields of mental health, trauma-informed yoga, yoga service, and
            yoga more generally. Contributors and authors met during two
            symposia and engaged in an ongoing collaborative process resulting
            in the current text.<br /><br />Yoga and Resilience: Empowering
            Practices for Survivors of Sexual Trauma:<br /><br />
            Supports a holistic approach to ameliorating the impacts of
            traumatic stress, and specifically the impacts of sexual trauma.<br /><br />
            Serves as a resource to survivors, yoga teachers and practitioners,
            yoga service providers, trauma practitioners, and agency
            administrators among others.<br /><br />
            Presents a foundational understanding of sexual trauma and
            illuminates current best practices for integrating trauma-informed
            yoga and mindfulness practices into work with persons and systems
            impacted by sexual trauma.<br /><br />
            Explores an approach that moves beyond trauma-informed practice to a
            focus on resilience and universal inclusivity.<br /><br />
            Provides concrete tools to serve survivors better and to ensure that
            teachers and administrators not only seek to minimize harm but also
            combat sexual violence and its perpetration within yoga contexts.<br /><br />Contributors
