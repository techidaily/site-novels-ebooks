          Meditation offers, in addition to its many other benefits, a method
          for achieving previously inconceivable levels of concentration. Author
          B. Alan Wallace has nearly thirty years' practice in
          attention-enhancing meditation, including a retreat he performed under
          the guidance of the Dalai Lama. An active participant in the
          much-publicized dialogues between Buddhists and scientists, Alan is
          uniquely qualified to speak intelligently to both camps, and
          <i>The Attention Revolution</i> is the definitive presentation of his
          knowledge.<br />
          <br />Beginning by pointing out the ill effects that follow from our
          inability to focus, Wallace moves on to explore a systematic path of
          meditation to deepen our capacity for deep concentration. The result
          is an exciting, rewarding "expedition of the mind," tracing everything
          from the confusion at the bottom of the trail to the extraordinary
          clarity and power that come with making it to the top. Along the way,
          the author also provides interludes and complementary practices for
          cultivating love, compassion, and clarity in our waking and dreaming
          lives.<br />
          <br />Attention is the key that makes personal change possible, and
          the good news is that it can be trained. This book shows how.

          "This is a bold little book. Its subtitle is a boast and a lure,
          echoing the muscular self-help books that promise to make you better,
          stronger, faster. But <i>The Attention Revolution</i> is a cleverly
          disguised book about pure shamatha meditation, which Wallace defines
          here as 'a path of attentional development that culminates in an
          attention that can be sustained effortlessly for hours on end.'
          Wallace is a former monk and translator for the Dalai Lama, and now a
          scientist and religious studies scholar who's logged thousands of
          hours on the cushion. Currently he's drumming up support for The
          Shamatha Project, a one-year residential retreat for thirty people
          that will involve scientific evaluation of the subjects before,
          during, and after the retreat. One imagines that this book could be
          the participant manual. <i>The Attention Revolution</i> follows a
          rigorous ten-stage framework described by the eighth-century Indian
          Buddhist contemplative Kamalashila, but Wallace repeats often that you
          don't have to subscribe to any particular creed to experience the
          benefits of shamatha-you just have to do the work."
