            >Reveals how ancient Gnostic teachings predicted modern quantum
            physics</b
          ><br /><br />• 2024 Nautilus Book Award "Silver" Winner<br /><br />•
          2023 American Book Fest™ Best Book Award<br /><br />• Explains how
          the perennial principles of Gnosticism, a repository of
          Judeo-Christian mysticism, describe major theories of quantum physics,
          such as the Big Bang, parallel universes, the Holographic Universe
          theory, and Einstein’s Relativity<br /><br />• Shows how these
          teachings reveal consciousness as the creator of reality<br /><br />•
          Reveals how to harness quantum spirituality for personal empowerment,
          access to higher levels of consciousness, and manifestation<br /><br />From
          the dawn of history, a universal wisdom tradition has existed that
          explains humanity’s purpose in the cosmos and our relationship to the
          Master Source Consciousness. This mystical philosophy was harnessed by
          the ancient seers known as Gnostics, who were in direct contact with
          Source Consciousness. As Peter Canova reveals, not only do the ancient
          teachings of Gnosticism contain important spiritual truths, but they
          profoundly align with the modern sciences of quantum physics and
          psychology. They can also provide us with a transformative path to
          higher consciousness and practical tools to create your own reality.
          <br /><br />Merging modern science and ancient wisdom, Canova explores
          the perennial principles of Gnosticism and shows how they describe
          major theories of quantum physics, such as the Big Bang, parallel
          universes, the Holographic Universe theory, and Einstein’s Relativity.
          He recounts the Gnostic story of Sophia from a scientific standpoint,
          showing how it describes the fall of spiritual consciousness into
          material existence. He also provides in-depth evidence that Jesus
          taught a hidden, mystical Gnostic initiation rite.
          <br /><br />Explaining how the Master Consciousness created and shaped
          all life, including humans, the author reveals how Source gave us a
          critical role to fulfill in the cosmos, including the ability of our
          thoughts to affect the material world. He describes Carl Jung’s role
          in the spiritualization of psychology and how this can be used by the
          modern spiritual seeker to pursue a path of enlightenment and personal
          fulfillment. <br /><br />Ultimately showing how enlightenment is a
          process wherein outer manifestations arise from inner
          experience--including synchronicity and dreams--the author reveals how
          each of us can harness the power of quantum spirituality to transform
          our world on both an individual and collective level.<br /><br />OTHER

          “<i>Quantum Spirituality</i> stirs me in a special way. I love Peter’s
          concepts relating to the mysterious and mystical aspects of life. It
          resonates with my own experience. It is a pleasure for me to see the
          remarkably incisive knowledge that Peter has crystallized in
          <i>Quantum Spirituality</i> to help us see and accept the true
          underlying nature of life. Please read it, and let it become a part of
          your life experience too.”
