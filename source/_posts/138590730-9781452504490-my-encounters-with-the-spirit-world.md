          <p>Do you know what its like to talk to spirits?</p>
          <p>
            Have you ever seen a ghost, or wondered what happens to our loved
            ones when they die?
          </p>
          <p>
            Maybe youve sensed a presence in the house but not known how to deal
            with it
          </p>
          <p>
            Medium and Psychic, Joyce B. Duncan, can not only talk with spirits,
            she can see them too!
          </p>
          <p>
            With over 40 years of spiritual and psychic encounters, Joyce has
            met with many people, touching their hearts and lives and connecting
            them with their loved ones on the other side. One day her son asked
            her to stop these devil practices and send the spirits away. Because
            she loved him, she did, closing the veil shed worked so hard to
            open.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1997 her son died in tragic circumstances, only now, she could
            neither see him or speak to him as once she could. Devastated, she
            begged Spirit to return her gifts, but it seemed her prayers went
            unanswered as time dragged on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, two years ago a Spirit-lady came to her and said she must
            record her spiritual experiences in a book, for Spirit has a message
            that must be shared among the developing psychics and mediums
            everywhere one she herself knew all too well: Never, ever give up
            your gifts. She began writing straight away, for she was also
            promised that for every account recorded, she would receive one of
            her gifts back. My Encounters with the Spirit World is the
            realization of her lifes dream, a journey of happiness and sadness,
            a wealth of knowledge and often, deeply personal. Share the
            experience with her
