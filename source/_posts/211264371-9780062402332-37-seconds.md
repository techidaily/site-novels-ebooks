          “<b
            >Riveting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. inspiring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
            story of what happened to this woman when she died for
            <i>37 seconds</i> will make you rethink how we all should live.”
            —Maureen Maher, CBS News correspondent,<i> 48 Hours</i></b
          ><br /><br />When she was pregnant with her second child, Stephanie
          Arnold had a sudden and overwhelming premonition that she would die
          during the delivery. Though she tried to tell the medical team and her
          family what was going to happen, neither the doctors nor her loved
          ones gave her warnings credence. Finding no physical indications that
          anything was wrong, they attributed her foreboding to hormones and
          anxiety.<br /><br />One member of the medical team did take her
          concerns seriously enough, and made the fateful decision to order
          extra units of blood “just in case.” Then, during the delivery,
          Stephanie suffered a rare Amniotic Fluid Embolism. She went into
          cardiac arrest and flat-lined for 37 seconds. She died. Using the
          supplementary blood, the medical team revived her, and she remained
          unconscious for more than six days.<br /><br />After months of
          recovery, Stephanie began to remember details of her experience,
          details she knew because she had witnessed the entire dramatic event,
          including her death, from outside her body—beside other spirits that
          were with her. In this remarkable true story, Stephanie recounts her
          harrowing journey and shares her surprising spiritual discoveries: we
          are not alone and have more loving help than we can imagine
          surrounding us.<br /><br />“Stephanie Arnold’s journalistic instincts
          made this remarkable happening a compelling reading experience.”
          —Dennis Swanson, President of Station Operations at Fox Television<br /><br />“Arnold’s
          amazing, enthralling, and revealing story&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. could
          redefine the way clergy, physicians, and scientists think about
          dying.” —Dr. Rachael Ross, co-host of&nbsp;<i>The Doctors</i>
