          An accessible guide to the practice of conscious humming<br /><br />•
          Details conscious humming and breathing exercises from simple to
          advanced, including online access to examples of these practices<br /><br />•
          Examines the latest studies on sound, revealing how humming helps with
          stress levels, sleep, and blood pressure, increases lymphatic
          circulation, releases endorphins, creates new neural pathways in the
          brain, and boosts blood platelet production<br /><br />• Explores the
          spiritual use of humming, including its use as a sonic yoga technique
          and its role in many world traditions<br /><br />• Includes access to
          online examples, allowing you to experience the powerful vibratory
          resonance that humming can create<br /><br />
          Humming is one of the simplest and yet most profound sounds we can
          make. If you have a voice and can speak, you can hum. Research has
          shown humming to be much more than a self-soothing sound: it affects
          us on a physical level, reducing stress, inducing calmness, and
          enhancing sleep as well as lowering heart rate and blood pressure and
          producing powerful neurochemicals such as oxytocin, the “love”
          hormone.<br /><br />In this guide to conscious humming, Jonathan and
          Andi Goldman show that you do not need to be a musician or singer to
          benefit from sound healing practices—all you need to do is hum. They
          provide conscious humming and breathing exercises from simple to
          advanced, complete with online examples, allowing you to experience
          the powerful vibratory resonance that humming can create and harness
          its healing benefits for body, mind, and spirit. They explore the
          science behind sound healing, revealing how self-created sounds can
          literally rearrange molecular structure and how humming not only helps
          with stress levels, sleep, and blood pressure but also increases
          lymphatic circulation and melatonin production, releases endorphins,
          creates new neural pathways in the brain, and releases nitric oxide, a
          neurotransmitter fundamental to health and well-being. The authors
          show how sound can act as a triggering mechanism for the manifestation
          of your conscious intentions. They also examine the spiritual use of
          humming, including its use as a sonic yoga technique and its role in
          many world traditions, such as the Om, Aum, or Hum of Hindu and
          Tibetan traditions.<br /><br />Providing a self-healing method
          accessible to all, the authors reveal that, even if you have no
          musical ability, we are all sound healers.
