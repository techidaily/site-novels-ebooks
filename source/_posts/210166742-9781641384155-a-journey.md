            A Journey: An Attempt (and Sometimes Struggle) at Being Real in This
            World is a story of a person's profoundly diverse and undeservedly
            blessed sixty-plus years of life on this planet. From growing up in
            the sixties and seventies, traveling as a young man in Europe and
            the Middle East (with a return trip to and fourteen-month stay in
            Israel), military life, married and family life, work as a paramedic
            firefighter and as a nurse, wonderful opportunities to serve on
            medical teams to Kurdistan, Iraq; West Darfur, Sudan; and Banda
            Aceh, Indonesia; and everything in between. It really has been a
            blast. (Oh, and there was that little trip to Vietnam with Carol and
            our three kids when I was trying to make the case for our family
            living and working in South East Asia.) Through it all, good times
            and bad, smart decisions and some not so very clever, there has
            always been the undeniable realization that the Creator of the
            Universe, the Lord of heaven and earth, was right there with me and
            actually cared about the finest details of what was going on in my
            and my family's lives. Through it all, I have also come to believe
            that this same Chief Architect of the cosmos who cares about me and
            my family also truly cares about you and the finest, most intimate
            details of your life. He loves you. It's crazy, but it's
            true.Although the roads we have traveled are quite different, I was
            very motivated to write A Journey after reading Blue Like Jazz by
            Donald Miller.Hope you enjoy the trip.
