          is wonderfully thorough, exhaustively detailed, and affordable."
          <i>American Reference Books</i><br /><br />"Brad Steiger's magnum
          opus, a labor of deep scholarship elegantly written. As a reference
          source, it is invaluable for anyone interested in pursuing the
          werewolf." <i>Ancient American Magazine</i><br /><br />"Provides
          detailed information on a wide variety of mythical creatures and the
          culture surrounding them." <i>Book News</i><br /><br />"The book is
          written in Steiger’s usual popular style, and ... it should be
          popular." <i>Booklist Online</i><br /><br />"From A to Z, Brad Steiger
          presents a true encyclopedia of werewolfism, a reference masterpiece,
          overflowing with fascinating information to make readers think and
          shudder." <i>Fate</i> magazine<br /><br />"...a very professional

          Steiger continues to educate and entertain. I eagerly await his next
          book to come." <i>The Examiner</i><br /><br />"There are historical as
          well as pop culture entries in this encyclopedia, and I think that's
          what makes this book so different. Most people do not sit down and
          read an encyclopedia from cover to cover, but with this book, the
          reader can do exactly that and not feel overwhelmed with information.
          [T]his encyclopedia will appeal to more than just the average
          werewolf/vampire lover." <i>VOYA</i>
