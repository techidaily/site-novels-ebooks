            When Elissa Hope died during a routine procedure, her soul left her
            body and traveled to heaven. There she came face to face with God,
            who then sent her back to her life as his messenger - with an
            important purpose, one that would not be revealed to her until the
            time was right. A true story of divine intervention and the girl who
            came back as God's messenger, Hope From Heaven chronicles the
            author's near-death experience and tells the breathtakingly
            beautiful, spiritual love story about her and her celebrity crush
            Todd Irvin. Elissa's fairytale with Todd leads to her important
            purpose in the most mystical and magical spiritual turn of events.
            Hope From Heaven will truly take your breath away.

          Elissa Hope has written a phenomenal book about her near-death
          experience as a teenager and its impact on her today. From deep within
          her heart, Elissa shares a beautifully written story that allows a
          deeper understanding of love, faith, and the lessons that all is not
          always what one envisions them to be. This terrific page-turner reads
          like a romance novel, however don't let it fool you. There are many
          spiritual truths shared. The triumphs and sorrows that lead to her
          personal transformation are steeped in the energy of God's
          unconditional love and remembering the Angels messages. Like most
          young girls she yearned for her soulmate. Finally she found her way to
          Todd by listening to the Angelic Kingdom. However the story does not
          end there. Hope From Heaven is a great read that explores endless love
          and how to embrace God's healing light.
