            "THE TRUST FREQUENCY: Ten Assumptions For A New Paradigm" is a
            visionary, uplifting synthesis of quantum science, Eastern
            mysticism, indigenous wisdom and plain common sense. This practical
            self-help, personal-development handbook guides us through the next
            phase of our personal evolution and sets us firmly on the high road
            to happiness. Accessing "The Trust Frequency" triggers a very
            powerful upgrade to our individual and collective operating system.
            &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Humanity stands at the brink of an
            unprecedented change, a “great awakening,” the Omega Point, the
            evolutionary quantum leap predicted by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in
            "The Future of Man" (1950). All around us we see signs of gathering
            crisis, economic collapse and climate change. Contrary to popular
            sentiment, this is a good thing! The old systems based on fear and
            doubt are collapsing, as indeed they must. Only through crisis do we
            grow. Imagine what the caterpillar goes through on its way to
            becoming the butterfly. As we awaken, we realize we need a new
            reality, a new paradigm, but how do we go about creating one??
            &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We have been engaged in the endless “pursuit
            of happiness,” but happiness has eluded us. Why? Because for
            thousands of years we have based our consensus reality on a set of
            limited, erroneous, fear-based assumptions about ourselves, our
            species and about the entire universe. We can change that! The
            choice to move into the Trust Frequency triggers a shift to an
            elevated state of Being, individually and collectively. Once we
            learn to access this state of peace, love, beauty and abundance, we
            find ourselves operating at a completely different vibratory rate,
            where the laws and rules are different. Wisdom, prosperity and
            enlightenment are the order of the day. We are happy. How do we get
            there? We elevate our consciousness. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />How do
            we do that? We change our minds, or rather, the content of our
            minds. We examine and update our fundamental assumptions about the
            nature of reality, act according to our inner knowing, and our outer
            world changes accordingly. It’s an infinitely more beautiful
            Universe than we ever suspected. This book takes us there, right to
            the heart of it. Since we can choose our own reality, let us create
            a life of grace and ease, abundance, beauty and balance.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Why
            is this book important to you, the reader? Because it is a direct
            path to a higher consciousness. From a higher consciousness we
            experience a much more beautiful world. The Ten Assumptions will
            change your life, and the lives of those around you. "The Trust
            Frequency" is essential reading for anyone who is longing for an
            upward quantum shift in their own reality and in that of society at
            large. The First Assumption is this: We live in a conscious, loving
            Universe. There is only Love. That changes everything, does it not?

          guides. 'The Trust<br /><br />Frequency' is good medicine for all

          “What impressed me most about the 'The Trust Frequency' is that it is
          written<br /><br />from a higher dimensional awareness and clarity
          that energetically transfers to the reader. It explains the shift in
          consciousness unfolding on our planet and how everything is frequency
          and vibration, and how by releasing<br /><br />assumptions we can
          choose to vibrate at the higher frequency of love and<br /><br />trust
          and move into the heart of Oneness. It leaves us with the
          inspiration<br /><br />and recognition that this is our destiny.”<br /><br />DEBORAH

          happiness and compassion.<br /><br />The information in this book is
          urgently needed to move us into the next<br /><br />great human
          adventure. We stand at the threshold of a paradigmatic shift<br /><br />of
          consciousness. Learning to live in The Trust Frequency in resonance
