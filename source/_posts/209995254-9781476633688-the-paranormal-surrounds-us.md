            Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Joyce, E.M. Forster and Ingmar Bergman all
            made the paranormal essential to their depiction of humanity. Freud
            recognized telepathy as an everyday phenomenon. Observations on
            parapsychological aspects of psychoanalysis also include the
            findings of the Mesmerists, Jung, Ferenczi and Eisenbud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many academicians attribute such psychic discoveries to "poetic
            license" rather than to accurate understanding of our
            parapsychological capacities. The author--a practicing psychoanalyst
            and parapsychologist, and a lawyer familiar with Navajo
            culture--argues for a fresh appraisal of psi phenomena and their
            integration into psychoanalytic theory and clinical work, literary
            studies and anthropology.

          “A provocative and entertaining tour de force that challenges
          mainstream ways of conceptualizing both aesthetics and scientific
          inquiry.... It is not an exaggeration to call Reichbart’s oeuvre a
          masterpiece with the potential to shift paradigms.... highly
          recommended”—<i>Choice</i>; “As the topic of unconscious communication
          makes its way toward the center of contemporary psychoanalytic debate,
          Richard Reichbart has presciently provided an exhaustive account of
          the concept, both within psychoanalysis and beyond. Having been
          immersed in the worlds of both psychoanalysis and parapsychological
          research, the author constructs a tour de force that coordinates the
          traces of psi phenomena across these and other disciplines. Moreover,
          not only has Reichbart written the definitive text on psychic
          phenomena as a topic of psychoanalytic inquiry, he has written a
          deeply insightful account of the relationship between psychoanalysis
          and science. At the heart of Reichbart’s argument are pressing
          questions about the limits of contemporary scientific thinking, and
          about psychoanalysis as an effort to operate at and to expand those
          limits. Popular audiences interested in the subject of psi phenomena
          will find a great deal by which to be fascinated herein, but it is the
          psychoanalytic clinician who will most benefit from such a rigorous
          encounter with aspects of analytic theory and practice that have been
          suppressed for too long.”—Jared Russell, author of
          <i
            >Nietzsche and the Clinic: Psychoanalysis, Philosophy ,
            Metaphysics</i
          >; “Since Freud’s famous dismissal of telepathy back in 1922, ‘...I
          have no opinion on the matter and know nothing about it,’ he sent a
          strong message to his followers. Despite his own conflict over the
          subject, he warned others not to pursue this realm any further, lest
          they discredit the field. Most psychoanalysts obeyed. Most, but not
          all. Richard Reichbart, almost a century later, tells us the story of
          these courageous dissidents who dare delve into ‘the occult.’ the
          ‘paranormal,’ the ‘psi phenomena,’ and the ‘extraordinary knowing.’
          This meticulously researched work, destined to become a classic, is
          the definitive response to Freud. Fascinating and immensely readable,
          his sections on literature and culture provide the necessary
          foundation for building an interdisciplinary bridge, which moves us a
          giant step forward. In the true spirit of psychoanalysis, he shows us
          how a deeper appreciation of our own field’s past efforts to
          understand these ubiquitous phenomena will facilitate a better
          integration of new findings. This book is a must for all students,
          clinicians, and academics who want to or need to better understand and
          demystify our ‘sixth sense.’”—Ira Brenner, M.D., author of
          <i>Dissociation of Trauma</i> and
          <i>Dark Matters—Exploring the Realm of Psychic Devastation</i>.
