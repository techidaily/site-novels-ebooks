          A practical and accessible guide to sound healing therapies
          <br /><br />• Explores tools such as tuning forks, gongs, singing
          bowls, drumming, chakra chants, and angelic vibrations <br /><br />•
          Provides simple practices such as humming, vowel toning, and
          affirmations that you can begin using right away for self-healing
          <br /><br />• Explains how sound therapy triggers self-healing
          mechanisms and offers a non-invasive way to permeate every cell of the
          body with healing intentions <br /><br />All sound and vibration
          affect us. From the moment of birth--even in the womb--every word,
          thought, or sound we encounter is important and powerful, nourishing
          or toxic. When we understand the powerful effects of sound and
          vibration, we can consciously apply them for our health and
          well-being. <br /><br />In this practical and accessible guide, Erica
          Longdon explains the therapeutic and healing impact of sound,
          frequency, and vibration on the body, mind, and spirit. She shows how
          sound therapy triggers the body’s natural self-healing mechanisms and
          offers a non-invasive way to permeate every cell of the body with
          healing intentions. She presents a wide range of sound-healing methods
          and vibrational practices and explores tools such as tuning forks,
          gongs, singing bowls, drumming, chakra chants, and angelic vibrations
          as well as cymatics--the study of wave phenomena, which makes sound
          visible. She explains how to use different sound healing methods and
          offers instructions both for self-treatment and as preparation if you
          go see a sound therapist. She reveals how each of us has a sound
          healing tool at our disposal--our own voice--and provides simple
          practices and exercises such as humming, vowel toning, and
          affirmations that you can begin using right away for self-healing. She
          also explores the power of silence and how even our inner
          vibrations--thoughts and intentions--affect us sonically and can be
          used for vibrational healing. <br /><br />Offering a natural way to
          treat pain and illness, this guide gives you the tools to connect with
          your inner healer, restore balance and harmony, and harness the power
          of vibration for sound health.
