            lives. Why should you care? Because everything is about energy and
            that matters!&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Readers will discover:&nbsp;</p>
          How we react energetically to emotional abuse and the role
          dissociation plays.How the Rules of Energy Flow impact life.&nbsp;Why
          it's important to trust your intuition.&nbsp;How the Process of
          Energetic Change works.Why energy can be the problem and also the
          solution.&nbsp;How you can both lose and then retrieve peces of your
          soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          "As a psychologist and facilitator of growth, I have had the pleasure
          to be a part of this long journey of which Mariane speaks. I have
          watched as this person grew from a tightly closed flower to an open
          blossom that has many dimensions and is full of light and energy. She
          writes with heart, honesty, and integrity. I have witnessed her
          healing and her ability to become filled with peace, harmony,
          strength, and safety. I am proud of her and her ability to now live
          life to the fullest. "To each reader: I hope that this book gives you
          the courage to start on your personal road to healing and recovery
          from the pain in your life be it physical, emotional, mental, or
          spiritual." Jo Ann Cooper, PhD, Psychologist, Member, American
          Psychological Association Diplomate, American Academy of Pain
          Management Fellow, American College of Forensic Examiners "Do you know
          anyone (could be yourself, a family member, or friend) who has been
          persecuted, controlled, manipulated, or bullied? If so, this
          enlightening, inspiring book will open their eyes to the insidious,
          far-ranging impact of that emotional abuse. More importantly, it will
          show how to regain the confidence and courage to create the quality of
          life you want, need, and deserve . . . now, not someday." Sam Horn,
          author of Tongue Fu! and Never Be Bullied Again "Abuse &amp; Energy
          teaches the tools of healing the soul injured by abuse, trauma,
          hurtful family dynamics, and the dissociative reaction that impacts
          those who are abused and those who use energy abusively to hurt
          others. Mariane Weigley adds important and valuable understanding from
          her firsthand experience of less frequently discussed kinds of abuse:
          withholding, enabling, neglect, and isolation, in which energy is
          used, often quite subtly, to abuse.... If healing is to be complete,
          the spirit-energy encoded with information about who we really
          are-must be accessed fully. Mariane insightfully offers lay and
          professional readers a powerful glimpse of a complex territory right
          at the intersection of body, mind, and spirit." (Excerpt from the
          Foreword) Janice DeCovnick, PhD Clinical Psychologist Member, American
          Psychological Association
