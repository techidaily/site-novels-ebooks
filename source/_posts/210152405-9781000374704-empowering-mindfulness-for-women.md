            Empowering Mindfulness for Women is centred around a a 5-day
            intensive mindfulness course attended by eight women from different
            backgrounds. The reader is invited to imagine they are actively
            participating in the teaching and learning moments and turning
            points encountered in teaching and learning mindfulness around
            themes such as making space for mindfulness, safeguarding
            mindfulness for women, engendering mindfulness, mindfulness dreaming
            and a mandala of wisdoms. Evocative accounts of experience bring to
            life the women’s growing awareness that mindfulness can be both a
            separate practice and a natural part of life and that it can help
            them to nurture what they have neglected in themselves by not
            tapping into the full spectrum of their experience. Each chapter
            provides useful follow-up activities and questions for individual or
            group reflection, journaling, sharing and conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Empowering Mindfulness for Women is aimed at those who teach
            mindfulness to women in educational, community or clinical settings
            and at women who want to learn mindfulness in a manner that
            positions them as experts in their own learning.

          "Burrows’ rendition of mindfulness teaching and practice is remarkable
          in its close adherence to the original understanding (as conveyed, for
          instance, by Thich Nhat Hanh) while simultaneously contemporary in its
          sensitivity to the cultural context of mindfulness practice today . .
          . Facilitating, as a workshop facilitator or coursework teacher, as
          Burrows has been doing, such sharing with knowledge, wisdom,
          experience, and guidance, too, is integral to mindfulness practice.
          Unfortunately, we rarely see this done. Therein lies an immeasurable
          value of Burrows’ book under discussion here . . .
          <i>Empowering Mindfulness for Women </i>is an engaging read with its
          at-ease and flowing conversational style of writing, filled with the
          mindfulness workshop participants’ and Burrows’ dialogues, both online
          and in-person, as well as with reflective writings by the author and
          her students/participants."

          "This is much more than a mindfulness book. It’s a book about the
          inner life of women today: their struggles, dreams, and how they’ve
          come to find nourishment through Leigh Burrows’ meditative guidance.
          Centred on a mindfulness course taught by the author, the book
          challenges us to go to places where few mindfulness authors dare
          venture. It talks of wounds — individual and collective; the
          aggression and competitiveness which has taken over western
          civilisation and is killing us from within, both women and men.
          Burrows confronts our world and our psychic lives, as she gently
          guides the women she’s teaching to a place of healing which our world
          desperately needs"

          "I have admired Leigh’s writing for some time now, and this book is
          her next gift to us as she takes us into her inner thoughts, lived
          experiences, teachings, celebrations, realisations and tensions of
          being a woman with a mindfulness practice. To truly be present is
          something we all work on and we are offered not only a glimpse as
          Leigh draws back the curtain on empowering mindfulness for women, but
          we are drawn into each thread, intersection, and binary. Thank you,
          Leigh, for writing this book in the creative way that you have. You
          draw us into how we can and are a teacher, co-learner and researcher
          of our embodied mindfulness practice. You reveal so much of the
          unsaid, hidden and evaded of mindfulness. And most importantly you
          remind us of the how essential it is to make physical, emotional,
          intellectual and spiritual space for ourselves."

          "A wonderful book to savour, chapter by chapter as the reader is taken
          into the experience of a mindfulness course taught by the author.
          Every chapter is unique and a virtual feast for the senses, like
          sitting down to a beautiful dinner and letting each delicious course
          (chapter) unfold. This book is long overdue in the field of
          mindfulness in exploring mindfulness from a yin-yang
          (feminine-masculine spectrum) and trauma informed perspective. This
          book challenges us to think about how to manage the destructive
          competitiveness in universities and everyday life while offering a
          smorgasbord of mindfulness practices for developing awareness and
          self-nourishment"

          "This book opens a new door to contemporary mindfulness practices. It
          is both original and highly accessible. The reader participates in a
          women’s mindfulness course facilitated by the author who, true to the
          text’s autoethnographic style, reveals her own considerable experience
          and wisdom as a long-term researcher and teacher of mindfulness. One
          link for example, leads to the ‘deep listening’ Dadirri of the
          Australian Aboriginal people, demonstrating that to listen deeply is
          to connect – to Nature, to something greater, to others, to oneself –
          is key to the awareness needed for reciprocal warming."

          "This rich and beautiful offering takes the reader on a journey deep
          into the nuances and subtleties of teaching mindfulness. It inspires
          exciting new ways to conceptualise the cultivation of loving presence,
          as well as a range of unique and moving approaches to mindfulness
          teaching that are grounded in a deep sensitivity and attunement. The
          book is a moving invitation to teach and practice mindfulness in a way
          that is intuitive and embodied and informed by the imaginal. It also
          highlights the importance of teaching from a place of critical
          awareness that acknowledges and honours gender and the social and
          political contexts we find ourselves in."

          <strong>Leigh Burrows </strong>is Senior Lecturer at the College of
          Education, Psychology and Social Work, Flinders University. She has
          been teaching, researching and publishing on mindfulness for over a

          without realising it. She has a particular interest in assisting women
          and men to access the empowering potential of a ‘full spectrum’ of
          mindfulness possibilities rather than being locked into limiting
          binaries of ‘masculine-feminine’, ‘east-west’, ‘spirit-nature’,
          mind-body and ‘active-passive’.
