          An insider’s look into the decades of research behind Zecharia
          Sitchin’s books as well as an in-depth overview of his theories and
          discoveries <br />
          <br />• Includes carefully selected chapters from the Earth Chronicles
          series as well as never-before-published letters, articles, and
          lectures <br />
          <br />• Each piece includes an introduction, offering context and
          insight into Sitchin’s passionate work and revealing the man behind
          the theories <br />
          <br />• Explains the genesis of <i>The 12th Planet</i>, the Anunnaki
          influences on the Sumerian civilization, the orbit of Nibiru, the
          prehistory of the Americas, the extraterrestrial origins of modern
          man, and much more <br />
          <br />What if the tales from the Old Testament and other ancient
          writings, such as those from Sumer, Babylon, Egypt, and Greece, were
          not myths or allegory but accounts of actual historical events? Known
          for his ability to read and interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian
          clay tablets, Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) took the words of our most
          ancient ancestors as fact and, through decades of meticulous research,
          showed that they revealed a coherent narrative about the true origins
          of humanity and civilization. Drawing both widespread interest and
          criticism, his Earth Chronicles series of books, beginning with
          <i>The 12th Planet</i>, detailed how humanity arose after the arrival
          of the Anunnaki (“those who from Heaven to Earth came”), alien “gods”
          who created modern man in their own image and imparted gifts of
          civilizing knowledge. <br />
          <br />Providing an insider’s look into the decades of research behind
          Zecharia Sitchin’s complete works as well as an in-depth overview of
          his theories, this collection includes carefully selected chapters
          from the Earth Chronicles series as well as never-before-published
          letters, articles, and lectures. We learn about the genesis of
          <i>The 12th Planet</i> in “The Book as a Story,” the Sumerians and
          their Anunnaki influences in “The Sudden Civilization,” the orbit of
          Nibiru in “UFOs, Pyramids, and the 12th Planet,” the prehistory of the
          Americas in “Cities Lost and Found,” the extraterrestrial origins of
          modern man in “The Cosmic Connection--DNA,” and much more. We get to
          read never-before-published lectures, culled from Sitchin’s decades of
          presentations, as well as the article that spurred the writing of
          <i>There Were Giants Upon the Earth</i>. <br />
          <br />Each piece includes an introduction by Sitchin’s niece, offering
          context and insight into Sitchin’s passionate work. These
          introductions reveal the man behind the theories, a world traveler
          known for his scholarship, dry humor, and precisely chosen words. If
          his theories are true, as Sitchin wholeheartedly believed, then this
          collection presents some of the most important knowledge we have of
          our origins and future.

          “Janet Sitchin’s collection <i>The Anunnaki Chronicles </i>is a worthy
          successor to her uncle Zecharia Sitchin’s life’s work. It expands and
          enhances our understanding of who the Anunnaki were, why they came
          here, and why they may someday return.”
