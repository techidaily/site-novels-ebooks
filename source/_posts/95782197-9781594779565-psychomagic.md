          A healing path using the power of dreams, theater, poetry, and
          shamanism <br />
          <br />• Shows how psychological realizations can cause true
          transformation when manifested by concrete poetic acts <br />
          <br />• Includes many examples of the surreal but successful actions
          Jodorowsky has prescribed to those seeking his help <br />
          <br />While living in Mexico, Alejandro Jodorowsky became familiar
          with the colorful and effective cures provided by folk healers. He
          realized that it is easier for the unconscious to understand the
          language of dreams than that of rationality. Illness can even be seen
          as a physical dream that reveals unresolved emotional and
          psychological problems. <br />
          <br /><i>Psychomagic</i> presents the shamanic and genealogical
          principles Jodorowsky discovered to create a healing therapy that
          could use the powers of dreams, art, and theater to empower
          individuals to heal wounds that in some cases had traveled through
          generations. The concrete and often surreal poetic actions Jodorowsky
          employs are part of an elaborate strategy intended to break apart the
          dysfunctional persona with whom the patient identifies in order to
          connect with a deeper self. That is when true transformation can
          manifest. <br />
          <br />For a young man who complained that he lived only in his head
          and was unable to grab hold of reality and advance toward the
          financial autonomy he desired, Jodorowsky gave the prescription to
          paste two gold coins to the soles of his shoes so that all day he
          would be walking on gold. A judge whose vanity was ruling his every
          move was given the task of dressing like a tramp and begging outside
          one of the fashionable restaurants he loved to frequent while pulling
          glass doll eyes out of his pockets. The lesson for him was that if a
          tramp can fill his pockets with eyeballs, then they must be of no
          value, and thus the eyes of others should have no bearing on who you
          are and what you do. Taking his patients directly at their words,
          Jodorowsky takes the same elements associated with a negative
          emotional charge and recasts them in an action that will make them
          positive and enable them to pay the psychological debts hindering
          their lives.

          of being is in itself the truest recommendation of the path to freedom
          and creative evolution he foresees for us all."
