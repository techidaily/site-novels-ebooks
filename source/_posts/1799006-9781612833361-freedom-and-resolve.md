          <b>Home is Where You Are</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This slim volume challenges readers to discover their place in the
          universe. In it, teacher, author, and spiritual leader Gangaji offers
          the radical invitation to:Examine one’s own life.Choose to wake up
          from the trance of who you think you are and experience the truth of
          who you really are.Resolve not to go back into the trance by turning
          away from that essential experience of waking up.Freshly inquire anew
          as thoughts or feelings of separation arise.Gangaji's invitation is
          radical in part because it is not based upon a particular philosophy
          or religion. There are no prescribed practices or rituals, unless one
          considers self-inquiry or self-observation a practice.&nbsp; Most
          radically, it calls into question the very structure of who we've
          believed ourselves to be. Who you are is not separate from God or Love
          or Truth or Freedom or Peace or Silence, whatever one chooses to call
          it.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Therefore, there is nothing you have to do to "get there." No merit to
          be earned. Who you are is already here, has always been and will
          always be. The invitation in this book is to wake up and be
          Yourself.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>“My life is given to what I have received,</i><br /><i
            >which is the truth of living peace, fresh</i
          ><br /><i>fulfillment. My life is given to serving that</i><br /><i
            >truth, that fulfillment in you.”</i

          "This little book echoes the messages of many modern sounding tomes
          calling for the use of conscious awareness to break free of the ego’s
          fear-based limitations and embrace the inner wisdom that is inherent
          in all of us. Unlike many of those books, however, it also harkens
          back to the subtle, channeled texts that many of us stumbled across in
          dusty, occult bookshops forty years ago. Gangaji’s words fly free,
          like those that sparked the new consciousness revolution. Let
          customers know that this is a flight of fancy that will lead them to
          the question: How will your life be used?" -<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>,

        </h4>
        <p>
          Born in Texas in 1942,&nbsp;<b>Gangaji</b>&nbsp;grew up in
          Mississippi. After graduating from the University of Mississippi in
          1964, she married and had a daughter. In 1972, she moved to San
          Francisco where she began exploring deeper levels of her being. Today,
          Gangaji offers Sri Ramana Maharshi and Sri Poonjaji’s radical
          invitation to stop the search for fulfillment and enlightenment and to
          fully recognize the truth of one’s being, which is already completely
          whole and permanently at peace. She lives in Ashland, Oregon. Her
