          <i>Caught in the Act</i> is about surrender on several levels:
          surrendering what’s unnecessary in life, surrendering attitudes that
          keep you from pure enjoyment, surrendering yourself to the moment
          letting it take you where it wants to go rather than where you wish to
          be taken. The book is unconventional in form and manner, and is told
          in a brisk, conversational style that’s immediate and engaging. It has
          a mystery and beauty all its own.”<br />Robert Leiter,
          <i>Jewish Exponent</i><br /><br />If we’re fortunate, there are a
          couple of junctures in our lives when we have the leisure and impetus
          to reflect on the past and consider our future.
          <i>Caught in the Act</i> witnesses a mature woman contemplating how
          what you do becomes what you are. She has a curious mind, an
          indefatigable eye for detail and a serious intellect. To see what a
          mind like that does with semiretirement, read
          <i>Caught in the Act</i>.”<br /><i>Shambhala Sun</i><br /><br />This
          is no instructional manual of advice, thankfully; instead it is a book
          about learning to surrender. An informed and wellgrounded wisdom
          shines forth on every page. While the stories from her life give the
          reader a sense of connection to her, somehow the book magically
          becomes about you. Her questions become your questions, too. She
          writes unpretentiously, as one who finds it unnecessary to state the
          obvious. It is tempting to credit her decades as a book editor for the
          clarity of her writing, but the ability to turn a rigorous, analytical
          mind back on itself requires a degree of personal honesty that only
          comes with years of spiritual practice and contemplation. This is what
          makes her insight so recognizably human and relevant. It takes both
          humility and courage to first see, and then reveal oneself so
          forthrightly.<br />Never mind that she calls herself an
          almost-Buddhist,” her grasp of the issues centered around aimless aim”
          is right up there with <i>Zen in the Art of Archery</i>. If we don’t
          have any goals or intentions with whatever activity we are doing, we
          may go nowhere. Yet if we are too focused on results, we burden our
          actions with heavy expectations. This book is about finding that
          balance in your daily life.”<br />Gloria Lee,
          <i>Nonduality Highlights</i><br /><br />All those on a spiritual path
          will identify with Lippe’s struggles to simply be. Control is what so
          many of us aim for and yet surrender to experience is what all the
          sages in every mystical tradition tell us to do. Lippe counsels
          herself to be welcoming to everything and to relinquish the
          attachments that stop her from being present.”<br />Frederic and Mary
          Ann Brussat, <i>Spirituality &amp; Health</i><br /><br />Lippe’s
          anecdotes arise from her travels, her friendships, her reading, and
          her meditation practice. Her style is clear and revealing. Her book
          will appeal to those searching for what is authentic in life, as well
          as those dealing with transitions, including retirement. In becoming
          intimate with her journey, readers have the opportunity to tune in to
          their own.”<br />Tova Green, <i>Turning Wheel</i><br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          Born in London, <b>Toinette Lippe</b> had a long and distinguished
          career at Alfred A. Knopf. In 1989 she founded Bell Tower, where she
          published seventy books that nourished the soul, illuminated the mind,
          and spoke directly to the heart. Her first book,
          <i>Nothing Left Over: A Plain and Simple Life</i> was published in
          2002. After fifty years in publishing Toinette abandoned editorial
          work and devotes herself to East Asian brush painting, which she
          taught at the Educational Alliance for four years and now teaches on
          the Upper West Side of New York City.
