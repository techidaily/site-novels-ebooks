            "There is a great force moving upon your plane that is little
            understood by people and may be compared to a storm in
            consciousness, blown in from the psychic sea of the 4th Dimension,
            which transcends time and space and moves in from ancient times of
            Atlantis and into the present moment. It is ready to be calmed, if
            that is allowed by the collective consciousness of people upon this
            plane, or it is ready to wreak havoc if that is what it takes to
            complete its action."

            "This New Energy is completely unlike any other type of energy that
            has been witnessed or experienced before. It is a type of energy
            that has never been used before this creation. "The New Energy is a
            supremely powerful Being in itself whose role is to eradicate all
            evil and all impurities. It cannot be swayed or impinged upon by any
            evil forces. It recognizes its Divine order and it serves the
            express purpose of destroying all evil elements. You must be
            prepared for the days ahead. Keep the calmness within you even as
            the external world is in chaos."

            "In the Book of Malachi, Elijah's return is prophesied before the
            coming of the great and terrible day of the Lord. In various faiths
            that revere the Hebrew Bible. Derivative references to Elijah appear
            in the Talmud, The Mishnah, the New Testament, and the Qur'an."

            transformation by applying the laws we would pass on to you. You

            Upon the surface of your planet, seeming chaos is everywhere, but
            all one has to do is become centered within and recognize that each
            is going through their own version of awakening, acceptance, growth,
            and expansion and that all are united in this significant
            undertaking."
