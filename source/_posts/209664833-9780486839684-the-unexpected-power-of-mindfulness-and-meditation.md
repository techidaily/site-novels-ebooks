          "Ed and Deb bring compassion and heart to a modern world where it is
          sorely missed." — Ram Dass author of&nbsp;<i>Be Here Now</i
          ><br /><br />Behind the dramas and conflicts of life, there exists a
          quiet inner place where mindfulness and meditation can help us reside.
          The sanity and brilliance of this combination can awaken inner
          strength, foster kindness and fearlessness, and invite radical change.
          Discover how to transform your life from the inside out with the
          profound benefits of a calm and stress-free mind.<br /><i
            >The Unexpected Power of Mindfulness and Meditation</i
          >
          features personal insights from visionary leaders — Matthew Fox, Jon
          Kabat-Zinn, and Marianne Williamson among them — who discuss their
          methods of maintaining mental health and happiness.<br /><br />“Treat
          this book as you would a cookery book. You wouldn't just read recipes;
          you'd try them out. Like cookery, meditation only makes sense if you
          experience it.” — His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Nobel Peace Prize
          laureate<br /><br />"Ed and Deb remind us all just how important it is
          to look after the health and happiness of the mind. With warmth and
          humor, they show us how to integrate the timeless qualities of
          awareness and compassion into everyday life." — Andy Puddicombe,
          founder of HEADSPACE<br /><br />“Mindfulness is the awareness that
          arises when we pay attention to the present moment. It accesses us to
          core aspects of our mind that our very sanity depends on, as does our
          capacity to live wholeheartedly in this crazy world.” — Jon
          Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness teacher<br /><br />“I can be as nuts as the
          next person, living in a world like we live in with the craziness and
          chaos. It takes work to retain our sanity in the midst of all that,
          and to me meditation is the most powerful tool for doing so.” —
          Marianne Williamson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>A Return to Love</i><br /><br />“Ed and Deb Shapiro are two warm,
          caring, and capable individuals. Their work makes our planet a safer
          and more loving place to live.” — Bernie Siegel, M.D., bestselling
          author of <i>Love, Medicine and Miracles</i><br /><br />“If there is
          one book you read about meditation, this should be the one. Hear about
          some of the cool people who do it, why you should do it, and how.” —
          Sharon Gannon, Jivamukti Yoga<br /><br />“What an accomplishment! Ed
          and Deb's profoundly unique book offers a one-stop shop for those
          engaged in mindfulness and meditation. The direct transmission
          contained in this book can take us one step further. We find it
          especially useful to help stabilize spiritual activism in these
          challenging times and we'll refer it widely.” — John Steiner and Margo
          King, transpartisan activists<br /><br />“I hope that your work is
          reaching many. It deserves it and so do they.” — Stephen Levine,
          international bestselling author<br /><br />“Acceptance of what is,
          that is meditation. This book will help you make friends with your
          mind. Ed and Deb are spreading love in the world; be a part of it!” —
          Parmita Pushman, White Swan Records<br /><br />“The pausing has been
          profound. It has invited me to arrive in the here and now with my
          child clients, and to accept whatever happens without judging.” —
          Megan Cronin Larson, play therapist<br /><br />“The wonderful Shapiros
          are a conduit of joy and spiritual energy that heals hearts on their
          subtle level.” — Dr. Lex Hixon, author of <i>Coming Home</i
          ><br /><br />“Ed and Deb make a connection to their
          friends'&nbsp;spirit. They then bring their spiritual energy all over
          the world for world peace.” — Kitaro, Golden Globe Award– and Grammy
          Award–winning musician
