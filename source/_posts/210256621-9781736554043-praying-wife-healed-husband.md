            Praying Wife, Healed Husband&nbsp;is a riveting account of Marcy'
            Myles Clark's spiritual fight on behalf of her husband, Theirrien
            "Tee" Clark, as the clock was ticking on his life. His was one of
            the worst COVID-19 cases known to one of America's top hospitals in
            the early stages of the 2020 Pandemic. Hear how Marcy's remarkable
            and relentless faith stirred up a bounty of prayer warriors to
            breathe hope into a hopeless situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the entire world has been challenged by varying degrees of virus
            upheaval and panic, resulting in ever-increasing death toll
            statistics, this book reminds us that there is a human element to
            this crisis that supersedes numbers. It reminds us to take inventory
            of our spiritual life while we still can. It reminds us that with
            every trial in life, we have the opportunity to respond with faith
            or with fear. When Marcy chose faith, miracles happened.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Before March of 2020, Tee &amp; Marcy were your typical, fun loving,
            empty-nester couple, living their lives to the fullest. Then, in the
            blink of an eye, life as they knew it drastically changed. During
            March 2020, COVID-19 struck their household forcing them to endure
            the ultimate test of faith to not only sustain their marriage and
            finances but life itself!
          </p>
          <p>
            Tee spent 46 days isolated, for the most part, from his beloved wife
            and family as Johns Hopkins Hospital's worst COVID-19 case at that
            point in time. With 28 of those 46 days in a medically induced coma,
            it wasn't looking good for Tee from a physical and medical
            standpoint.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This book will have you devouring every page consisting of Marcy's
            journal entries, progress notes from Tee's medical team, and
            inspiring text messages to and from her friends, family, and
            spiritual leaders. You'll be intrigued by Tee's personal account of
            matters as he fought to defy death several times while intubated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately for Tee &amp; Marcy, they had excellent health insurance
            and other affairs in place to overcome this major curveball life
            threw their way. As a bonus, enjoy their self-help section full of
            expert advice and resources to assist you in getting your own house
            in order regarding your health, wealth, and relationship wellbeing.
            Now, more than ever, you must protect yourself in these times of
            crisis.
