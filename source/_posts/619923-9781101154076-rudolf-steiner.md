          The first truly popular biography of the influential twentieth-century
          mystic and educator who-while widely known for founding the Waldorf
          schools and other educational and humanitarian movements-remains a
          mystery to many who benefit from his ideas. <br /><br />
          People everywhere have heard of Waldorf schools, Biodynamic farming,
          Camphill Villages, and other innovations of the Austrian philosopher
          Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925). Indeed, Steiner—as an architect, artist,
          teacher, and agriculturalist—ranks among the most creative and
          prolific figures of the early twentieth century, pioneering work in
          alternative education, holistic health, and environmental research.
          <br /><br />
          While his accomplishments are felt all over the world, few people
          understand this unusual figure. Steiner's own writings and lectures
          fill several bookcases, intimidating those who would like to know
          more. Works on Steiner are often dense and "insider" in tone, further
          deterring the curious. No popular biography, written by a sympathetic
          but critical outsider, has been available. <br /><br />
          Gary Lachman's <i>Rudolf Steiner</i> provides this missing
          introduction. Along with telling Steiner's story and placing Steiner
          in his historical context, Lachman's book presents Steiner's key ideas
          in a readable, accessible manner. In particular, Lachman considers the
          spread of Steiner's most popular projects, which include Waldorf
          schools-one of the leading forms of alternative education-and
          Biodynamic farming-a popular precursor to organic farming. He also
          traces Steiner's beginnings as a young intellectual in the ferment of
          fin de siécle culture, to his rise as a thought leader within the
          influential occult movement of Theosophy, to the founding of his own
          metaphysical teaching called Anthroposophy. <br /><br />
          Finally, the book illustrates how Steiner's methods are put into
          practice today, and relates Steiner's insights into cosmology to the
          work of current thinkers. <br /><br />
          <i>Rudolf Steiner</i> is a full-bodied portrait of one of the most
          original philosophical and spiritual luminaries of the last two
          centuries, and gives those interested in the history of ideas the
          opportunity to discover one of the most underappreciated figures of
          the twentieth century.
