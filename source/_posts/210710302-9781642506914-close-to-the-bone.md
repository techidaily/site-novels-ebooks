          <b>Face Life Threatening Situations and Find Hope</b>
          <p>
            “This book can be a companion to anyone in physical or mental pain
            and crisis.” —<b>Louise L. Hay</b>, author of You Can Heal Your Life
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >When confronted with a life threatening condition, most people
              think that doctors have the final word. But, Jean Shinoda Bolen
              reminds us that the mind has a powerful effect on a prognosis and
              the process of healing.</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Everyone faces illness.</b> Whether it’s a personal health crisis
            or sickness a loved one is experiencing, none of us escape this life
            without encountering some form of illness or death. While we can try
            to ignore the reality, internationally known author and speaker Dr.
            Jean Shinoda Bolen suggests we do the exact opposite: face it. By
            encountering the frightening world of serious illness and death, we
            can better uncover how it gives purpose to the journey of souls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Trust what you know in your bones.</b> Dr. Bolen shares how what
            we learn often connects to what we know to be true. As a
            psychiatrist and Jungian analyst, Dr. Bolen has an acute
            understanding of what shapes a person, particularly as it relates to
            one’s sense of balance and wholeness. Based on her knowledge and
            experience, she guides us to find the truth buried in our own bones.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>A tool for help and healing.</b> While encountering sickness is
            inevitable, healing often seems harder to come by. We are left
            broken open when life threatening illness hits. While there is no
            single key to recovery, it is rare to find healing without first
            addressing the pain. This book serves as a guide to finding purpose
            in the pain.

          “This is the book I needed when my daughter was sick. It would have
          helped me through it, like a map of the underworld. Myths, stories,
          prayer, touching, visualization, rituals, and especially love are some
          of the tools and wisdom that this extraordinary book gives us. Thank
          you, Jean.” —Isabel Allende
        </p>
        <p>
          “Richly probing… A skillful assemblage of views on the harrowing

          want our lives to be.” —Publisher’s Weekly

          death.” —Alice Walker
        </p>
        <p>
          “Jean Shinoda Bolen moves far beyond the ordinary notions of medicine,
          treatment, and even suffering to place illness within a human
          framework. When you are sick, read pages from this book to be reminded
          that you and your illness are full of soul.” —Thomas Moore, author of
          Care of the Soul
        </p>
        <p>

          “Beautifully written… Anyone affected by a serious illness will find
          Close to the Bone a wise and warm companion.” —New Age Journal
        </p>
        <p>
          “Jean Shinoda Bolen has created a poetic rhythm that will uplift the
          spirit and soul. This is a deep, powerful, and gentle book, in which

          power of prayer and angels.” —Gerald G. Jampolsky, MD, founder of the
          Center for Attitudinal Healing
        </p>
        <p>

          “The great teacher is our mortality. Let this book be a guide to your

          mortal. Accept that —read this book and live a fuller, healthier, more
          meaningful life.” —Bernie Siegel, MD, author of Love, Medicine and
          Miracles
        </p>
