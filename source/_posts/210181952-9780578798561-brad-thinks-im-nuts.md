          <p><strong>Brad Thinks I'm NUTS!</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Because I learned to use my PSYCHIC abilities</strong></p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Learn the truth about psychic experiences in an easy 10-minute
            experiment with a few friends. What if a simple
            <strong>change to your mindset </strong>showed you that you were
            subconsciously sharing information mentally with your friends?
            Imagine that your entire outlook on life is altered for the better
            when you see clear evidence that
            <strong
              >subconscious communications are real and you can do it.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Author, Steven Ware Smith, is<strong>
              a science guy through and through.</strong
            >
            He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering from
            the United States Naval Academy. He flew fighter jets in the Navy
            and then worked as a radar engineer. He later went to law school and
            became a patent attorney. He obtained hundreds of patents for his
            clients in the field of high-tech telecommunications. He's even
            named as an inventor on 15 U.S. patents himself.
            <strong
              >Not only that, he grew up never having a single psychic or
              spiritual experience.</strong
            >
            So he became <strong>a die-hard skeptic</strong> until a friend
            convinced him to participate in a simple telepathy experiment that
            proved beyond a doubt that he and two friends communicated mentally.
            <strong>His world view was shattered</strong>, so for the next 24
            years, he studied dozens of spirituality books and took courses in
            meditation, expanded consciousness, and remote viewing. He now wants
            to share with you the amazing things he discovered and show you how
            to discover them yourself.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Brad Thinks I'm NUTS!</strong> is designed for the curious
            person who has never had a psychic or spiritual experience. Don't
            worry-it does not cover far-out psychic topics like psychic healing,
            aura viewing, yoga wisdom, crystal gazing, astrology, channeling,
            destiny, or karma, which are difficult for most beginners to believe
            in. Instead,
            <strong
              >it sticks to the basic goal of showing you how to have your first
              psychic experience.</strong
            >
            The straightforward experiments in this book are designed to crack
            open the door for you the way Smith's telepathy experiment cracked
            open the door for him 24 years ago.

            Scientific studies have shown that <strong>everyone</strong> has
            psychic abilities. They are just a part of being human. Most people
            don't realize they have these abilities and don't know how to use
            them, but many have been <strong>trained</strong> to use them to
            create happier, healthier, and wealthier lives.

            With practice, you'll be able to recognize information coming from
            your subconscious mind. For many of us, this information is so
            subtle and so fleeting, we don't consciously perceive it. Yet it
            holds immense value for enabling us to live up to our full
            potential.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            You can learn the truth about the subconscious powers you never knew
            you had.&nbsp;
