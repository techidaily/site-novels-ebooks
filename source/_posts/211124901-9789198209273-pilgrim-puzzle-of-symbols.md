            <strong>Pilgrim: Puzzle of Symbols&nbsp;</strong>is a self
            development, spiritual awakening memoir about freedom, self worth
            and the ability we have to heal ourselves. You are invited on a
            personal and emotional journey through time and space. Beautiful
            nature, sacred sites, and powerful healing experiences in the
            forests of Sweden open a portal to the vulnerable inner world, where
            feelings, thoughts and a spiritual journey unfolds on the pilgrim
            paths. Working with the pilgrim's symbols creates personal growth
            and ancient wisdom unfolds.

            As we encounter setbacks and success in the story, new perspectives
            become available on a deeper level, reminding us that the only thing
            that stands between us and magical experiences is ourselves.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The book is a kind reminder, that when we love life, good days will
            come. It´s a story of gratitude, freedom and lifestyle change.

            Travel on the Scandinavian pilgrim roads, learn the difference
            between a hike and a pilgrim walk and follow the transformation on

              expected. Some readers report going into the woods for meditation
              or starting the search for their own walking staff, while others
              finally went on that pilgrimage they've been dreaming of or took a
              vacation with friends.</strong

            "Between 9 pm and 1.30 am I have laughed, cried, felt anxiety and so
            much love. I couldn´t put the book down, I just had to keep on
            reading. I love how you describe environments, feelings and your
            thoughts...
          </p>
          <p>
            This inspirational memoir is the best self help book I have read for
            a long time,"

            >"This book is full of poetic imagery, adventure, and soul
            exploration! It made me want to live a richer life and take a
            fearless adventure of my own. It inspired me to prioritize more
            physical time for soul healing. I've done some organized classes and
            brief nature walks, but this book showed me the value of walking a
            much freer path and deepening our connection to the magic of life. I
            long to travel to the places where the veils between worlds are
            thinner like she describes in the book. I felt like I was taken
            along on this journey of emotion and discovery. Beautiful book". /

            fiction, but I am so glad I was wrong. The author has a natural
            talent for taking you with her so that you can experience the same
            journey. Beautifully written and captivating throughout. I've never
            been to Sweden, but now I feel like I have." /Charles Bell</span

            >"At every milestone, life gives us strong signals on what's best
            suited for us. We must be alert, attentive, and sufficiently
            intuitive to pick up on these signals. This book is a classic
            example of how you can achieve this. Balance keeps you grounded, but
            it must be accompanied by simplicity, ease, and the freedom to
            thrive as your best and authentic self. You must know when to resist
            and when to go with the flow. A spiritually soothing read!"/ Meera

          story about finding your path even when life hasn't gone as you
          planned. The lesson of finding joy and contentment despite difficulty
          and disappointment is so valuable. I especially like the passage on
          the cycles of life I included here. Well done!"/ Jennifer Lauren
