          A rebel angel’s perspective on the Lucifer Rebellion 203,000 years ago
          and her insight into its past and future effects on consciousness
          <br />
          <br />• Explores how the angelic revolt led to Earth’s celestial
          quarantine for more than 200,000 years <br />
          <br />• Draws parallels between the Process Church and the Lucifer
          Rebellion <br />
          <br />• Describes the rise and fall of Lemuria in connection with the
          rebel angels <br />
          <br />• Reveals how the 100 million angels currently incarnated in
          human bodies can help with Earth’s return to the Multiverse and the
          coming transformation of consciousness <br />
          <br />After 200 millennia of celestial quarantine in the wake of
          Lucifer’s angelic revolt, Earth and the rebel angels isolated here are
          being welcomed back into the benevolent and caring Multiverse. With
          this redemption comes a massive transformation of consciousness and a
          reconnection to our cosmic destiny. But why did the angels revolt and
          how has that event shaped our planet’s past and its future? <br />
          <br />Writing through Timothy Wyllie, rebel angel Georgia shares
          insights from her half a million years stationed on Earth as a watcher
          and from her part in the angelic revolution. She reveals details of
          the Lucifer Rebellion, including the role played by Planetary Prince
          Caligastia and his team of angelic administrators--thought by some to
          be the Nephilim or Anunnaki of Sumerian myth--who followed Lucifer
          into the rebellion, ultimately leading to the quarantine of Earth and
          36 other planets. Interweaving her story with events from Wyllie’s
          life, Georgia draws parallels between Wyllie’s involvement with the
          Process Church in the 1960s and the events of the angelic rebellion
          and celestial quarantine. She explores the rise and fall of the island
          civilization of Lemuria, or Mu, as well as Atlantis and the Maya.
          <br />
          <br />Georgia reveals there are more than 100 million rebel angels
          currently granted mortal incarnation on Earth at all levels of society
          and in all countries--most of whom are still unaware of their angelic
          heritage. Now that we are free of Prince Caligastia’s
          behind-the-scenes manipulations, the stage is set for the rebel angels
          to begin redeeming their past and help Earth realize its significance
          in the wondrous destiny of the Multiverse.

          Trained as an architect, Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was a graphic
          artist and writer who, after a near-death experience in 1973,

          ETs, and dolphins. He was the author of several books, including
          <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels</i> and
          <i>Awakening of the Watchers</i>.
