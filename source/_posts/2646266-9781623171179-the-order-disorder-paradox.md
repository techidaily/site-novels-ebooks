          Increasing order in a system also creates disorder: this seemingly
          paradoxical idea has deep roots in early cultures throughout the
          world, but it has been largely lost in our modern lives as we push for
          increasing systematization in our world and in our personal lives.
          Drawing on nearly five decades of research as well as forty-five years
          working as a psychoanalyst, Nathan Schwartz-Salant explains that, in a
          world where vast amounts of order are being created through the
          growing success of science and technology, the concomitant disorder is
          having devastating effects upon relationships, society, and the
          environment.&nbsp;As a Jungian analyst with training in the physical
          sciences, Schwartz-Salant is uniquely qualified to explore scientific
          conceptions of energy, information, and entropy alongside their
          mythical antecedents.&nbsp;He analyzes the possible effects of created
          disorder, including its negative consequences for the creator of the
          preceding order as well as its potentially transformative functions.
          With many examples of the interaction of order and disorder in
          everyday life and psychotherapy,&nbsp;<i
            >The Order-Disorder Paradox&nbsp;</i
          >makes&nbsp;new inroads into our understanding of the wide-ranging
          consequences of the order we create and its effects on others and the
          environment.

          “This brilliant, wise, and profound book is a masterwork by one of the
          world’s leading psychologists. Drawing on a vast array of sources and
          a lifetime’s experience, Nathan Schwartz-Salant reveals a great truth
          hidden at the heart of the world’s authentic mystical traditions: that
          all new order also creates disorder. This extraordinary work is a
          must-read for all those who want to understand the rhythms of life and
          the meanings of our contemporary chaos.”<br />—Andrew Harvey, author
          of <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>The Order-Disorder Paradox</i> is the result of five decades of
          devoted investigation in the domains of mathematics, engineering,
          psychology, and mysticism. It is not only a cogent, elegant, and
          highly original theory but also an eminently practical way to
          understand the seemingly unpredictable oscillations of psychological
          healing and personal transformation. This book calls for powerful and
          immediate shifts in how we approach the clinical encounter as well as
          the life of the soul.”<br />—Lorie Eve Dechar, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Five Spirits: Alchemical Acupuncture for Psychological and
            Spiritual Healing</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Schwartz-Salant offers a far-reaching and profound exploration of the
          dialectical interplay between order and disorder. Moving beyond the
          contemporary rationalist worldview that seeks to repress disorder in
          favor of order, he points us to a trans-rational alternative well
          suited to our tumultuous times—an alternative that, in harking back to
          our pre-rational origins in myth, does not merely regress to those
          origins but carries us forward into new territory.
          <i>The Order-Disorder Paradox</i> is a highly significant, compelling
          work that deserves the rapt attention of theorists, psychoanalysts,
          and laypeople alike.”<br />—Steven Rosen, Emeritus Professor of
          Psychology, College of Staten Island, City University of New York;
          author of <i>Dreams, Death, Rebirth&nbsp;</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This long-awaited book comes at just the right time—not only for
          psychotherapists, who will benefit greatly from its clinical insights,
          but also for scholars of politics and culture. This is a deeply
          thought-out work, the fruit of many years of reflection and patient
          observation.”<br />—Murray Stein, PhD, author of
          <i>Soul: Treatment and Recovery</i>
