            >YOU: A Spiritual Being on a Spiritual Journey: A New Paradigm for
            Living Life</i
          >&nbsp;is a book about knowing yourself, not just as a Mind and a
          Body, but as an eternal spirit or Self, a vibration that is eternal.
          More importantly, this book is about being able to communicate with
          that eternal Self in a way that allows you to complete the journey you
          are here in this lifetime to fulfill. It teaches you how to Connect to
          the Self and how to use such connections to live a satisfying and
          fulfilling purpose-driven life.&nbsp;<i
            >YOU: A Spiritual Being on a Spiritual Journey</i
          >&nbsp;will give you the ability to find personal answers to live a
          better and more fulfilling life. By distinguishing between the Mind
          and the Self, this book provides specific tools that anyone can use to
          access their intuitive Self. It also includes stories of others who
          have experienced a true connection to&nbsp;<i>Self</i>&nbsp;and how
          that has helped them to evolve in a variety of areas including in
          their relationships, careers, finances, health, and more.&nbsp;Moving
          away from your current paradigm of the Mind to one that gives you a
          Connection to your Self, will feel as natural as breathing with
          Indira's techniques as your guide. And you will feel a level of peace
          you may never have thought possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i
            >“As I began connecting to the Self within, a clear communication
            arose that through these four simple steps of Connect, Listen,
            Trust, and Act, anyone can live a life from a place that honors the
            journey their Self is here to unfold.”</i
          >&nbsp;–Indira Dyal-Dominguez, from the Introduction

        <p>
          <b>Indira Dyal-Dominguez</b>&nbsp;never felt particularly fulfilled
          from what she was doing. Sure, she was making a good living and making
          a difference in people's lives, but there was something missing; she
          was not truly fulfilled and didn't feel as though she quite belonged -
          no matter where she was or what she was doing. After pursuing a
          variety of paths toward inner growth, she had an epiphany one day that
          the most important journey one endeavors to undertake is the journey
          of the eternal Self. She realized in the current paradigm that people
          are turning to their Mind for answers to everything and, while that's
          fine for certain things - especially having to do with sheer survival
          - it does not allow for a calming, peaceful way of life. In&nbsp;<i
            >You: A Spiritual Being on a Spiritual Journey</i
          >, she provides the tools and guidance you need to tap into and
          connect with the whole of you - Mind and Self. She teaches you how to
          use those connections to live a satisfying and fulfilling,
          purpose-driven life, and she includes exercises for you to start
          getting results in your life immediately. Visit Indira online
