            This extraordinary book brings together many sources of important
            information on the changes occurring within our world, ourselves,
            and the evolution of consciousness leading up to the year 2012. The
            text is addressed in part to Lightworkers, for whom the energy shift
            now gearing up has been ongoing for at least the last twenty years.
            The time is getting closer. <i>The Great Shift</i> is a progress
            report from the field and the messages are positive. “You don’t have
            to logically do anything but ‘show up’ with spiritual intent, and
            the DNA quantum field is activated in your body,” Kryon says. He
            tells us to expect changes and peace we may have never thought to
            see in our lifetimes, even in the Middle East. He says, “God is not
            a controlling force. Look for the love.”

            Thomas Kenyon channeling the Hathors, a group consciousness entity,
            reminds us, “It is your attention to an event that makes it
            conscious.” Kenyon also explains what channeled material is, which
            is important in understanding how we co-create our own world: “From
            the standpoint of neuropsychology, channeled information is just
            another expression of our brain/mind potential . . . a movement into
            the unknown territory of one’s own psyche to see what emerges in
            terms of contact (with other intelligences) and information.” The
            Hathors message for what is now and what is to come: “It is so
            simple, it is forgotten. . . . Find a way to live your life in joy
            and happiness.” Mary Magdalene, through Thomas Kenyon, makes it
            clear that restoring the balance between male and female energies
            will mean good things for men as well as women and will reignite our
            creative potency. Patricia Cori channeling the High Council of
            Sirius reminds us that the future is never predetermined and the
            past is an illusion—different for each of us.
