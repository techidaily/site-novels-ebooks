            “<i>UAPs and the Nuclear Puzzle</i> will help inform the public and
            move us forward on our journey toward a new understanding of
            history, UAP, and of our own true nature with respect to the larger
            reality that is revealing itself to us.”<br />
            —<b>Leslie Kean</b>, bestselling author of
            <i
              >UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the
              Record</i
            ><br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            “I can’t overstate the significance of military testimony from
            witnesses such as former launch control officer Robert Salas. It’s
            brave folks like him who have kept me pushing for further government
            transparency on what may turn out to be the biggest story in modern
            times.”<br />
            —<b>James Fox</b>, director and producer of <i>Moment of Contact</i
            ><br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Robert Salas, a retired United States Air Force officer, witnessed
            firsthand a UAP (unidentified aerial phenomenon) while visiting and
            disabling nuclear missiles. He shares his experience as well as the
            many incidents of similar visits during the last eighty years that
            have been covered up.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            In 1969, the US Air Force issued a statement that read‚ “No UFO
            reported, investigated, and evaluated by the Air Force was ever an
            indication of threat to our national security.” This statement has
            been proven untrue by the testimony of many military officers and
            airmen and the documentation of incidents involving UFOs and nuclear
            weapons, testimonies of which the US Air Force was fully aware.
            <i>UAPs and the Nuclear Puzzle</i> details many of these
            testimonies—some for the first time.
