          experienced witches looking to revitalize their practice,&nbsp;<i
            >Inner Witch</i
          >&nbsp;is infused with equal parts heart and humor, reverence and
          rebellion. Gabriela Herstik’s refreshing approach to magic is eclectic
          and egalitarian, affirming the importance of accessibility in
          contemporary witchcraft.&nbsp;<i>Inner Witch</i>&nbsp;demonstrates why
          spellwork and ritual aren’t mysterious traditions only to be used by
          the chosen few, but vital and necessary tools for everyone who might
          want—or need—to connect with nature, call in feminist community, or
          conjure self-care."—<b

          ><br /><br />“The modern manual for a generation of women reclaiming
          their connection to ancient and powerful traditions and practices that
          can empower, enliven, and shift the lives of anyone from any culture
          or socioeconomic class. A must-have for anyone looking to reclaim an
          innate connection to the self and magic.”—<b
            >Alexandra Roxo, co-founder of Moon Club</b
          ><br /><br />“With so much knowledge spread over so many disciplines
          and traditions, it can be intimidating for those called to explore
          their personal magic to find a place to start. Herstik has written a
          modern guide for an eclectic witch: a friendly crash course in
          spiritual vocabulary and technology that gives readers the broad
          foundation they need to find their inner spark.”—<b

          ><br /><br />
          “Herstik writes about witchcraft in a manner that is accessible,
          unerring, but most of all, glamorous. Herstik is not a side effect of
          witchcraft becoming trendy; she is one of the witches who has made it
          such."—<b
            >Sophie Saint Thomas, writer, co-host of <i>The Serpent Cast</i></b
          ><br /><br />"Herstik demystifies witchcraft and articulates it in a
          way that makes this ancient art accessible and inclusive to all. This
          book is a must-read for anyone who's ready or curious to awaken their
          inner witch."—<b>Tamara Driessen, author of <i>The Crystal Code</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Herstik is&nbsp;warm, lovely, and engaging. Tune into
          your inner witch and be a force for good for all.”—<b
            >Carolyne Faulkner, author of
            <i>The Signs: Decode the Stars, Reframe Your Life</i></b
          ><br /><br />"A mesmerizing introduction to twenty-first&nbsp;century
          witchcraft and the tools of thought and practice to unearth your
          nascent sorceress. Herstik’s advice is practical yet profound and
          unpicks complex ideas and symbology with a refreshing lightness.”—<b
            >Elisabeth Krohn, founder and editor, <i>Sabat</i> Magazine<br /></b
          ><br />“Gabriela Herstik knows her stuff and&nbsp;covers a lot
          of&nbsp;ground in this marvelous book. Her knowledgeable
          writing&nbsp;is packed with information, but flows the&nbsp;easy way a
          conversation would on a girl’s night out. Whether you’re just setting
          out on your magickal journey or already practicing, there’s something
          in this book for everyone. <i>Inner Witch</i>&nbsp;would be a great
          addition to any metaphysical library."—<b
            >Pleasant Gehman, author, psychic, witch</b
          >
          <br /><br />“[Herstik] is here to make you believe in magic… She
          transforms the often intimidating and arcane subject into an
          approachable form of self-care that can be practiced by anyone willing
          to learn. In fact, you could almost swap out ‘witch’ for ‘empowered,
          liberated woman’ and the book would still read seamlessly.”—<b
