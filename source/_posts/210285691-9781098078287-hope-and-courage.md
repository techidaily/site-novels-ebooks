            It's a subject nobody wants to talk about until it attacks them!
            Unless you have been through it yourself, you cannot relate or fully
            understand what that person is going through. It's time to bring
            this topic out into the open and "talk" about it and realize that no
            one can get through it without support, family, friends, and faith.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            My journey started in 2013 with my first surgery to remove lymph
            nodes. The results were "inconclusive." Five years went by before my
            lymph nodes would again decide to "freak out" and require another
            surgery. This time we got answersâ€¦
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The smell of spring was in the air, and the day was sunny and warm.
            I was trying to finish up the current school year with my kiddos
            when everything changed. My husband and I had big plans for the
            summer. We were looking forward to kayaking, camping, fishing; and I
            was looking forward to playing softball. Then came the doctor's
            appointment, and when the doctor said cancer, everything came to a
            screeching halt in more ways than one.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Cancer is devastating, but I chose to put on my armor and fight this
            beast head-on. I did not realize just how difficult this "battle"
            was going to be and how much I would be tested physically,
            spiritually, and mentally. This is the hardest thing I have ever had
            to face; but with God, family, and friends, I was able to defeat the
            beast "for now."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Was it easy? No! Do I want to go through it again? No! But after
            talking with many cancer survivors, I learned that anything is
            possible through prayer and perseverance. I hope that sharing my
            story may help someone else get through their journey with hope and
            courage.
