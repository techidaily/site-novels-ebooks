          A comprehensive guide to the inner psychology revealed by the hand
          <br />
          <br />• Details how to interpret the entire hand--the shape of the
          palm and fingers, mounts, lines, fingerprints, flexibility, nails, and
          skin texture <br />
          <br />• Reveals the personality archetypes, strengths, and weaknesses
          connected with each of the seven mounts and how the rest of the hand
          modifies these traits <br />
          <br />• Explains how lines change and the decisive influence of the
          person’s own mind in healing defects found on the lines <br />
          <br />Palmistry is a science and a universal language. The hand tells
          a story about your talents, relationships, health, and how you feel
          about yourself. It reveals periods of ease or challenge in your life,
          and it speaks about your weaknesses and the traits you need to
          develop. As you change, so do your hands, reflecting the progress you
          have made. <br />
          <br />In this comprehensive guide to hand reading, based on Ellen
          Goldberg’s 40 years of teaching palmistry and the Western Mystery
          tradition, the authors make the powerful insights of the hand
          accessible in an inviting and user-friendly manner. The book presents
          the character traits and personality archetypes associated with each
          of the seven mounts of the palm and shows how to determine which are
          most influential in the nature of the individual. The mount archetypes
          reveal the lifestyle, love,sex, and marriage preferences; the best
          career choices; and the unique strengths and weaknesses for each
          person. The book also examines other factors that enhance the
          qualities revealed by the mount types, including the flexibility of
          the hand, texture of the skin, and the shapes of the fingers,
          fingertips, and nails. The meaning of each major and minor line is
          described in detail as well as the influence the person’s own mind has
          in healing defects and obstacles found on their lines. The authors
          also provide accurate timing guides for each line, making it possible
          to locate specific events and to see how your lines change over time.
          <br />
          <br />Presenting the hand as a guide to self-fulfillment,
          <i>The Art and Science of Hand Reading</i> incorporates
          correspondences to other mystical sciences such as astrology,
          Kabbalah, the Hermetic teachings, and archetypal psychology. It also
          includes practical examples and more than 600 illustrations to show
          how to integrate the meanings of each part of the hand to form a
          complete picture of your inner psychology and your ever-changing
          destiny.
