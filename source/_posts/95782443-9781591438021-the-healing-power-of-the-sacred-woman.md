          How to enhance well-being by reconnecting to sacred womanhood <br />
          <br />• Shares ways to embody the power, wisdom, and compassion of the
          Great Mother <br />
          <br />• Reveals a woman’s purpose is to give birth not only to new
          life but also to new levels of consciousness <br />
          <br />• Shows how female illnesses represent a disconnection from our
          true identity as women <br />
          <br />Four thousand years ago, women were seen as living
          representatives of the Great Mother, whose cyclical and potent energy
          gave birth to all existence. Today, this sacred awareness has been
          lost or distorted, causing a collective amnesia among women around the
          world. However, there is one symbol of the Great Mother’s loving
          presence that has remained unchanged for tens of thousands of years:
          the physical body. Its curves, sensuality, softness, and monthly flow
          are constant reminders of this deep loving connection. When illness
          appears, especially within the breasts and fertility organs, a woman
          is being reminded to return to her pure and sacred identity, where
          death and birth are essential for growth and love flows without
          expectations. <br />
          <br />Combining more than 30 years’ experience in health care with
          in-depth research into the history and mythology of the divine
          feminine, Christine R. Page, M.D., reveals that women are the
          foundation of the birth of new levels of consciousness, without which
          the evolution of humanity will become barren and dry. Yet, such birth
          can occur only when women have the courage to reject the beliefs and
          images of the feminine imposed upon them four thousand years ago and
          reclaim their true identity. Through a fascinating journey into the
          body, Dr. Page shows the importance of self-love and self-respect and
          explains how sex is a natural process of unification where women take
          the lead, similar to the ancient sacred priestesses. Dr. Page reminds
          women to reconnect to the potent and creative energy of Mother Earth,
          which gives power to the intuitive voice of the heart and nurtures new
          seeds of inspiration and enlightenment through the womb.

          “In her book <i>The Healing Power of the Sacred Woman</i>, Christine
          R. Page, M.D., asks a question of timeless importance: ‘How do we
          really connect with the feminine essence?’ It’s clear she has also
          lived the question, in both ordinary and extraordinary ways, making
          this more than an ordinary book, but a pure expression of the search
          for the most authentic answer. You’ll discover insights and ancient
          wisdom on every page, because it is all within you, waiting for your
          inevitable embrace.”
