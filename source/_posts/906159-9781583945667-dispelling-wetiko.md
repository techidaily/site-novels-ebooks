          There is a contagious psychospiritual disease of the soul, a parasite
          of the mind, that is currently being acted out en masse on the world
          stage via a collective psychosis of titanic proportions. This
          mind-virus—which Native Americans have called "wetiko"—covertly
          operates through the unconscious blind spots in the human psyche,
          rendering people oblivious to their own madness and compelling them to
          act against their own best interests. <br /><br />Drawing on insights
          from Jungian psychology, shamanism, alchemy, spiritual wisdom
          traditions, and personal experience, author Paul Levy shows us that
          hidden within the venom of wetiko is its own antidote, which once
          recognized can help us wake up and bring sanity back to our society.

        <p>
          "This book brilliantly exposes how the very roots of the madness that
          is threatening life on earth are ultimately to be found within our own
          psyche. I love that Paul is taking seriously the profound implications
          of what it means that all of us are living in a mass, shared dream.
          His startlingly clear premise challenges me to reflect upon both the
          world and myself in radically mind-altering ways. Something important
          is coming through his imagination-filled musings; his visionary
          insight into the intrinsic genius of our species feels inspired by a
          truly creative, compassionate, and enlivening spirit. I always look
          forward to reading Paul's work; it stimulates me to greater heights of
          lucidity, disturbs me enough to awaken me out of my complacency, and
          encourages me to fly on the wings of the creative imagination. The
          world would be a better place if everyone read this book. His vision
          is a royal gift for all of us. It makes me want to sing. Bravo!"<br />—Sting<br /><br />"<i
            >Dispelling Wetiko</i
          >
          is one of those rare, courageous books that leads us where we would
          prefer not to go: into the depths of our own shadow. Yet this is the
          most essential journey for our present time.… It is a must-read,
          without a doubt."<br />—Caroline Myss, author of
          <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i><br /><br />"Paul Levy summons us by
          Wisdom's call to community, action, and our higher humanity. Truly
          initiatory, this book is inviting us to step through the looking glass
          and consciously participate in our own evolution. In exposing our
          psychic blindness, Levy is helping us to open our eyes and see."<br />—Thom
          Hartmann, author of <i>The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight</i
          ><br /><br />"When I read <i>Dispelling Wetiko,</i> I was unprepared
          for a work of such true brilliance and depth. Paul Levy should be
          congratulated on writing a seminal work."<br />—Brad Steiger, author
          of<i> Revelation: The Divine Fire</i><br /><br />"No one else writing
          in America today, in whatever genre, sees into the real nature of our
          crushing global endgame emergency more deeply, steadily, or wholly
          than Paul Levy."<br />—Eric Larsen, author of
          <i>A Nation Gone Blind</i> and professor emeritus at John Jay College
          of Criminal Justice (CUNY)<br /><br />"Paul Levy has broadened his
          hard-won personal insights into a trenchant diagnosis of the mass-mind
          psychosis afflicting our Western (and indeed now global) civilization.
          I honor Paul's courage and discernment in taking on this most elusive
          and treacherous of topics and showing the steps one can take to move
          toward liberation. <i>Dispelling Wetiko</i> deserves to be widely read
          and studied."<br />—Ralph Metzner, PhD, professor emeritus at the
          California Institute of Integral Studies and author of The Unfolding
          Self<br /><br />"I very much recommend Paul Levy's writings.
          Synthesizing a deep understanding of Jungian psychology and
          spirituality, his work brilliantly illuminates the dreamlike nature of
          reality."<br />—Dr. Arny Mindell, founder of process-oriented
          psychology and author of <i>The Shaman's Body</i><br /><br />"The
          world is suffering from the globalization of selfishness, materialism,
          and militarism, and Paul Levy, in his magnum opus,
          <i>Dispelling Wetiko, </i>identifies their roots in a cancer of the
          soul.… An insightful and provocative manifesto on how to combat this
          global epidemic before it is too late."<br />—Rabbi Michael Lerner,
          editor of <i>Tikkun</i> magazine, chair of the Interfaith Network of
          Spiritual Progressives, and author of <i>The Left Hand of God</i
          ><br /><br />"As a people, we seem to be seriously impaired. It is as
          if we have suffered a culture-wide stroke that has damaged the higher
          centers that control our ability to reason and act in rational ways.
          What will see us through? What will help us wake up from this slow
          suicide? Paul Levy's <i>Dispelling Wetiko</i> is a valuable step in
          the right direction. This desperately needed book not only sounds an
          alarm, but also points to a solution."<br />— Larry Dossey, MD, author
          of <i>The One Mind</i> and executive editor of
          <i>Explore: The Journal of Science and Healing</i><br /><br />"In
          these dire straits, many extraordinary people—in all walks of life,
          speaking in different tones and voices—envision the nondual experience
          of the nature of mind. Paul Levy is one of them. [He] evokes a clear
          and scintillating vision, resolving much of the incongruity of our
          existence."<br />—Keith Dowman, author of
          <i>Natural Perfection: Longchenpa's Radical Dzogchen</i
          ><br /><br />"Paul Levy hits the archetypal nail on the head when he
          identifies debt pushers, consumption pushers, and GOD (gold, oil, and
          drug) pushers as the cannibalistic offenders in today’s society.… I
          can’t express how brilliant I find this book."<br />—Iona Miller,
          coauthor of
          <i>The Modern Alchemist: A Guide to Personal Transformation</i
          ><br /><br />"This rich and fascinating book is full of original
          insights that challenge us to see the human predicament in a new
          way."<br />—Timothy Freke, author of <i>The Jesus Mysteries</i> and
          <i>The Mystery Experience</i><br /><br />"Paul Levy's provocative and
          insightful book <i>Dispelling Wetiko</i> shines a light on the
          darkness and exposes evil as an illusion—one that nonetheless impacts
          our reality. It is particularly important in these evolutionary times
          that those who see themselves as 'bringers of the light' understand
          the heart of darkness as well.… Kudos to Paul Levy for taking on this
          topic."<br />—Steve Bhaerman, coauthor of <i>Spontaneous Evolution</i
          ><br /><br />"Paul Levy is a great social critic and public
          intellectual—his distinctive metaphysical idealism and
          experience-based mysticism gives his oeuvre a spiritual depth that is
          lacking even among&nbsp; our best critical theorists. Unlike many
          other spiritually informed political activists, Paul’s spirituality is
          never saccharine or cliché, his politics never compromising. His
          profound psychological insights and treasure trove of metaphors and
          literary tropes enable him to advance a highly original theoretical
          perspective grounded in Jung’s thought, quantum physics, Buddhism and
          his own transpersonal revelations. His message to social activists is
          that the alternative to neoliberal barbarism and the advent of
          ecological catastrophe is the willingness to cultivate the power of
          the communal imagination…Paul Levy represents the future."<br />—Seth
          Farber, Ph.D., Assessing Editor,
          <i>The Journal of Mind and Behavior</i> and author of

            >The Spiritual Gift of Madness: The Failure of Psychiatry and the
            Rise of The Mad Pride Movement</i
          ><br /><br />"Paul Levy is one of the wisest, most
          spiritually-wide-awake people I've had the privilege of getting to
          know."<br />—Kevin Barrett, Truth Jihad Radio<br /><br />"Paul Levy is
          one of our time's most original thinkers on the human condition."
          <br />—Alan Steinfeld, NewRealities<br /><br />"Paul Levy's
          <i>Dispelling Wetiko</i> is among the very best books on the nature of
          evil that I have ever read, and because it offers a workable way out
          of the universal psychosis that native peoples call Wetiko, possibly
          the most important on the subject that I have had the pleasure of
          adding to my library. A real treasure."<br />—Whitley Strieber,
          UnknownCountry.com, Dreamland radio show<br /><br />"This volume, like
          its predecessor, is not only fascinating, riveting, and, like all
          Levy's work, consistently crunchy and prickly with thought, but it is
          also, in two words, overwhelmingly revelatory... A guarantee: Neither
          while reading nor after reading <i>Dispelling Wetiko</i> will you
          again look at the world around you the same way as you might have
          before."<br />—The Oliver Arts &amp; Open Press<br /><br />"Paul
          Levy's book is the finest recent example of what Jungian or archetypal
          criticism has to offer in the diagnosis of contemporary culture and,
          specifically, the problem of evil and how to find a way out of its
          dominance in our world."<br />—Walter Davis, author of

          Professor Emeritus in the Department of English at Ohio State
          University<br /><br />"Every so often a book comes into one's
          possession that dramatically and radically decimates one's world view.
          For me reading 'Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil' has
          been one of them."<br />—Peter Morris, LightoftheLogos.com,

          struggled to understand the manifestation of evil in our world. In

        </h4>
        <p>
          In 1981, Paul Levy&nbsp;experienced what his doctors considered to be
          a nervous breakdown. In actuality, it was a spiritual awakening, one
          that changed his life's path forever. Since 1993, he has been giving
          talks and facilitating groups to help others in the process of
          awakening from the collective dream. A Tibetan Buddhist practitioner
          for more than thirty years, he has intimately studied with some of the
          greatest spiritual masters of Tibet and Burma. The author lives in
          Portland, OR.
