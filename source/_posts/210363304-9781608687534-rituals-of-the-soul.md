          <strong>Prepare for a Great Adventure: Your Daily Life</strong><br />
          <br />
          Kori Hahn has always done life her way — living off the grid as a
          young woman in Alaska; studying with spiritual teachers and soul
          guides in Mexico, Sri Lanka, and Morocco; surfing around the world.
          Yet her primary, perennial quest has been an inner one. To that end,
          she evolved the practices she shares in this book, simple daily steps
          grounded in sacred yogic texts that will help you live your life your
          way, with maximum meaning and joy.<br />
          <br />
          Timeless principles of awareness, intuition, self-knowledge, and
          manifestation become contemporary practices incorporating
          visualization, breath work, journaling affirmations, and meditation.
          These habits of being grow the soul, enable our bravest and best
          selves, and, as Hahn shows, can take you wherever you most want to be.

          “Personal, grounded rituals become daily habits that create steadiness
          within, no matter what’s happening around you. Allow Kori Hahn to
          guide you toward creating practices that hold you every day.”<br />

          “Rituals of the Soul is a truly beautiful book. I felt an immediate
          connection to Kori Hahn and the way she takes you on a journey toward
          living your most abundant, authentic life through her story. Like
          Kori, I believe up-leveling your life is available to anyone. That
          living in flow with your life rather than against the current is
          within your reach. That in order to unlock your soul purpose, you must
          tune in to your inner wisdom and challenge yourself at every
          opportunity. As a fellow yogi and travel lover, I can appreciate the
          pictures she paints in each chapter. This guide to a modern and
          meaningful life will support you in clearing limiting blocks that stop
          you from living in your flow and finding your soul’s purpose.”<br />

          ><strong>, founder of Philosophie<br /> </strong><br />
          “Kori Hahn’s words are water for the dried desert flowers of this
          world wishing mightily to open their petals and be born again. This
          book contains eloquent and deep truths that the world has needed to
          hear for a long time.”<br />
          <strong>— Janne Robinson</strong
          ><strong>, CEO of This Is for the Women<br /> </strong><br />
          “This is the perfect book for intuitively connecting to the sacred
          rhythm of your life. With a deep understanding of both intuition and
          ritual, Kori Hahn masterfully guides you to create a unique personal
          practice for your soul’s purpose. Rituals of the Soul shows you how to
          find not just the way but your way — one breath at a time.”<br />
