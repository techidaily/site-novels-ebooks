          Psychedelics for spiritual, therapeutic, and problem-solving use
          <br />
          <br />• Presents practices for safe and successful psychedelic
          voyages, including the benefits of having a guide and how to be a
          guide <br />
          <br />• Reviews the value of psychedelics for healing and
          self-discovery as well as how LSD has facilitated scientific and
          technical problem-solving <br />
          <br />• Reveals how microdosing (ultr-low doeses) improve cognitive
          functioning, emotional balance, and physical stamina <br />
          <br />• This year 600,000 people in the U.S. alone will try LSD for
          the the first time, joining the 23 million who have already
          experimented with this substance <br />
          <br />Called “America’s wisest and most respected authority on
          psychedelics and their use,” James Fadiman has been involved with
          psychedelic research since the 1960s. In this guide to the immediate
          and long-term effects of psychedelic use for spiritual (high dose),
          therapeutic (moderate dose), and problem-solving (low dose and
          microdose) purposes, Fadiman outlines best practices for safe, sacred
          entheogenic voyages learned through his more than 40 years of
          experience--from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a
          session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and
          pre-session intention. <br />
          <br />Fadiman reviews the newest as well as the neglected research
          into the psychotherapeutic value of visionary drug use for increased
          personal awareness and a host of serious medical conditions, including
          his recent study of the reasons for and results of psychedelic use
          among hundreds of students and professionals. He reveals new uses for
          LSD and other psychedelics, including microdosing, extremely low
          doses, for improved cognitive functioning and emotional balance.
          Cautioning that psychedelics are not for everyone, he dispels the
          myths and misperceptions about psychedelics circulating in textbooks
          and clinics as well as on the internet. Exploring the life-changing
          experiences of Ram Dass, Timothy Leary, Aldous Huxley, and Huston
          Smith as well as Francis Crick and Steve Jobs, Fadiman shows how
          psychedelics, used wisely, can lead not only to healing but also to
          scientific breakthroughs and spiritual epiphanies.

          “Psychedelics have been part of native cultures for centuries and
          remain so in many areas of the world. Properly used, they offer a
          one-step guide to enlightenment and connection with intuition as well
          as the soul and the Divine. Dr. Fadiman’s book offers the best
          information and guidance available today. Everyone interested in
          exploring the world of inner consciousness will find this work
          indispensable.”
