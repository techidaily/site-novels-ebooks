          A Knock in the Attic: True Ghost Stories &amp; Other Spine-chilling
          Paranormal Adventures by John Russell is an engrossing, at times,
          disturbing nonfiction book in which the author narrates his
          supernatural experiences. At the tender age of five, John had his
          first encounter with a black ghost. The image of the old black man's
          face peering around one of the doorways from down the hall will always
          stay with him, and he refers to it as "the harbinger of the beginning"
          of his psychic, mediumistic, paranormal life, a life lived at the edge
          of the Veil which separates the seen and unseen worlds. This book is
          composed of stories that detail paranormal occurrences and experiences
          involving those who have passed on to another life. John has had
          run-ins with spirits, developed healing powers, and been saved by
          angels. His incredible experiences with the otherworldly creatures are
          recounted in this book, and they are stunning. This is a book that is
          filled with adventure and mind-blowing experiences, and the author
          provides ample proof that there is life beyond death, that those who
          have died still have the power to influence us, that the universe is a
          mystery that is bigger than our physical world. John Russell might
          have had and still has extraordinary experiences, but he also has the
          gift of storytelling which allows him to communicate his adventures in
          prose that is crisp and in a voice that is irresistible. A Knock in
          the Attic: True Ghost Stories &amp; Other Spine-chilling Paranormal
          Adventures is a book that will entertain fans of the paranormal, but
          more importantly, it is one that will make any reader question
          existence and change what they think they know about life beyond the
          tomb. I was mesmerized by the writing and enamored by the experiences
          the author shares in this book. Reviewed By Grace Masso for Readers'
