            Finding the Right Direction for Success in Life was birthed from my
            life's journey of going through the motion of finding what I believe
            was my calling in life. It is my hope that as you follow along on
            the journey with me through some of my unpleasant experiences, you
            will see the importance of why you must keep moving in the right
            direction for success no matter what comes your way. During the
            sharing of these experiences, I desire to enlighten you on how to
            stay at the course that will lead you to your success.
          </p>

            My story details the injustices that I had to face as a young, Black
            man. Among others, it also details my teenage experiences of having
            my life threatened because of the color of my skin. In addition, you
            will get a glimpse of the many naysayers that I faced along the path
            to success who intentionally placed roadblocks and potholes in an
            effort to steer me off track.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            During the course of this journey, I have been thrown many curve
            balls. Losing many mentors that have impacted my life have been more
            impactful. These were hard to overcome because I had to face some of
            them head-on at a young age. At one point, you will read about me
            having no desire to do right or head in the right direction for
            success. The struggles were real, and many times the view leading to
            the right direction were obscured. You will see how I attached my
            painful past to something that was so real that it propelled me in
            the right direction to become an overcomer.
          </p>

          <p>
            Make it a great read as you walk with me from poverty to success!
            Hear my heartfelt story that may be just a key to leading you in a
            successful direction.
