          <p>
            In our world today, we hear so many hollow words. Words that mean
            nothing. Words that we are not certain are truthful. Words that try
            to impress us and others. Words that are weak and powerless. We hear
            words that are negative and legalistic. I certainly hope the words
            in this book are not meaningless, empty, and negative. I have
            intended for the words to bring you peace, love, and insight. I want
            these words to bring you hope and joy. They are intended for you to
            live a more fulfilled life. I hope you will find this book to be
            just what you needed to hear. It is not because I have wisdom,
            however; I have prayed that the Lord would use these words to be
            helpful and encouraging. If you have been wounded, I hope you will
            find these words of comfort. If you have experience prolonged
            struggles, I hope you will find God is looking after you and wants
            to give you comfort and peace. If your life is at the crossroad and
            you need to make a decision to what is right or wrong, please do
            what is right, not just what feels right to you. If you are the
            person who believes that you are unlovable, I hope you find insight
            in this book about how deeply the Lord loves you and wants a
            relationship with you. If you do not believe in miracles, I hope you
            might after reading about a few miracles in my life. What are your
            friendships like? I will share my relationship with just a few of my
            wonderful friend. Oh my goodness, they offer forgiveness for my
            weaknesses.Do you want to grow old gracefully? I sure do, however;
            after putting on a little age and going through a few storms on this
            journey, it can be challenging. I will share a few of my insights
            with you.My prayer is this book will be refreshing to you. Hopefully
            you will be encouraged during the tough seasons in your life. Please
            know, that I do not claim to have all the answers. Many people have
            blessed me with their insight and I would like to share them with
            you. I want you to have a wonderful and happy life. A life filled
            with goodness and joy. May the words in this book bless you.
