          A practical guide to the celebration of Beltaine and the sacred herbs
          of spring <br /><br />• Explores the identification, harvest, and safe
          practical and ritual use of more than 90 plants and trees
          <br /><br />• Details rituals for honoring the traditional Gods and
          Goddesses of spring, such as the Goddess Chloris, the Goddess Flora,
          and the Daghda <br /><br />• Reveals which herbs to use for luck,
          magic, protection, purification, abundance, fertility, and love as
          well as the herbs of the Faeries and Elves and herbs for journeying to
          the Otherworld and for contacting the High Gods and Goddesses
          <br /><br />The festival of Beltaine, May Day, is a celebration of the
          return of spring and the promise of summer, a time for love magic and
          spells for increasing the fertility of the land and the plants that
          grow upon it. Like Samhain in autumn, Beltaine is also a time when the
          veil between the physical and spiritual world is at its most
          transparent and the ancestors and denizens of the Otherworld easily
          interact with the world of humans. <br /><br />Presenting a practical
          guide to the celebration of Beltaine, Ellen Evert Hopman examines the
          plants, customs, foods, drinks, and rituals of May Day across many
          cultures. Discussing the gods and goddesses of spring, Hopman details
          the rituals for honoring them as well as traditional poems, prayers,
          incantations, folk rhymes, and sayings related to this time of year.
          She explores well dressing, the custom of honoring the source of
          sacred water by decorating a well. She also looks at Beltaine’s
          association with Walpurgisnacht and Hexennacht, which fall the
          preceding evening. <br /><br />In the extensive section on the sacred
          plants of Beltaine, the author explores more than 90 herbs and trees,
          offering spells, rituals, and recipes alongside their medicinal
          healing uses. She reveals sacred woods suitable for the Beltaine fires
          and Beltaine flowers for rituals and spells. She explores herbs for
          luck, magic, purification, abundance, and love; herbs for protection,
          such as bindweed, elder, and St. John’s wort; herbs of the Faeries and
          Elves, such as burdock and dandelion; and herbs for journeying to the
          Otherworld and contacting the high gods and goddesses. She also
          details the identification, harvest, and preparation of seasonal
          edible herbs, greens, mushrooms, and flowers. <br /><br />Woven
          throughout with mystical tales of folk, Faery, and sacred herbs, this
          guide offers each of us practical and magical ways to connect with
          Nature, the plant kingdom, and the Spirits that surround us in the
          season of spring.
