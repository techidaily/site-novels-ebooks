          An exploration of shamanism and the archetypal symbolism that sits at
          the foundation of all human life<br /><br />• Not just an academic
          work. Helps the reader experience the actual mindset of the shaman<br /><br />•
          Presents a cohesive view of the recurrent patterns of symbolism and
          visionary experience that underlie all religion<br /><br />The human
          psyche contains archetypal patterns largely lost to contemporary
          society but which shamans have employed for over 30,000 years to gain
          access to the spiritual world. Shamanic symbols both affect and
          reflect these durative patterns that exist, with uncanny similarity,
          in civilizations separated by expanses of time and distance.
          <i>The Strong Eye of Shamanism</i> draws together the many facets of
          the art of shamanism, presenting a cohesive view of the recurrent
          patterns of symbolism and visionary experience that underlie its
          practice. <br /><br />The "strong eye" of the title refers to the
          archetypal symbolism that sits at the foundation of all human
          life--whether in Paleolithic caves or today's temples. The author
          asserts that society has become separated from the power of those
          symbols that lead us into deeper understanding of our spirituality. In
          today's world of splintered psyches, a world in which people are in
          search of their souls, shamanism survives as an age-old technology of
          soul recovery, a living Rosetta stone that reminds us of the shared
          foundation that exists beneath even the most radically different
          perspectives. Through its study of shamanism, archetypal psychology,
          and symbolism, <i>The Strong Eye of Shamanism</i> encourages
          individuals--and society--to look inward and remember that the deepest
          forms of awareness begin with the knowledge that the answers reside
          within us.

            >The Strong Eye of Shamanism: A Journey into the Caves of
            Consiousness </i
          >is a well-researched and lucidly written interpretive analysis of
          certain archetypal shamanic journey themes found in the Paleolithic
          rock art caves of southwestern France and northern Spain. Weaving
          together archaeological research on European cave art, the archetypal
          approaches of Jungian psychology and comparative symbology, and
          ethnographic studies of shamanic initiation ceremonies in various
          cultures, author Robert E. Ryan carefully develops his thesis that
          these Paleolithic caves may have functioned as ritual
          sanctuaries--natural cathedrals that may have been used for shamanic
          initiations or for some other shamanic purposes. <br /><br />Through
          the process of examining a sampling of accounts of shamanic initiatory
          journeys recorded in shamanic cultures around the world (including the
          Samoyed of Siberia, the Aborigine of Australia, the Maya of Central
          America, the Huichol of Mexico, and the Tukano of the Amazon), Ryan
          does a good job of identifying many of the primary themes inherent in
          shamanic trance journeys. For example, utilizing Reichel-Dolmatoff's
          ethnographic research on the Tukano, he ably traces the archetypal
          structural forms and motifs--such as feather crowns, feathered staffs,
          and images of drowning and returning to the cosmic womb of
          creation--that permeate Tukano shamanic practices and cosmological
          myths. Drawing on the research of Peter Furst and Barbara Myerhoff, he
          performs a similar analysis on archetypal themes involved in the
          Huichol pilgrimage to Wirikuta, the holy homeland of peyote.
          <br /><br />Ryan endeavors to show that the physical journey into the
          Paleolithic caves of Europe . . . essentially reenacts the classic
          shamanic journey into the underworld and that the content and
          placement of images in the caves reflects the most fundamental and
          universal patterns of shamanic initiation.<br /><br />This volume
          contains much stimulating and thought-provoking material that should
          be of interest to shamanic practitioners.
