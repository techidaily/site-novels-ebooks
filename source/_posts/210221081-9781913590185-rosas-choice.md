              >Rosa's Choice: Healing the Wounds of the Mother, offers a
              fascinating behind the scenes peek into life before life. It
              reveals the choices made by spirit babies, why they choose not to
              come just yet, why they choose not to stay. And why your journey
              to motherhood is part of your soul healing journey. The book also
              reveals how there is a wave of new souls here and waiting to
              arrive, who together with their parents and life guides, are
              playing a much bigger role in building a New Earth. This book is
              therefore not only for women on their journey to motherhood, but
              for all those whose role it is to support them, their babies and
              Mother Earth herself.

              the spirit baby realm and Divine Masters on the energy of creation
              and the imbalance between the feminine and masculine. It also
              examines very practically the various thought patterns and beliefs
              that affect the way we see, feel and experience life, including
              the journey to motherhood, and how to transform them.

            In my eyes, Rosa is my baby soul in spirit, who I said a
            heart-breaking hello and goodbye to on 5th December 2010, in a
            life-changing moment of choice. I had no idea at the time, in my
            sense of unworthiness, victimhood and grief, that she was so much
            more than that; that I was so much more than that. That life,
            before, whilst here and after, is so much more than that.

              specialist, channel, healer and spiritual guide. Debra supports
              women on their journey to motherhood, whether they are struggling
              to conceive, have experienced baby loss or a traumatic birth.
              Debra's own challenging journey to motherhood through birth
              trauma, three miscarriages and a medical termination catapulted
              her into her spiritual awakening and discovering her life purpose.
              Her Soul's contract is to bring women, their babies and future
              babies together. To heal the deep wounds of the Mother and the
              Divine Feminine within this lifetime and others. Through deep,
              loving inner exploration, Debra guides women to transform their
              perception and understanding of themselves and their journey, to
              move from a place of questioning and pain to one of freedom,
              self-awareness, belief and empowerment. To knowing themselves as
              loving and powerful creators of life with the ability to hold and
              birth the energy of new life. Debra works alongside spirit babies
              to help their mums see themselves as they see them - love.
