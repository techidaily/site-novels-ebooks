          Is it just a coincidence that a record number of people are seeing in
          numbers, or could it be the fabric of the universe revealing itself to
          us? According to the religion of Kabbalah and even the ancient Greek
          philosopher and mathematician Pythagoras, the truths of the universe
          are contained within numbers.<br /><br />
          The phenomena of numbers—seeing repeating numbers and number
          sequences—are sweeping the globe. People from the average Joe to
          celebrities are seeing repeating numbers on clocks, in addresses, in
          phone numbers, in account numbers, and on license plates, just to name
          a few. Repeating numbers and number sequences are showing up in both
          the quirky and the commonplace on a daily basis.<br /><br />
          Skeptics argue that seeing repeating numbers is simply a matter of
          pattern recognition and it’s all in our head. There have been
          scientific theories throughout history that attempt to explain the
          basis of the universal structure—from String Theory to the Holographic
          universe. All things in existence can be counted, sorted, or measured
          using numbers and, intriguingly, a common thread in many theories is
          mathematics.<br /><br />
          More people are reporting the same phenomena in all cultures, races,
          and religions, turning skeptics into believers.&nbsp;<i
            >Soul Numbers</i
          >&nbsp;has the potential to create a tidal wave amid this numbers
          phenomenon, making it the new, most complete numbers-meaning bible.<br /><br />
          Numerology books offer some insight into the base number meanings of 0
          to 9 but fail to go further to precisely pinpoint and explain why
          someone is seeing 1:47 on a clock daily and what it means to them.
          Covering the number meanings from 0 to 999,<i>&nbsp;Soul Numbers</i
          >&nbsp;helps readers decipher any number sequence. Whether they’re
          seeing single 2s everywhere or exactly four—2222—it will allow them to
          break the numbers down like an ancient code. Unlike other titles with
          mainly angelic-focused number meanings, this book holds a broad
          spectrum view of number patterns, weaving science and spirituality to
          spark the curiosity of both the skeptic and the die-hard spiritualist.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Michelle Arbeau is an internationally known celebrity numerologist,
          inspirational speaker, and radio and TV host. She has a clientele base
          that stretches around the globe, with clients ranging from those
          seeking purpose and direction to successful professionals and
          celebrities wanting to fine-tune their careers and personal lives.
          Some of her celebrity clientele
          include&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i>&nbsp;vampires Judi Shekoni and Amadou
          Ly,&nbsp;<i>Big Bang Theory</i>&nbsp;actress Alice Amter, NBC director
          Ricky Powell,&nbsp;<i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>&nbsp;actor Treva
          Etienne,&nbsp;<i>A League of their Own</i>&nbsp;actress Lori Petty,
          and celebrity stylist Carrie White. A media favorite who is considered
          an expert in her field, she is frequently a guest on national media
          outlets such as CBC Radio, CTV&nbsp;<i>Morning Live</i>, and&nbsp;<i
            >Breakfast Television</i
          >. She has spoken on a wide range of topics from Friday the 13th to
          predicting Obama’s re-election.<br /><br />Arbeau’s love of numbers
          and numerology happened in a very synchronistic way. After a
          near-death experience at the age of four, she began to experience
          psychic phenomena that continued throughout her early life. Lacking
          guidance and support, she pushed her premonitions and intuitive
          information aside until her early twenties, when she suddenly began
          dreaming in numbers every single night. Knowing these were messages
          from the spiritual realm, she sought out their meaning on the
          Internet. Stumbling upon numerology, she discovered that the messages
          were direct answers to her life issues. Amazed by the accuracy of the
          numerical messages, Arbeau began a love affair with the world of
          numbers. She now teaches Power of Numbers workshops in venues
          throughout North America, from New York City to Los Angeles, and also
          shares her knowledge of numbers in private client sessions.<br />
