            >Harness the power of your unconscious through dream incubation: an
            age-old technique to access hidden wisdom and receive instruction
            through your dreams.</b
          ><br /><br />Everyone dreams-both literally and metaphorically-but
          most people don't know that their dreams can be used for personal
          development. Therapist, dream expert, and founder of the Jung Society
          of Utah and the Jung Platform Machiel Klerk shares how, through dream
          incubation, you can manifest the life of your dreams just by
          cultivating an intimate relationship with your own dreams and taking
          the guidance you receive from your subconscious. If you ask the right
          question and keep an open mind, your dream will give you an answer.
          Klerk offers an easy, actionable five-step process to help you have an
          incubation dream, a dream that reveals the answer to your question.<br /><br />1.
          Identify the problem and decide that you'd like to ask your dream for
          help.<br />2. Develop a question that relates directly to the issue
          for which you are seeking answers.<br />3. Engage in a ritual aimed to
          enhance the dream response, like meditation.<br />4. Sleep, and upon
          waking, immediately record your dream or dreams.<br />5. Reflect on
          the dream and determine the "lesson" it offered.

          “In this very accessible book, Machiel Klerk explains the brass tacks
          of dream incubation. The how-to and the why, the history and the
          ancestry. Dream incubation gives us access to healing and creativity.
          It was just waiting for a simple—though not simplistic—guide. Here it
          is.”<br />
          — Robert Bosnak, author of <i>A Little Course in Dreams</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Dream Guidance</i> offers an easy, open, and effective approach to

          to connect with dreaming and your deeper self, try these incubation

          — Robert Waggoner, author of <i>Lucid Dreaming</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Dreams respond as oracles, offering guidance to one of life’s most
          precious treasures—the Soul. Few know the ways of connecting to these
          oracular powers. Machiel Klerk offers<br />
          a step-by-step process of asking the focused questions that unleash
          the guiding wisdom of dreams. This book breaks new ground, opens new
          possibilities, speaks to the heart and soul. It is a must-read for
          those following the way of the dream.”<br />
          — Dr. Stephen Aizenstat, Ph.D., founder of Pacifica Graduate Institute
          and Dream Tending<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Dream Guidance</i> offers a rich resource of ideas and practices
          for incubating, working with, and learning from dreams. Machiel Klerk
          serves as a knowing guide as he draws knowledge from ancient practices
          and Indigenous healers to psychology and his own compelling insights
          into the wondrous realm of dreams.”<br />
          — Michael Meade, author of <i>Awakening the Soul</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Machiel Klerk has written a remarkable book on dreams. You will learn
          much from him how to make dreams a part of life. The book is clear and
          lively and doesn’t get stuck in minor arguments and subtle theories.
          It’s an adventure. You need to make dreams a part of your daily life,
          and this book is a helpful guide and inspiration.”<br />
          — Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “How do you live your Soul’s call? This beautiful, engaging book
          offers guidance for tapping into the deep wisdom dreams offer each
          night. Put it by your bedside, and it will change your life.”<br />
          — Tina Stromsted, Ph.D., LMFT, director of the Soul’s Body Center<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Machiel Klerk has been exploring the dream world for over 25 years.
          His deep and sustained interest in the dreamscape has come together in
          this book, which will help you to connect and explore your own dreams
          and their meanings. With Machiel’s experienced guidance, you will
          learn to allow your dreams to inform, reveal, and enhance your
          life.”<br />
          — Diane Musho Hamilton, author of <i>Compassionate Conversations</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Learning the language of dreams and their wise and holy power to
          guide us into our most authentic life is a great source of joy and
          wisdom. In this beautifully written, wise, and original book, Machiel
          Klerk draws on the wide variety of world traditions and his own deep
          experience to offer a new way of working with our dreams—and a way to
          light up our waking lives.”<br />
          — Andrew Harvey, author of <i>The Hope</i> and <i>Engoldenment</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Dreams are wise friends, and they wish to help us. With illuminating
          examples and a lively mix of cultural traditions and history,
          <i>Dream Guidance</i> leads readers step-by-step into the ancient and
          highly practical art of dream incubation. By emphasizing the power of
          ritual and the art of asking the right question, Machiel Klerk guides
          readers to their inner wisdom.”<br />
          — Dr. Clare Johnson, author of <i>The Art of Lucid Dreaming</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In the introduction to <i>Dream Guidance,</i> Machiel Klerk describes
          how when he was lost, dreams helped him find his way home. That
          homecoming has been an ongoing journey that is now presented in this
          fascinating, wise, and practical guide through the five steps of dream
          incubation. It is especially relevant in today’s perilous times, when
          collectively we need the wisdom of dreams to chart a way home.”<br />
          — Robert D. Romanyshyn, Ph.D., author of
          <i>Victor Frankenstein, the Monster and the Shadows of Technology</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In Machiel Klerk’s dream work, questioning is like open-heart
          surgery, where the human heart is eager to open if the instrument of
          the right question is implemented. With dream incubation: ask the
          right question and prepare for unforeseen surprises!”<br />
          — Dennis Patrick Slattery, author of <i>The Way of Myth</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Dream Guidance</i> is a small but powerful gem. Machiel Klerk has
          devoted much of his life to gleaning the wisdom found within this book
          from many traditions. This book is a most helpful guide to those
          seeking to engage the dreaming psyche in search of soul.”<br />
          — Joseph Cambray, Ph.D., author of <i>Synchronicity</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Machiel Klerk understands that dreams are not only apertures into the
          mystery within each of us but also summonses generated by the soul to
          engage consciousness. He has assembled a rich collection of ideas,
          tools, and examples showing how to open a dialogue within and be
          guided by that source which knows us better than we know
          ourselves.”<br />
          — James Hollis, Ph.D., author of <i>The Broken Mirror</i>
