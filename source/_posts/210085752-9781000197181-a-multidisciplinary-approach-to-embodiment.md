            This is a collection of pithy and accessible essays on the nature
            and implications of human embodiment which explore the concept of
            ‘human being’ in the most unprecedented manner through seemingly
            disparate academic disciplines.
          </p>
          <p>
            With contributions from key researchers from around the world, this
            book engages with embodiment through the lens of "new materialism".
            It eschews the view that human beings are debased by materiality and
            creates a vision of humans as fully embodied creatures situated in a
            richly populated living planet. The essays in this volume will
            illustrate and foster new materialist thought in areas including
            psychology, astrophysics, geology, biology, sociology, philosophy,
            and the performing arts. The book’s engaging and enlightening
            content is made accessible to readers with relatively little
            background in the various academic disciplines.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is an important and fascinating text which invites readers to
            explore and expand their understanding and experience of embodiment.
            It will be particularly useful for postgraduate students and
            scholars of theoretical and philosophical psychology, philosophy of
            the mind, and social and cultural anthropology.

            >"A decade ago, I thought I was being radically inclusive when I
            wrote an essay entitled, ‘Embodiment as a unifying perspective for
            psychology.’ But this delightfully readable volume of short essays
            greatly expands the embodiment program by documenting contributions
            of embodiment to anthropology, biology, communication, education,
            gender studies, geology, kinesiology, performing arts, philosophy,
            physics, political science, psychology, and sociology. I recommend
            it to all who are interested in human being."</strong

          "This collection of essays takes up the difficult challenge of
          approaching embodied existence from different perspectives while
          breaking away from the domination by the usual viewpoints. A very
          welcome opening up of the wealth of perspectives, with the unifying
          ambition to bring out the multifaceted character of the embodied human
          life." --

          will have much to teach anyone interested in embodiment." --

          "A Multidisciplinary Approach to Embodiment: Understanding Human Being
          stands out from the crowd. This highly original collection achieves
          true interdisciplinarity, bringing together contributions from the
          social sciences, humanities, and biomedical sciences to summarize
          current thinking on body, mind and world, from multiple perspectives."

            >"Embodiment is a topic that has greatly influenced the recent
            multidisciplinary study of human minds. Nancy Dess's new edited book
            offers a vivid, fresh look at the ways embodiment unfolds within
            many forms of human action and meaning-making. Embodiment is not
            just the brain or the biological body, but a dynamic organization
            that includes brains and bodies interacting with the cultural,
            historical world in the service of adaptive action. These essays are
            all a delight to read and offer many new insights into the ways
            embodiment defines who we are as unique human beings in shared
            worlds of embodied inter-subjectivity."</strong
