          The author team that wrote the upcoming Skyhorse title
          <i>Edison vs. Tesla</i>, as well as
          <i>The Haunting of the Presidents</i> and other titles about the
          weird, the supernatural, and the unexplained, turn their attention to
          the oval office for a unique view of UFOs in America and more
          specifically, what America's presidents--from Washington to
          Obama--have witnessed and believed.<br /><br />Most of us know that
          George Washington was heavily involved with the secret society the
          Freemasons. But how many of us know about George Washington's UFO
          sighting during the terrible winter at Valley Forge, and how the
          experience guided his future?Marilyn Monroe is rumored to have had UFO
          intel that she gained via pillow-talk from JFK.Under Nixon's
          presidency we orbited and walked upon the surface the moon while
          almost at the same time the Air Force was exploiting the Air Force as
          scientific cover for its decision to terminate Project Blue Book.
          Jimmie Carter was visited by UFOs multiple times.
          <i>UFOs and the White House</i> is an oft-overlooked glimpse at
          history that will appeal to historians as well as advocates of the
          paranormal.

          "This fascinating history of the UFO phenomenon in the United States
          is told through the clever mechanism of breaking events down by
          presidency, and then analyzing not just the sightings themselves, but
          the intriguing question of what various presidents believed or knew
          about UFOs. Meticulously researched and data-rich, Birnes and Martin
          have produced a work that is both scholarly and eminently readable." –
          <b>Nick Pope, UK Ministry of Defense UFO Project, retired</b><br />
          “From Valley Forge to the 2016 election, Birnes and Martin cover
          stories about UFOs and presidents ranging from obscure historical
          references to presidents – and presidential candidates – discussing
          UFOs and aliens on recent late night talk shows. Birnes is known for
          bringing controversial UFO accounts to light that forever change the
          historical record on the topic of UFOs and the accounts in this book
          are equally as fascinating." –

          "Encompassing a time period from ‘ancient of days’ right up to
          yesterday, and maybe even tomorrow, the authors present well-known UFO
          sightings that various presidents could have known about and wanted to
          tell the people but were warned not to by secret agencies...A lot to
          think about in this book!” –

          “Birnes and Martin have painstakingly chronicled all of the
          significant, well-documented instances where US commanders in chief,
          presidential candidates, and future presidents have either confessed
          to having seen unexplained lights in the sky, expressed concern about
          UFO-incursions into sensitive airspace, or had knowledge as to their
          origin.” –

          “Bill and Joel show that the story goes much further back than Kenneth
          Arnold or Roswell, and that the American Presidency has played a
          significant role. I've been studying Ufology for years and I learned a
          lot. Simply put, if you are interested in UFOs you must buy this
          book!” – <b>Jim Harold, host of the <i>Paranormal Podcast</i></b

          "My good friend, Bill Birnes has done it again - written an important
          expose' book on a subject that I never thought of doing but wish I
          had. No matter what aspect of the UFO phenomenon you are interested
          in, this book is a real page-turning, eye-opener on a mystery that has
          reached (and still reaches) all the way to the highest office in our
          land." -<b>Tom Carey</b>, Roswell Investigator, Co-author of
