            >“A clear, accessible, and forthright exploration of Celtic
            tradition as the foundation of a personal path of mystical
            transformation.” —John Michael Greer, former Grand Archdruid,
            Ancient Order of Druids in America, and author of
            <i>The Druidry Handbook</i></b
          ><br /><br />The Druids were the mystics, philosophers, and magicians
          of the ancient Celtic world. Their spirituality was borne from their
          near-worship of poetry and music, their warrior prowess, and the world
          of nature. <i>The Mysteries of Druidry</i> reveals this mystical
          romanticism as it was in ancient times, and shows various ways to
          bring it to life today. It includes:A professionally researched survey
          of Druidic history, tradition, and customsDetailed descriptions of the
          mysteries of Celtic spirituality, including the Sacred Truth, the
          Great Marriage, the Hero’s Journey, and the OtherworldPractical
          guidance for meditation and ceremony, for individuals and for
          groupsThe Celtic story of the creation of the world, presented
          together with a plan for re-enacting the story in ritual<br /><br />“An
          exemplary look at one man’s approach to Druidism, with excellent food
          for thought and suggestions for group ritual and personal
          practice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. His personal stories of working with and
          discovering the spirits of the land are inspiring and useful guides to
          the readers.” —Erynn Laurie, author of <i>A Circle of Stones</i>,
          cofounder of the Inis Glas Hedge School<br /><br />“With gentle
          clarity, [Myers] writes not only of myth, folklore, and Celtic
          history, but also of and for our Celtic present. With his words, he
          inspires, calling the reader to breathe in the songs of the ancestors,
          and so to sing those songs with both a celebratory pride and a
          profound relevance for today.” —Emma Restall Orr, Joint Chief of the
          British Druid Order; author of <i>Kissing the Hag</i>

          "An excellent study of the way in which Druid spirituality can inspire
          and help us today."<br /><br />"Despite the flurry of books on Celtic
          spirituality in recent years, very little has seen print that combines
          a solid foundation in Celtic tradition and scholarship with practical
          guidance for those who hope to follow a living Celtic spiritual path
          in today's world. Brendan Cathbad Myers' The Mysteries of Druidry
          fills that void admirably, with a clear, accessible, and forthright
          exploration of Celtic tradition as the foundation of a personal path
          of mystical transformation that's profoundly relevant to the problems
          and possibilities of the modern world. This is a book I would be
          delighted to recommend to my students, to members of my Druid order,
          and to anyone interested in Celtic spirituality as a living path for
          today."<br /><br />"Few books on Druidry successfully blend the
          intellectual, the emotional, and the spiritual aspects to create a
          truly representative work on Celtic mysteries. The Mysteries of
          Druidry is one of these books. It is clearly written by someone who
          has practical experience in Druidry, making it one of the most
          enjoyable, inspirational, informative, and beautiful books on the
          subject."
