            >“Guaranteed to give immense hope,” this manual on reconnecting with
            deceased loved ones “provides stunning evidence of the continuity of
            love and life” (Suzanne Giesemann, author of
            <i>Messages of Hope</i>)</b
          ><br /><br />
          Famed relationship therapist, author, and media personality&nbsp;Dr.
          Jamie Turndorf—known worldwide as Dr. Love—shares the amazing true
          story of her spiritual reconnection with her beloved, deceased
          husband, internationally renowned former Jesuit priest Emile Jean Pin.
          Discovering for herself that relationships don’t end in death, Jamie
          recounts her remarkable experience where, through the depths of her
          grief after Jean’s sudden passing, her husband made his continued
          presence—and undying love—known.<br /><br />
          Drawing on these personal encounters, Jamie has created a
          groundbreaking new form of grief therapy that combines her acclaimed
          conflict-resolution techniques with after-death communication. The
          result: an unprecedented method that enables the bereaved to
          reconnect, resolve unfinished business, and make peace with the
          deceased.<br /><br />
          Filled with dozens of examples of spirit contact and communication,
          this book eliminates any doubt about life after death and shows that
          contact is ongoing. Loved ones in spirit don’t just linger briefly
          before going to “heaven” and disappearing from your life. Rather,
          heaven is a state, not a place, and your loved ones have eternity to
          support you and heal any issues left behind when they passed on.<br /><br />
          Come to recognize the numerous signs from spirit that you may have
          been missing. Learn to trust yourself and the process that’s right for
          you—not a shortened, artificial grief period prescribed by
          conventional doctors. Practice techniques for heightening your senses,
          expanding your awareness, and entering an open state, culminating in
          Jamie’s method for Dialoguing with the Departed.<br /><br />
          When connection and love live on, fear is banished and relationships
          can grow and heal as never before. Begin opening your mind and your
          heart today!

          "When we experience loss, we need good therapy, which you’re providing
          in Love Never Dies. Your new therapeutic techniques are amazing! You
          show us the way to heal our hearts and find lasting love."<br />—John
          Gray, Ph.D.,&nbsp;#1 New York Times best-selling author of Men Are
          from Mars, Women Are from Venus<br /><br />"Dr. Turndorf has written a
          remarkably moving chronicle of her own life, and uses it as a
          spiritually insightful guide to effectively help others. The art form
          for spirit communication, described in this book, will not only make
          it possible for you to connect with departed loved ones, but will also
          bring true harmony into your everyday life."<br />—Dannion Brinkley,
          New York Times best-selling author of Saved by the Light<br /><br />"We
          have never seen anything like Dr. Turndorf’s Trans-Dimensional Grief
          Therapy Method."<br />— Reid Tracy, CEO and President of Hay House
          Publishing<br /><br />"Dr. Turndorf’s eternal love story powerfully
          proves that our loved ones in spirit are waiting for us to reconnect
          with them! Read this amazing book and discover her new dialoguing
          technique, which enables you to reconnect and turn grief into peace
          and joy."<br />—Mira Kelley, best-selling author of Beyond Past
          Lives<br /><br />"Dr. Turndorf's extraordinary memoir/self-help book
          provides astonishing proof that we don't die and that we are meant to
          reconnect and stay connected to loved ones in spirit. Read this book,
          learn her powerful new method for reconnecting and making peace with
          the deceased, and you will transform your grief to joy."<br />—Fr.
          Richard Rohr, Founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation
          (CAC), and best-selling author of Falling Upward<br /><br />"I found
          the book very helpful in guiding people to learn how to tune in to
          spirit messages, and particularly liked Dr. Turndorf’s guidance
          through meditations. In Parts 2 and 3, Dr. Turndorf covered so many of
          the ways that spirits convey messages, and this book will be a great
          help for people trying to get in touch with their loved ones.<br />"Part
          1 was her story of losing the love of her life. Reading about the pain
          and agony she experienced and SO MANY people experience will be
          healing to know that others experience the same emotions after the
          passing of a loved one.&nbsp;I think the first part could be a book on
          its own merit because it is so beneficial to people dealing with the
          same intensity of grief.<br />"As a scientist myself, I was glad to
          read that she didn’t focus on a religion. As a medium, I have come to
          know that ‘god’ is not of a religion, but is the consciousness of all
          living things. Like Dr. Turndorf I’ve learned that all people are
          equal and all creatures part of all existence (and with ‘souls.’).<br />"I
          particularly enjoyed reading how she used her talent/mediumship to
          help people overcome their grief. Readers will get a lot out of this
          book and know that their loved ones are always connected."<br />—Rob
          Gutro, Author, Medium, NASA Scientist<br /><br />"I could not put this
          book down!!! It is so gripping from the first few words, and
          beautifully written. Dr. Turndorf’s courageous story of her reunion
          with her beloved husband after his death and the heartfelt stories of
          others serve to validate what many may have privately experienced but
          discounted as just a by-product of grief and loss and not really
          ‘REAL.’ The book’s simple and powerful techniques provide essential
          tools for connecting to loved ones in spirit, and will allow
          scientists to amass new data from laypeople, other than mediums. Your
          book will make a profound contribution to the now-significant
          scientific data already collected in laboratories around the world
          studying survival of individual consciousness after death, while
          adding richly to our own sense of love and peace. Thank you for the
          Gift!"<br />—Linda G. Russek, Ph.D., Former Co-founder and Co-director
          of the Human Energy Systems Laboratory, University of Arizona,
          Co-author of The Living Energy Universe<br /><br />"This is the most
          beautiful true love story that I have ever read. The depth of the
          author’s love for her husband and her terrible grief at his death, and
          then her triumph as she learned to continue her relationship with him
          even after his death, are all palpable. I lived it with her, and her
          story has stayed in my mind. For me, though, the reason to read this
          book is the author’s wisdom in teaching her readers how to heal rifts
          across the death boundary. As one who has done extensive afterlife
          research, I can attest to the importance of post-death healing of
          relationships to both our dead loved ones and ourselves! Yet few
          people know how essential this healing is, and fewer still know how to
          begin it. As a prominent relationship counselor, Dr. Turndorf tackles
          this essential area, and she does it well. Hers is a wonderful
          book."<br />—Roberta Grimes, Author of The Fun of Dying: Find Out What
          Really Happens Next and The Fun of Staying in Touch<br /><br />"Exceptionally
          well written from beginning to end, Love Never Dies: How to Reconnect
          and Make Peace with the Deceased is as informed and informative as it
          is inspired and inspiring. Especially recommended to the attention of
          anyone who is suffering from the loss of a loved one."<br />—Margaret
          Lane, Midwest Book Review<br /><br />"Love Never Dies is an
          astonishing and refreshing story of survival of consciousness. She
          clearly shows the many ways spirit can communicate through us and with
          animals and even objects. I could hardly put the book down, and I have
          read many of these types of books. This is a great read for those who
          have lost a loved one and are looking for answers to the ways spirit
          makes contact with us, and also how we can contact spirit to make
          peace. I highly recommend this book."<br />—Dave Campbell, Certified
          Windbridge Research Medium (WCRM) <br /><br />"Love Never Dies is
          guaranteed to give immense hope to those grieving the perceived loss
          of a loved one. Dr. Jamie Turndorf, together with her husband, Jean,
          now in spirit, provide stunning evidence of the continuity of love and
          life, along with the tools to help anyone connect with those in the
          unseen world."<br />—Suzanne Giesemann, Author of Messages of Hope<br /><br />"When
          I held this 248-page spiritual giant in my hands, even before I
          started turning the pages I knew I had found a special guide that
          would help me through one of the hardest journeys I have taken. To
          love so deeply and completely and then to have the person removed from
          my physical life is hard enough, but then to find a way to stay
          connected with them is even more frustrating.<br />"So it was totally
          heaven-sent when I was asked to review this gentle messenger that
          helped me to stay connected, to recognize the connection, and to even
          validate the connection.&nbsp;I also loved the way the author shared
          on such a deep and personal level it helped me to not feel alone and
          gave me courage to bypass my mind.&nbsp;I would recommend this sweet
          giant to anyone who feels the loss of a loved one. Thanks so much
          Jamie for the awesome blueprint."<br />—Riki Frahmann, Chief Reviewer
          for the ezine Mystic Living Today<br /><br />"In her book Love Never
          Dies: How to Reconnect and Make Peace with the Deceased, Turndorf
          teaches a method for dialoguing with the departed which holds
          tremendous healing potential for everyone who has lost a loved one.
          Turndorf is passionate in her certainty that we can actually
          communicate with those we’ve lost.&nbsp;Since reading&nbsp;Love Never
          Dies&nbsp;(which describes the dialogue process in great detail) I’ve
          used Turndorf’s technique and it has opened life-changing doors for
          me. It’s a powerful process, and I encourage everyone who feels ready
          to try it."<br />—Ken Page LCSW, from "A Life-Changing Exercise for
          Anyone Who Has Lost a Loved One" published in Psychology Today<br /><br />"I
          just finished reading Dr. Turndorf’s most recent book, Love Never
          Dies, and I highly recommend it for everyone who wants to connect with
          a loved one who has passed on to the Spirit Realm. This book tells the
          heartfelt story of the author’s tragic loss of her husband and his
          subsequent messages to her from beyond the veil, and it outlines the
          steps we should take to communicate with the spirits of the people we
          loved on Earth."<br />—Garnet Schulhauser, Author of Dancing on a
          Stampand Dancing Forever with Spirit<br /><br />"As a colleague of
          both Jamie and Jean, I have been blessed with firsthand witness to
          their devotion and mutual love, in life and now through death. In her
          eloquently written new book, Dr. Turndorf has made their everlasting
          love accessible to all. Just as the uniqueness of their emotional
          connection radiated to me, it will radiate to you, the reader, in this
          groundbreaking work that will guide you to reestablish your
          relationships with loved ones in spirit... and even make peace, if
          needed."<br />—Dr. Robert S. Pepper, Author of Emotional Incest in
          Group Psychotherapy
