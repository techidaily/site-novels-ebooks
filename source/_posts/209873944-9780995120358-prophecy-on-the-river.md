            Lights with no apparent source, heating her back while she walks
            along a riverbank, initiate American anthropologist Judith Hoch into
            a decades-long process of spiritual renewal. In this vividly written
            memoir, Judith describes what happens when she and her husband
            struggle to restore newly-purchased New Zealand land to native
            forest. It quickly becomes a spiritual as well as ecological
            task-and proves far more difficult than she ever anticipated.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In a rare meeting of the Afro-Cuban Lucumi and Aotearoa M훮ori
            cultures, Judith uses skills learned as a student of Orisha
            divination and mediumship to delve into the tragic events that
            historically impacted the land as she seeks a way to heal it. Guided
            by her Miami-based padrino, Ernesto Picardo, and working with her
            Waitaha M훮ori friend, Aroha Ropata, Judith connects with the land's
            ancestors and the spiritual forces required for her ecological
            efforts to succeed.

          "In&nbsp;Prophecy on the River, artist, anthropologist and
          environmentalist Judith Hoch describes her magical experiences with
          the people, land and history of New Zealand. Written in graceful,
          eloquent prose, this memoir tells how Hoch came to recognise in a very
          heartfelt and visceral way that her own spiritual rejuvenation, along
          with that of both indigenous M훮ori people and descendants of the
          colonial settlers, depends upon acquiring deep respect for rivers and
          forests, and appreciating the innate power of the natural world and
          its need for revitalization. Hoch writes of her efforts, with those of
          her husband John, to repopulate a forest preserve adjacent to her home
          on the South Island; her encounters with ancient, majestic trees and
          with spirits that inhabit waterways; and her struggle with neighbours
          who despoil the land. Her story is compelling, the narrative flows
          easily, and the overall experience is both moving and
          motivating."&nbsp;- Richard Schwartz, Emeritus Professor, Florida
          International University
        </p>
        <p>
          "Judith Hoch has written an anthropological book with a very
          &nbsp;personal difference. Much of Prophecy on the River is set around
          Wainui Bay on the eastern side of Golden Bay, where the author and her
          husband John McKie have come and gone for 40 years. Their 16 hectare
          (40 acre) forest block running up the hillside from the Wainui River
          has become their life's work; making tracks, planting trees, caring
          for them, and setting trap lines for predators. Real struggles have
          come from the environment, like the massive 2012 flood which isolated
          them for weeks.Throughout the book there are also tales of strange
          appearances of lights, divination and mediumship for the Wainui River
          and its woes, and appropriate solutions for the increasing toxicity
          which saddens everyone. At the book launch, I had to ask: How could a
          rationally trained anthropologist write such a mystical book? Her
          answer: "I'm 73, it's time for me to write how I feel, and bring
          together all I've learned over the years. In addition, in anthropology
          we have a tradition of researchers learning a new world view from the
          people they work with who hold quite different perspectives on the
          world of spirit." Quoting a well-known Maori whakatauki [proverb] that
          is central to Prophecy on the River, Judith says: "Look after the
          birds and the forest flourishes. If the forest flourishes, the birds
          flourish." - Gerard Hindmarsh, Nelson Mail

          description of the rape of the land and the disenfranchisement of the
