          • Examines the intricate carvings, chambers, and structures, revealing
          the site’s acoustical properties, shamanic symbolism, and astronomical
          alignments<br /><br />• Reveals how Karahan Tepe was used by shamans
          to connect with the Milky Way’s Galactic bulge in its role as the head
          of the cosmic serpent<br /><br />• Explains how the site’s builders,
          who created the world’s first post ice age civilization, are
          remembered in myth and legend as the Watchers and Nephilim of Jewish
          religious tradition and as the Anunnaki gods of Sumerian mythology<br /><br />Considered
          the most important archaeological discovery of the 21st century,
          Karahan Tepe is an enormous complex of stone structures in
          southeastern Turkey covering an estimated ten acres. Built more than
          11,000 years ago, Karahan Tepe contains some of the oldest monumental
          architecture anywhere on Earth, including human and animal statues,
          ubiquitous snake carvings, T-shaped pillars, and interconnecting
          underground enclosures with stone columns carved directly from the
          bedrock.<br /><br />Chronicling his explorations of Karahan Tepe,
          Andrew Collins presents the first in-depth investigation of the
          discoveries at the site: who built it, its astronomical alignments,
          and its cosmological connections. He examines the intricate carvings
          and architectural features, including a newly discovered statue of a
          giant human figure. Explaining how the site functioned as a shamanic
          oracle center, Collins shows how its rock-cut structures were used to
          connect with the Milky Way’s Galactic Bulge and stars of Scorpius in
          their role as the head and active spirit of a perceived cosmic
          serpent. He traces this serpent motif throughout history, identifying
          it with the biblical serpent of Eden, the kundalini of Vedic
          tradition, and the black snake of the Yezidis. He demonstrates how the
          belief in the existence of the Milky Way serpent among the inhabitants
          of Karahan Tepe went on to influence the foundation of the Gnostic
          Ophite mysteries suppressed by the Christian Church. He also shows how
          the founders of Karahan Tepe were recalled in Hebrew myth and legend
          as the Watchers and Nephilim and in Sumerian and Babylonian mythology
          as the Anunnaki.<br /><br />Sharing a wealth of evidence, Collins
          confirms that Karahan Tepe and its sister site of Göbekli Tepe
          belonged to the world’s first post–Ice Age civilization, which today
          bears the enigmatic name of Taş Tepeler.
