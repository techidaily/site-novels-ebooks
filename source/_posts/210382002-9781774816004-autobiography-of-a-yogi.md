            The value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the
            fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men
            of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner,
            but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book about
            yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary
            lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance
            both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had
            the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader
            render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is
            certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind
            and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be
            published in the West.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life-
            history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the
            venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of
            my&nbsp;Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines.&nbsp;It was at Puri, in
            Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He
            was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and
            was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of
            youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the
            people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England,
            too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities,
            particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa
            Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as
            his emissary to the West.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence,
            and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously
            accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own
            community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall
            his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored
            garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the
            entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and
            somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm,
            but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen
            as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither
            multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of
            India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath,
            "Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his
            mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of
            being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried
            to a triumphant completion. I am glad, indeed, to be able to record
            this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar.
            Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself
            unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa
            Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages.&nbsp;
