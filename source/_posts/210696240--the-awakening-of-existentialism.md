          <p>
            &nbsp;Nowadays, you and I are in the midst of AI, big data,
            multimedia, gossip, rumors, materialistic desires, and the great
            trend of the times.In the midst of the confusion and material
            satisfaction caused by complicated and novel things, have you ever
            thought about examining life with a reflective attitude and taking a
            careful and quiet look at life, the apparent convenience and
            innovation of technological civilization, but deepening the hidden
            nature of life that is hard to erase and sad and miserable at the
            bottom of our habitual thinking?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;If human life is like a special, unusual, significant and
            far-reaching key, every morning when you wake up to take it, you
            have to fill out the application form carefully and seriously,
            without being meticulous.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Before going to sleep at night, thank God for today's gift and
            return the key to life with gratitude.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;If we have used the key of life thousands of times, over and
            over again, then why do we have to do as Sisyphus did, with great
            effort, to push a boulder up a mountain?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;After pushing a boulder up to the top of the mountain, we let
            it roll back down again, and so on, day after day, applying and
            repeating forever. ......
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Imagine when we return the key to life, do we take an
            introspective attitude and examine our life deeply: what have we
            achieved today? What have we failed?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;So one cannot help but ask: which direction should we choose
            for the existence of the universe and life itself, and what
            lifestyle should we adopt?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;What is the value of the existence of life itself, and what is
            the true meaning of the existence of life itself?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;What if the days of our existence in the universe, in life
            itself, always begin under such hard-won circumstances?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;If our cosmic life existence, our existence itself, has always
            started in such a hard way and ended in such a sad way, then we must
            have a deeper self-awareness and reflection on our cosmic life
            existence, our existence itself.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Therefore, the question of life and death will again become a
            sharp and sensitive issue.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;The Eastern and Western philosophies of life have, for ages,
            attempted to unravel the mystery of life and death in the existence
            of everything in the universe itself, in order to understand the
            true meaning of the existence of the world around us.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;They attribute life to the simple "existence" that
            distinguishes between animals and inanimate things, and to the
            "mind" that is uniquely human.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;It even goes on to use the phenomena that differentiate
            everything from one generation to another and the various theories
            that explain these phenomena, in order to decipher the existence of
            life in the universe.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;To decipher the knowledge and culture inherent in the
            existence of life in the universe. It serves the purpose of the
            existence and evolution of a certain kind of being itself.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;However, "mind" is a sum of the ability to realize the motive
            by the biological reaction of people through the precipitation and
            storage of known things.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;It is the sum of all the thinking abilities to feel, observe,
            understand, judge, choose, remember, imagine, hypothesize, and
            reason, and then to guide their behavior according to it.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Thus, 'mind' covers the 'philosophical' level: the
            accumulation and storage of the known (subconscious); combined with
            the 'biological' (consciousness) level of brain information
            processing, that is, 'physiological response'.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;The "mental" activity that engages in the conscious effort to
            achieve a certain ideal or purpose, thus consciously defining the
            purpose, is applied to the mental state.
