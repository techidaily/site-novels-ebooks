          Is it possible to fully accept, even love, the life you have? Is it
          possible to drop the struggle to make yourself and your life
          different? Acclaimed teacher and bestselling author Roger Housden says
          yes in this profound alternative to nonstop striving and
          self-criticism. Whether about our relationships, careers, or
          spirituality, many of us judge ourselves as not measuring up. But
          fulfillment comes when we stop struggling and learn to trust the
          wisdom of what life presents us with.Housden wrote
          <i>Dropping the Struggle</i> as someone who, up until a few years ago,
          spent much of his time in a covert struggle with life. Despite his
          success, he often felt that something was missing. He struggled for
          years with an ongoing spiritual longing, with questions of meaning and
          purpose, with the search for love, with all the usual difficulties of
          being human, until he finally realized — though not with his thinking
          mind — that the only thing life was asking of him was to rest in a
          deeper knowing that was always there, usually silently, behind the
          arguments and strategies that would so commonly occupy his conscious
          self.“Struggle will never get us the things we want most,” Housden
          writes, “love; meaning; presence; freedom from anxiety over the past
          and future; contentment with ourselves exactly as we are,
          imperfections and all; the acceptance of our mortality — because these
          things lie outside the ego’s domain. For these, we need another way.
          That way begins and ends in surrender, in letting go of our resistance
          to life as it presents itself.”
