            >A Zen study wrapped in a memoir of destruction and healing written
            by an elite ultrarunner as she struggles to make it to the other
            side of a life-shattering injury with her sanity, and her marriage,
            intact</b
          ><br /><br />After flipping her raft days away from help on a trip
          down the remote Salmon River, Katie Arnold’s shattered leg tests both
          her spirit and her marriage for years to come. It also reignites her
          meditation practice and motivates her to dive into Zen in search of
          healing. Before the accident, Katie was an elite ultrarunner with a
          simmering but adequate marriage who avoided being indoors whenever
          possible. But who is she afterwards?<br /><br />In the midst of
          hardship, Katie turns for support to the Zen practice she had long
          dabbled in. <i>Brief Flashings in the Phenomenal World</i> is a Zen
          study wrapped in a memoir that tells the story of a search for
          stillness by a woman born for wildness. Spanning roughly two years,
          from shortly before the accident through the long, uncertain healing
          of both leg and marriage, it is a personal narrative of that
          tumultuous time nested inside meditations on Zen.&nbsp;<br /><br />Having
          gone from a reluctant spiritualist to a Zen practitioner over the
          course of a decade, Katie Arnold offers unique company for those
          seeking nature’s exquisite highs as well as for creatives,
          spiritualists, and sensualists who want to slow down and examine the
          possibilities of a well-lived life. As the late Japanese master
          Shunryu Suzuki wrote, “Sometimes a flashing will come through the dark
          sky.” These brief flashings are enlightenment—moments when we suddenly
          feel as if we’re part of everything, and everything’s part of us. This
          book is about how to experience the flashings when they come, and
          about what they mean for how we live our lives.

        <p>
          <b><br />Praise for Katie Arnold's previous book, Running Home:</b
          ><br /><br /><br />“In her debut memoir,
          <i>Running Home</i>,&nbsp;Katie Arnold does an admirable job of
          trusting the everyday material of her life. . . . She writes a story
          exploring how her growing preoccupation with running has been
          intertwined with loving and losing her father. She takes the risk of
          being ordinary, and therefore human. . . . We want to know how other
          people live, and Arnold shows us.”<b
            >—<i>The New York Times Book Review </i></b
          ><br /><br />“Poignant and ultimately uplifting&nbsp;. .
          .&nbsp;will&nbsp;resonate with . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;just about
          everyone.”<b>—<i>The Washington Post</i></b
          ><br /><br />“This book is a gift.”<b
            >—Oliver Payne, Articles Editor, <i>National Geographic<br /></i></b
          ><br />“A contemplative, soul-searching account of the death of [Katie
          Arnold’s] beloved father and how she used long-distance running as a
          way to heal from the grief.”<b>—<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br /></b
          ><br />“Far more than a book about running, this touching memoir takes
          readers on a compelling and emotional journey as Arnold finds relief
          from her sorrow.”<b>—<i>Library Journal</i><br /></b><br />“Arnold
          masterfully captures the vulnerability of wading through grief with
          each step she takes towards self-discovery. This remarkable memoir
          will undoubtedly resonate with runners but equally so with children of
          divorce, new mothers, and those who have suffered the loss of a
          parent. An eloquent tribute to the complexity and vibrancy of a
          parent-child relationship.”<b>—<i>Booklist </i>(starred review)</b
          ><br /><br />“Katie Arnold is a gifted athlete and equally talented
          writer. In <i>Running Home</i> she speaks candidly about her
          relationship with her father and a family dynamic that verged on
          dysfunctional, yet was also empowering. Her story drew me in from the
          first line and I couldn’t stop turning the pages. A must-read for
          anyone looking for a deeper glimpse into the mindset of a fearless
          individual.”<b
            >—Dean Karnazes, ultramarathoner and author of
            <i>Ultramarathon Man</i></b
          ><br /><br />“[<i>Running Home</i>] invites comparisons with Cheryl
          Strayed’s&nbsp;Wild. . . . Gorgeous.”<b>—Anna Leahy, <i>LitHub</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Profound on every page . . . What Elizabeth Gilbert has
          done for travel, Katie Arnold has done here for running. I was
          breathless by the end, murmuring thanks. <i>Running Home </i>is an
          instant classic, one that will be read for years to come.”<b
            >—Michael Paterniti, author of
            <i>Love and Other Ways of Dying</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Running Home</i> is a lovely, big-hearted, and
          inspiring memoir that looks life’s challenges right in the eye. Katie
          Arnold writes about the curveballs and heartbreaks—as well as the
          joys—with a pure emotional courage that matches her physical feats on
          the ultramarathon trails. This is a book with soul.”<b
            >—Susan Casey, author of <i>Voices in the Ocean</i> and
            <i>The Wave</i></b
