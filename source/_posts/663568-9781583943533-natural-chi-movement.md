          The modern world is largely focused on the physical—on the appetites
          and senses, on doing and having—which can blind us to the spiritual
          realm. In <i>Natural Chi Movement</i>, Tienko Ting articulates a
          theory of life that unites the physical and spiritual worlds. He
          suggests there is nothing to learn or master; each of us—and every
          living thing—is a product of the merging of physical and spiritual
          energy, already endowed with the capacity to thrive and heal.
          Activation of our chi is the component to wellness that most of us
          have been missing. It is the essence of the practice of Natural Chi
          Movement.<br /><br /><i>Natural Chi Movement</i> guides modern seekers
          in embracing their spiritual nature and accessing the boundless
          potential of energy. Doing so, says Ting, can also help address global
          problems from health care to ecology. Featuring 23 illustrations, the
          book draws on Chinese history, philosophy, and medicine, as well as
          from the author’s own work with spiritual energy.
          <i>Natural Chi Movement</i> is an exploration into the nature of
          spiritual energy and how to access and use it for vibrant health and
          optimal well being. Written in a simple, lucid style,
          <i>Natural Chi Movement</i> sheds much-needed light on the nature of
          the energy that makes up all life, opening up a world of extraordinary
          healing for everyone.

          “Tienko is that rare breed of teacher who doesn’t tell you what to do
          or what to think,&nbsp;a healer who recognizes that all healing comes
          from within.… This book will not&nbsp;ask you to believe anything. The
          truth is always much simpler than that. N<i

          is as close to the source as you will ever experience, and what awaits
          you&nbsp;is nothing less than an opportunity of a lifetime.”<br />—From
          the foreword by William Spear, author of the best-selling book&nbsp;<i
            >Feng Shui Made Easy</i
          ><br /><br />
          “With <i>Natural Chi Movement,</i> Tienko Ting brings integrity and
          precision to this detailed look into the essence of Chinese medicine
          and the nature of chi. In clear and easy-to-understand language, he
          shows how chi and spiritual energy have a profound influence on the
          development of human life. <i>Natural Chi Movemen</i>t truly links the
          physical, emotional, and spiritual bodies that comprise a human being.
          As the director for twenty-five years of one of the world’s most
          renowned centers&nbsp;for holistic and Oriental philosophy and
          healing, I have rarely had the pleasure of&nbsp;coming across a
          presentation about the nature of chi that is as thorough,
          insightful,&nbsp;and interesting as that in this book by Dr. Tienko
          Ting.”<br />—Mario Binetti, former director, Kientalerhof Center for
          Holistic Healing,&nbsp;Kiental, Switzerland<br /><br /><i

          >
          deserves the attention of every health care scientist. A lifetime of
          investing in the waves of new drugs and devices that dominate medical
          treatments today has highlighted for me how little we really know
          about the magic of life. While the world is looking for answers in the
          double helix or a new molecular structure, Tienko has shown us another
          path that deserves equal scrutiny. In this book, Tienko walks us
          through ancient insights from Taoism and Buddhism to present a theory
          for using energy to transform our physical and spiritual health—a
          theory that could be the killer app for many challenges facing the
          health care industry today.”<br />—Steve Wiggins, founder and former
          CEO and chairman of Oxford Health Plan<br /><br />“I’m not the most
          spiritual person, so I approached <i>Natural Chi Movement</i> with
          somewhat of a raised eyebrow. But I was attracted immediately to the
          great clarity and strength with which Tienko Ting expressed his ideas.
          When I started practicing, I found that Natural Chi Movement is indeed
          simply natural. It’s literally whatever moves you. There are no rules,
          no instructions. Very quickly I realized that I barely needed any
          belief in the spiritual world to allow Natural Chi Movement to do the
          wonders it does, as I learned that what is truly spiritual is truly
          natural. No thought involved, no doctrine to hold. Understand this and
          the healing begins.”<br />—Ken Weinstein, president of Big Hassle
          Media<br /><br />“As a life-long student of Chinese philosophy and a
          practitioner of Chinese medicine and healing arts, I have read
          hundreds of books and textbooks on these subjects.
          <i>Natural Chi Movement</i> is by far the best treatise I have read,
          both for its clarity of thought and presentation, and for the simple
          yet profound truths that Tienko espouses. I have a far greater
          understanding now of chi, yin and yang, and how to achieve balance in
          life. Tienko’s book bridges the gap between living in the dark and
          living life fully realized and awake. With simple and elegant
          descriptions and examples, he clearly illuminates how we can gain
          access to our natural birthright of optimal health and well-being. We
          are at a critical juncture in human evolution. Tienko’s book provides
          guidance and the hope that we can choose a more enlightened path. It
          is imperative that we wake up to our true nature before we no longer
          have that choice.”<br />—David Mortell, acupuncturist and Chinese
          herbalist<br /><br />“<i>Natural Chi Movement</i> provides a powerful
          assessment of how to access and harness the powers of spiritual
          energy. … a real winner!”<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          Tienko Ting is the originator of Natural Chi Movement, the simple
          practice of allowing the body to respond naturally and spontaneously
          to the flow of energy. Born in Taiwan, Ting studied chi-enhancing
          techniques before discovering the ancient form of chi activation he
          currently practices. This form extends back to Bodhidharma, the
          renowned thirteenth-century Zen master. Since 1990, Ting has led
          Natural Chi Movement workshops throughout the US, Europe, and Asia.
