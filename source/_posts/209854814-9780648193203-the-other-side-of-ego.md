            I used to believe I was a pretty big deal. I had achieved fame and a
            level of power that allowed me access to people I considered
            important. As&nbsp;a broadcast journalist, I was recognized and
            admired. It was seducing, and I became swept up in all things that
            were me and no-one else.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then suddenly it all ended when I was diagnosed with a deadly
            disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            My awakening happened the night my doctor told me I had throat
            cancer, my daughter told me she didn’t care if I lived or died, and
            I didn’t blame her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly isolated in a world that only contained my imminent death I
            realized the kind of man I had become was exactly the kind of man I
            would not want to be near.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surgeries, Chemotherapy, and radiation were painful but paled in
            comparison to the internal savagery of my own mind, as I started on
            the journey to heal myself and salvage my soul. To do that, I had to
            change just about everything I believed in. I traveled around the
            world looking for answers and trying to find out who I was. But the
            global exploration wasn’t as intense as the internal journey that
            led me back through the darkness and then eventually into a place of
            reconciliation.

          Firstly, I just have to say that I was initially deeply honored when
          you asked me to review your book.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, my ego kicked in pretty quickly when I told myself it was
          likely to take several hours out of ‘my busy life’.&nbsp; I justified
          this excuse by supporting it with the knowledge that my daughter’s
          wedding was coming up, that I had a business that I was growing and
          that I had so many important meetings I needed to hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even this morning, when you sent me a&nbsp;message asking if I had
          made any progress, I was telling myself that I hadn’t really got the
          time and I felt inconvenienced. Such is the ego. Always thinking from
          a singular standpoint and with limited perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, thankfully my inner voice also stepped and said, ‘I owe
          Jonathan this much at least. Perhaps I can read a couple of chapters
          and give him some feedback at least.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Here I am some 6 hours later, having sat in my office, transfixed by
          this masterpiece. Your book, your story has such a raw beauty to it
          that I simply could not put it down! The emotions, the internal
          conflict, and the growth through the realization of the simple truth
          took me along on the journey with you. It had me reflecting on my own
          life and my constant search for the truth. My own battles with my
          well-disguised arrogance and selfishness.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reflected upon so many occasions where I too have looked outwardly
          for the answers by immersing myself in the teachings of others, such
          as Tony Robbins, and become disaffected or angered when I don’t find
          the ultimate ‘solution’. I now realize that all of these are just
          small parts of the whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book will transform lives more than you even realize. It has
          certainly provoked thoughts and feelings in me today that I did not
          expect. I have chuckled, I have smiled and I have shed a tear or two
          whilst reading this masterpiece.

          "The Other Side of Ego explores a mans attempt to confront not only
          his mortality but also the kind of lies we tell ourselves about what
          is really precious in life. This television journalist seemed to have
          everything, until that everything included cancer. Jonathan writes
          about his intimate journey with a deadly disease. But he also tells a
          bigger story about how the disease launched him on a pilgrimage to
          become a better man. He uses his remarkable gifts, as a raconteur to
          show how some of the answers about how to survive his cancer were
          revealed in his quest for redemption."
