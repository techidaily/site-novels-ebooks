          Reveals the origins and history of the New England witch hysteria, its
          continuing repercussions, and the multilayered practices of today’s
          modern witches <br /><br />• Shares the stories of 13 accused witches
          from the New England colonies through interviews with their living
          descendants <br /><br />• Explores the positive role witches played in
          rural communities until the dawn of the industrial age, despite
          ongoing persecution <br /><br />• Includes in-depth interviews with 25
          modern witchcraft practitioners, interwoven with practical information
          on the sacred calendar, herb lore, spells, and magical practices
          <br /><br />New England has long been associated with witches. And
          while the Salem witch trials happened long ago, the prejudices and
          fears engendered by the witchcraft hysteria still live on in our
          culture. What forces were at work that brought the witch hysteria
          quickly from Europe to the new American colony, a place of religious
          freedom--and what caused these prejudices to linger centuries after
          the fact? <br /><br />Weaving together history, sacred lore, modern
          practice, and the voices of today’s witches, Ellen Evert Hopman offers
          a new, deeper perspective on American witchcraft and its ancient pagan
          origins. Beginning with the “witch hysteria” that started in Europe
          and spread to the New World, Hopman explores the witch hunts,
          persecutions, mass hysteria, and killings, concluding that between
          forty and sixty thousand women and men were executed as witches.
          Combining records of known events with moving interviews with their
          descendants, she shares the stories of 13 New England witches
          persecuted during the witch trials, including Tituba and Mary Bliss
          Parsons, the Witch of Northhampton. Despite the number of false
          accusations during the witch hysteria in the New England colonies,
          Hopman reveals how there were practicing witches during that time and
          describes the positive role witches played in rural communities until
          the dawn of the industrial age. <br /><br />Exploring how the
          perception and practices of witches has evolved and expanded over the
          centuries, Hopman also includes in-depth interviews with 25 modern-day
          practitioners from a variety of pagan faiths, including druids,
          wiccans, Celtic reconstructionists, and practitioners of the fairy
          faith. Emerging from their insights is a treasure trove of practical
          information on the sacred calendar, herb lore, spells, and magical
          practices. Bringing together past and present, Hopman reveals what it
          really means to be a “witch,” redefining the label with dignity and
          spiritual strength.

          “<i>The Real Witches of New England</i> was fascinating and
          elucidating. I was especially intrigued by what contemporary witches
          believe and do. They are very much Earth oriented, listening to the
          spirits of the ancestors and the Earth, so in they are Pagan, though
          some venerate other deities, often Celtic or Egyptian. I closely
          resonate with these beliefs in my practice and teaching of ecstatic
          trance.”
