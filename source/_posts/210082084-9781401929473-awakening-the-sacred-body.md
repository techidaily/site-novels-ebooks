            >The power of the breath has been recognized for millennia as an
            integral part of health and well-being.&nbsp;In
            <i>Awakening the Sacred Body</i>, teacher Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche
            makes accessible the ancient art of Tibetan breath and movement
            practices. <br /></b
          ><br />In clear, easy-to-understand language, he outlines the theory
          and processes of two powerful meditations—the Nine Breathings of
          Purification and the Tsa Lung movements—that can help you change your
          relationship to yourself, to others, and to the world.<br /><br />The
          simple methods presented in Awakening the Sacred Body and in the
          accompanying online video focus on clearing and opening your energetic
          centers to allow the natural human qualities of love, compassion, joy,
          and equanimity to arise. When sadness releases, joy is able to arise.
          When anger releases, love becomes available. <br /><br />When
          prejudice releases, equanimity prevails. And when lack of kindness
          ceases, compassion is present.These practices, which focus the mind
          and breath together while performing specific body movements, will
          help you discover your inner wisdom and express your greatest
          potential.

          “Tenzin Rinpoche has written an eminently practical, lucid, and
          inspiring guide to traditional Tibetan body-based meditation
          practices. These practices are designed to help us let go of the
          habits of mind that obscure our experience of the spacious awareness
          and wisdom that is our true nature.
          <i>Awakening the Sacred Body</i> is an excellent resource for new and
          experienced practitioners alike.”<br />— <b>Sharon Salzberg</b>,
          author of <i>Lovingkindness </i>and <i>Faith<br /><br /></i>“I feel as
          if Tenzin Wangyal read my mind and body and then, in his kindness and
          wisdom, gave me clear, inspiring, accessible methods for integrating
          them. The insights, inspiration, and practices from this book offer so
          much support. This should be required reading for all those with an
          interest in yoga and meditation.”<br />— <b>Cyndi Lee</b>, founder of
          Om Yoga and author of <i>Yoga Body, Buddha Mind<br /><br /></i>“The
          wisdom tradition of Bön is yet another jewel from the spiritual
          treasury of Tibet. The Venerable Tenzin Wangyal polishes and presents
          it like a master jeweler, making it sparkle, delight, and give
          benefit. Read this book, work with it in a relaxed way, baby step by
          baby step, live with it, and your heart will open and your life will
          be way more fulfilling.”<br />— <b>Tenzin Robert Thurman</b>, Jey
          Tsong Khapa professor of Buddhist studies, Columbia University;
          president, Tibet House U.S.; and author of
          <i>Why the Dalai Lama Matters<br /><br /></i>“Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche
          delivers the good news that there isn’t any life situation that
          doesn’t offer us rich material to work with. He generously offers us
          ancient methods for synchronizing body, breath, and mind, teachings
          which are readily applicable to our modern lives. I highly recommend
          them.”<br />— <b>Michael Bernard Beckwith</b>, author of
          <i>Spiritual Liberation<br /><br /></i>“The existence and role of
          subtle, vital energies in the body known in Tibetan as ‘lung’ remain
          unknown by modern science, for they are most directly revealed through
          first-person experience. In his new book,
          <i>Awakening the Sacred Body</i>, Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche clearly
          explains various methods for refining and utilizing these energies, or
          ‘winds,’ to enhance one’s spiritual practice and awaken the body and
          mind. This is a valuable contribution to bringing the contemplative
          sciences of Tibet to the modern world.”<br />— <b>B. Alan Wallace</b>,
          author of <i>Mind in the Balance</i>
