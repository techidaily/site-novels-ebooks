          A comprehensive look at the history and practices of rural English
          witchcraft <br /><br />• Explores witch’s familiars and fetches,
          animal magic, and the forms of witchcraft practiced by rural
          tradespeople, such as blacksmiths, herbalists, and artisans
          <br /><br />• Offers practical insight into spells, charms, folk
          incantations, herbal medicine practices, amulets, sigils, and tools of
          the craft <br /><br />• Details the evolution of public perception of
          witchcraft throughout England’s history, including the laws against
          witchcraft in place until the 1950s and witchcraft’s contentious
          relationship with the Christian church <br /><br />In this practical
          guide, Nigel Pennick takes the reader on a journey through the
          practice of operative witchcraft in the British Isles from the Middle
          Ages and the Elizabethan era to the decriminalization of witchcraft in
          the 1950s and its practice today. <br /><br />Highlighting uniquely
          English traditions, Pennick explores fetches and witch’s familiars,
          animal magic, and the forms of witchcraft practiced by rural
          tradespeople, such as blacksmiths, herbalists, and artisans, to
          enhance their professional work and compel others to do their bidding,
          both man and beast. He provides actual spells, charms, and folk
          incantations, along with details about the magical use of a variety of
          herbs, including nightshades, the creation of amulets and sigils,
          protection against the Evil Eye, and the use of aromatic oils. Pennick
          explains the best times of day for different types of magic, how to
          identify places of power, and the use of the paraphernalia of
          operative witchcraft, such as the broom, the witches’ dial, and pins,
          nails and thorns. He explores the belief in three different types of
          witches: white witches, who offer help and healing for a fee; black
          witches, who harm others; and gray witches, who practice both white
          and black magic. Examining witchcraft’s contentious relationship with
          the Christian church, he investigates the persecution of witches
          throughout the UK and the British West Indies up until the mid-20th
          century. He offers a look into the changing public perceptions of
          witchcraft and the treatment of its followers as well as revealing how
          English churchmen would offer magical solutions to the perceived
          threat of black witchcraft. <br /><br />Painting an in-depth picture
          of English witchcraft, including how it relates to and differs from
          modern Wicca, Pennick reveals the foundation from which modern
          witchcraft arose. He shows how this context is necessary to
          effectively use these ancient skills and techniques and how the
          evolution of witchcraft will continue harmonizing the old ways with
          the new.
