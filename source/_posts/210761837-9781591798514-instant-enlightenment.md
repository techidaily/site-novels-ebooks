            <b>Explore the Other Side of Enlightenment</b><br />Does
            enlightenment have a dark side? It does, explains David Deida, but
            instead of closing to what seems unloving, we can learn to open as
            what we would rather avoid.<br />In Instant Enlightenment, this
            maverick author and teacher offers a "rude awakening" through a
            collection of daring exercises and practices intended to provoke,
            challenge, and immediately reveal the ever-present "love that lives
            all things." Each pithy chapter encourages readers to blast the
            light of consciousness on the taboos we hide in shadow, from our
            ideas about sex and money to emotions and spirituality.<br />Instant
            Enlightenment will surprise and possibly offend you—but it will lead
            you "fast and suddenly" to the realization of the sacred entirety of
            your experience.<br />"Dive straight into this book. Open to any
            page and read for two minutes, and you'll see that you are instant
            enlightenment."—Ken Wilber, author of A Brief History of Everything

        </h4>

        <p>
          <b>David Deida</b><br />Acknowledged as one of the most insightful and
          provocative spiritual teachers of our time, best-selling author
          <b>David Deida</b> continues to revolutionize the way that men and
          women grow spiritually and sexually. His teachings and writings on a
          radically practical spirituality for our time have been hailed as
          among the most original and authentic contributions to personal and
          spiritual growth currently available.<br />&nbsp;<br />Known
          internationally for his unique workshops on spiritual growth and
          sacred intimacy, Deida has designed and developed a remarkably
          effective program of transformative practices that addresses spiritual
          awakening in mind, body, and heart. He is a founding associate of
          Integral Institute and has taught and conducted research at the
          University of California Medical School in San Diego; University of
          California, Santa Cruz; San Jose State University; Lexington
          Institute, Boston; and Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, France.<br />&nbsp;<br />Deida
          is known worldwide as the author of hundreds of essays, audio and
          video programs, articles, and books that bring to light an integral
          approach to spirituality. His works include
          <i>The Way of the Superior Man</i> and <i>Instant Enlightenment</i>;
          practical books on authentic sexual spirituality including
          <i>Finding God Through Sex</i>, <i>The Enlightened Sex Manual</i>, and
          <i>Blue Truth</i>; and the autobiographical novel about highly
          unconventional spiritual training,
          <i>Wild Nights</i>.<br />&nbsp;<br />David Deida's books are published
          in more than twenty-five languages worldwide and are required reading
          in university, church, and spiritual center courses, source texts used
          in men’s and women’s groups around the world, and are considered
          important resources for spiritual transformation and sacred sexuality
          by everyone from achievement coach Tony Robbins to philosopher Ken
          Wilber to minister and spiritual spokeswoman Marianne Williamson.<br />&nbsp;<br />The
          <i>Watkins Review</i> has included Deida in its annual Spiritual 100
          List every year since 2011 to the present, designating the most
          spiritually influential living people worldwide. Learn more at
