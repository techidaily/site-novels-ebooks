          In this compelling memoir, Hannah Robinson relates how she was injured
          in an accident while on holiday in Tenerife, sustaining
          life-threatening multiple injuries. While still "unconscious" she
          entered a "near-death experience", where she experienced true peace
          and love. She also received the information she needed to come to
          terms with the biggest, negative issue she would continue to face; the
          life-long rejection and enforced secrecy of her father, a Catholic
          priest. While healing in hospital and at home, Hannah started to
          understand how her father's actions and her near-death experience were
          inextricably linked; that they'd both occurred at all was more than
          just coincidence. Within these pages, Hannah shares many of the stages
          of her life-transforming journey, both wonderful and excruciating,
          that have brought her to a deeper understanding of how and why this
          all happened. Increasingly struck by the contrast between her own
          spiritual experience and her treatment by the Catholic Church, Hannah
          examines the relationship between organised religion and near-death
          experiences and makes a good argument for love being the most
          emotionally, spiritually and psychologically healing power there is;
          one that transcends human belief systems and ultimately unites us all
          as one.
