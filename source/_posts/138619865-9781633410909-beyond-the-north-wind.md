            "The North" is simultaneously a location, a direction, and a
            mystical concept. Although this concept has ancient roots in
            mythology, folklore, and fairy tales, it continues to resonate today
            within modern culture. McIntosh leads readers, chapter by chapter,
            through the magical and spiritual history of the North, as well as
            its modern manifestations, as documented through physical records,
            such as runestones and megaliths, but also through mythology and
            lore.
          </p>
          <p>
            This mythic conception of a unique, powerful, and mysterious
            Northern civilization was known to the Greeks as "Hyberborea"--the
            "Land Beyond the North Wind"--which they considered to be the true
            origin place of their god, Apollo, bringer of civilization. Through
            the Greeks, this concept of the mythic North would spread throughout
            Western civilization.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, McIntosh discusses Russian Hyperboreanism, which he
            describes as among "the most influential of the new religions and
            quasi-religious movements that have sprung up in Russia since the
            fall of Communism" and which is currently almost unknown in the
            West.
