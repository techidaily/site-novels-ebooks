          The weight-loss book for women that will change the way you look and
          feel about yourself. Lose belly fat, stop yo-yo dieting and overcome
          emotional eating! Are you a woman who has had a lifelong struggle with
          your weight and tried many different diets unsuccessfully? Do you
          struggle with yo-yo dieting and emotional eating and do not want a
          programme that is too restrictive or hard to follow? Do you suffer
          from type 2 diabetes or are you insulin resistant? If you answered yes
          to any of these questions, then Your 12-Week Body and Mind
          Transformation is for you! This is not a diet book. Instead, this
          hands-on, practical guide offers a permanent lifestyle change that
          will help you correct your eating habits by changing your mindset to
          achieve the results you want. Spread over 12 weeks, the easy-to-follow
          programme will teach you how to embark on a life-changing journey one
          step, and one day, at a time. Each week features a healthy, nourishing
          and delicious meal plan that is low in sugar, quick and easy to
          prepare, and suitable for the whole family to enjoy. The book is also
          full of practical tips, advice and weekly homework tasks to help you
          identify what is holding you back mentally and emotionally. Shopping
          and swap-out lists are included too, as are weekly exercises that are
          easy to do at home, with links to online video demonstrations. With
          its focus on a low sugar intake and intermittent fasting, which has
          proven to be the best and most effective method to boost weight loss,
          improve the immune system and rebalance hormones, Your 12-Week Body
          and Mind Transformation will help you overcome emotional eating and
          forever put a stop to yo-yo dieting.
