          The author’s journey to becoming a Bushman shaman and healer and how
          this tradition relates to shamanic practices around the world<br /><br />•
          Explores the Bushmen’s ecstatic shaking and dancing practices<br /><br />•
          Written by the first non-Bushman to become fully initiated into their
          healing and spiritual ways<br /><br />In
          <i>Bushman Shaman,</i> Bradford Keeney details his initiation into the
          shamanic tradition of the Kalahari Bushmen, regarded by some scholars
          as the oldest living culture on earth. Keeney sought out the Bushmen
          while in South Africa as a visiting professor of psychotherapy. He had
          known of the Kalahari “trance dance,” wherein the dancers’ bodies
          shake uncontrollably as part of the healing ceremony. Keeney was drawn
          to this tradition in the hope that it might explain and provide a
          forum for his own ecstatic “shaking,” which he had first experienced
          at the age of 19 and had tried to suppress and hide throughout his
          adult life.<br /><br />For more than a dozen years Keeney danced with
          Bushmen shamans in communities throughout Botswana and Namibia, until
          finally becoming fully initiated into their doctoring and spiritual
          ways. Through his rediscovery of the “rope to God” in a Bushman shaman
          dream, he offers readers accounts of his shamanic world travels and
          the secrets of the soul he learned along the way. In
          <i>Bushman Shaman</i> Keeney also reveals his work with shamans from
          Japan, Tibet, Bali, Thailand, Australia, and North and South America,
          providing new understandings of other forms of shamanic spiritual
          expression and integrating the practices of all these traditions into
          a sacred circle of one truth.

          “Brad Keeney may be the closest we have to a genuine American shaman.
          In <i>Bushman Shaman</i>, he shares his remarkable adventures into the
          psyche and his equally remarkable sensibility as an explorer of the
          human spirit. Fascinating.”
