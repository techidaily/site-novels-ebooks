          Have you ever asked yourself why you are on planet Earth? And what the
          ultimate purpose for your life might be? Well, Jack Canfield asked
          himself this very question and came up with a surprising answer —part
          of which included a vision revealing that he is part of a "Golden
          Motorcycle Gang" —a gang whose intent is to have fun, but also to make
          significant contributions to the well-being of humanity.<br /><br />
          During a joyful dinner many years ago in Santa Barbara, California,
          Jack told his friend William Gladstone about the Gang. Upon hearing
          this account, William had an epiphany that Jack's story held a
          powerful underlying truth not only explaining Jack's true purpose, but
          William's as well. For more than ten years, William encouraged Jack to
          write a book based on the story of the Gang, so they have now
          collaborated on this work to show you its relevance to this critical
          moment in the history of human civilization . . . and also to you,
          personally. <br /><br />As you read, you will be introduced to some of
          the extraordinary members of the Golden Motorcycle Gang, including
          visionary thinkers such as Barbara Marx Hubbard, the originator of the
          concept of Conscious Evolution. The mystery and adventure inherent in
          this book reveals that there is now the opportunity for all of us on
          planet Earth to make a quantum leap in real time toward choosing the
          actual course of our evolution. Along the way, we are meant to
          experience the joy that comes from recognizing who we really are.
          Perhaps, as you embark on Jack's journey along with him . . . you will
          find that you are also a member of the Golden Motorcycle Gang! So get
          ready for the adventure of your life!

          “Take the trip of your life about the ‘trip of your life’ in this
          wonderfully entertaining, emotionally uplifting, and spiritually
          enlightening journey of the soul from the pens of Jack Canfield and
          Bill Gladstone. What a gift!” <br /><b>— Neale Donald Walsch</b

            >The Golden Motorcycle Gang</i
          >
          is a wonderful book that shares my vision of a new humanity and world
          based in love, awareness, and truth.” <br /><b>— don Miguel Ruiz</b
          >,&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling author of
          <i>The Four Agreements</i><br /><br />“This delightful book is an
          invitation to remember who you really are and why you are here. It’s a
          reminder to step out, step up, and stop playing small. And, most
          important, it’s a cosmic kick in the pants to claim, and share with
          the world, your brilliance, your power, and your mission.”<br /><b
            >— Arielle Ford</b
          >, author of<i> The Soulmate Secret</i><br /><br />“In an era of
          increasing confusion, <i>The Golden Motorcycle Gang</i> gives precise
          examples of how to orient ourselves toward a new, workable
          consciousness—one that provides the larger viewpoint of human
          evolution as our guiding orientation. This means we have to affect the
          world by living the evolution we want to see happen, getting our
          integrity together, and beyond everything else, allowing our actions
          and goals to flow from a spiritual intelligence beyond the ego. In
          other words, we have to allow ourselves to be guided toward conscious
          evolution. This is a book that gives more evidence of a 12th Insight
          awakening, just in time for 2012.”<br /><b>— James Redfield</b>,
