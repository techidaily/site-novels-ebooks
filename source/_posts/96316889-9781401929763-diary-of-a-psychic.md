            >A fascinating and revealing look at the everyday life of a
            psychic<br /></b
          ><br />Sonia Choquette discovered her psychic abilities as a young
          child. Gifted from birth, she was able to see beyond the veil of the
          inner workings of her family members’, friends’, and neighbors’ lives.
          While still a teenager, she began to give readings, amazing her
          clients with her psychic insights. Seeking to deepen her skills, she
          studied with two master psychic/spiritual teachers and began to see
          beyond predictions of the future . . . into the causes of the future.
          <br /><br />With the help of a group of spiritual guides who have been
          working with her since childhood, and combining this support with
          metaphysical law, Sonia developed the ability to see the soul plan
          that each of us is born with. It became her mission to put her
          clients’ lives back on track, steering them through the tricky waters
          of romance, divorce, illness, high finance, sickness, and death. She
          became a soul guide for "happy endings." <br /><br />By pulling back
          the curtain and sharing her personal story, this revolutionary new
          teacher and world-renowned psychic shatters the myth that psychic
          implies psycho, and reveals the beauty and power the sixth sense holds
          for us all! <br /><br />A teacher, an author, and a storyteller, as
          well as a gifted psychic, Sonia Choquette is in international demand
          for her guidance, wisdom, and capacity to heal the soul. This is a
          story of the Evolution of the "6th Sense" fresh from a child's
          perspective. Also, this is "Just A Great Read!"

          “I love Sonia Choquette. She’s a beautiful, sweet soul with a Divine
          connection. Her book <i>Diary of a Psychic </i>shows how you, too, can
          connect with your own psychic abilities. In my world, Sonia is
          tops!”<br /><b>— Louise Hay</b>, best-selling author of
          <i>You Can Heal Your Life</i><br /><br />“Sonia Choquette is the most
          authentic person in psychic phenomena I have ever encountered. Her
          readings are incredibly accurate.”<br /><b>— Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</b>,
          best-selling author of <i>10 Secrets for Success</i> and

          the unfettered heart, a gifted seer who offers the spiritual truths
          like so many apples from the tree. She opened up doors for me that
          were nailed shut, and I encourage anyone who seeks to open their heart
          to her special brand of sunshine.” <br /><b>— Billy Corgan</b>,
          singer, songwriter, and founder of the Smashing Pumpkins and Zwan
          <br /><br />“Sonia Choquette deserves the old-fashioned term ‘oracle.’
          She is both a seer and a guide. She not only illuminates the path but
          the obstacles that may bar our progress. Her help is invaluable and
          deeply grounded.”<br /><b>— Julia Cameron</b>,&nbsp;best-selling
          author of <i>The Artist’s Way</i>
