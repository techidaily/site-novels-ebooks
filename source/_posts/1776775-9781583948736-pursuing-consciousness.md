          Building on his previous groundbreaking work, Peter Ralston once again
          proves to be a sure-footed guide for readers seeking to negotiate the
          challenging terrain of personal and spiritual growth. In accessible
          language, Ralston demonstrates how the lofty goals&nbsp;of
          self-transformation and enlightenment can be achieved with a
          no-nonsense approach available to anyone willing to reach&nbsp;beyond
          their current experience of self and reality.&nbsp;<i
            >Pursuing Consciousness</i
          >&nbsp;is a&nbsp;down-to-earth handbook for staying focused on the
          work at hand, even while tackling&nbsp;such unsettling tasks as
          investigating deeply ingrained psychological beliefs and identifying
          common&nbsp;areas of misunderstanding that hamper transformative
          growth.<br /><br />
          Ralston explains that deeper levels of consciousness aren't just for
          monks—anyone can have an enlightenment experience. He shows that
          enlightenment does&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;transform the self, and
          transforming the self does&nbsp;<i>not</i>&nbsp;produce enlightenment.
          Once we grasp that these two pursuits take place in entirely different
          domains of consciousness, we can use each to empower the other.
          Ralston provides specific tools for changing the very person that we
          experience being. His work has been acclaimed by people from a diverse
          range of disciplines—including spiritual teachers, psychiatrists,
          cognitive scientists, physicists, and artists. As with Ralston’s
          previous works, this book points the way to a direct&nbsp;encounter
          with&nbsp;the true nature of&nbsp;Being and the possibility of real
          personal change.

          “Ralston is unparalleled in his ability to clearly articulate both the
          key questions to contemplate, and the life-changing insights one can
          gain from doing so. I've learned more from him than any other author.”
