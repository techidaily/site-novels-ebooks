          The Six Initiations' by David Brown and Vanda Selby is a book that
          came about as an outgrowth of their psychospiritual-psychotherapy
          activities working with individual and groups in the south of England.
          David and Vanda wanted to be able to offer the work they do to a wider
          audience than they can cater for in their workshops, and they decided
          that with a workbook of instructions (an audio CD of visualizations is
          also available separately), it would be possible for people to
          experience workshops without a facilitator present. The starting point
          and key concept of the book is that the Divine' cannot be fully and
          permanently experienced unless other issues (or archetypes) are
          explored and engaged with. The Inner Child, for example, has needs for
          love and play that must be met. The flow of Abundance into one's life
          and out onto the world also needs to be accepted and enjoyed, not
          blocked or sabotaged. Loss and grief need to be acknowledged,
          experienced and dealt with, not denied and repressed. The Warrior
          within, able to act assertively rather than aggressively, is needed
          for us to live effectively, and to take responsibility for the tasks
          and challenges of life. Love and Compassion need to be accepted and
          expressed in our lives so that lives are lived from the heart as well
          as from the mind, and so that we can be of service and support to
          others and to ourselves. Finally, the Divine can be experienced and
          enjoyed, not as a result of austerities and following rules, but as
          the well of spirit that is within us all. The whole book has to do
          with claiming your birthright and in dealing with the demons that stop
          us from doing so. In putting this book together, David and Vanda have
          drawn from their our own training and experience in psychotherapy, NLP
          &amp; Life Coaching, and spirituality, pulling together techniques
          from a number of psychotherapeutic and spiritual approaches and
          traditions. These include Transactional Analysis, The Law of
          Attraction, Shamanism, Non Violent Communication, Life Coaching,
          Guided Visualization, NLP, Art Work, Ritual, and Jungian Archetypes.
          David Brown is a pysychothapist with degrees in Psychology and in
          Linguistics, and qualifications in counselling, psychospiritual
          psychotherapy, and Life Coaching. He is co-author of The Power of
          Metaphor (Crown House, 2,000). Vanda Selby has had training in
          shamanism, psychotherapy and NLP, and has had extensive therapeutic
          experience, especially with children in schools and with women.
