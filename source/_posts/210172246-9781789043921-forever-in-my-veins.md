          Emmy Award-winning producer and New York Times bestselling author
          Lionel Friedberg has spent 50 years making films as diverse as
          full-length theatrical features and television documentaries. After
          growing up in South Africa during the troubled era of apartheid he
          began his career during the dying days of colonialism in Central
          Africa. He eventually settled in Los Angeles where his work took him
          to the sound stages of Hollywood and to the most remote regions of the
          Earth. His career exposed him to the extraordinary wonders of our
          planet and brought him into close contact with many unforgettable
          personalities from maverick scientists to politicians, entertainers
          and people who survived near-death experiences. His observations have
          taught him that life is far more complex and infinitely stranger than
          we can imagine. When he was struck by an unexpected life-threatening
          illness his efforts to find a way to save his life took him back to
          Africa where he encountered the age-old rituals and powerful healing
          methods of African shamans. Their mysterious ways have much to teach
          us and are as relevant today as they were in ancient times.
