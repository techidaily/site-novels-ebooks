            Prayer, especially, mission praying has never been sustained through
            merely or- ganizing mission programmes. Some Christians out of
            emotion would shout and jump during such meetings but at the end,
            they never pray again for the un- reached until, may be, another
            year when they gather for another programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            We must trust God to catch the spirit of prayer. This however, is a
            personal thing. The reason is because a programme may kindle a
            prayerful spirit, but can- not sustain a prayerful spirit. Catching
            the spirit of prayer is what sustains a prayerful spirit. The will
            to spend time with God alone and to pray for the na- tions on a
            consistent basis often leads men to catch the spirit of prayer, and
            ulti- mately the spirit of missions. My prayer is that you catch
            this spirit as you read through this little book, and pray, pray and
            pray!

            The copies of the first edition, titled, "Prayer, A Christian
            Response to the Missions Challenge" had exhausted. A Christian
            brother who read the book vis- ited and told me how he took a copy
            of the book to his church and read some excerpts to the audience as
            he challenged the church on the matter of prayer. And he requested
            for more copies. I told him we did not have them again, except a
            few. He asked what it would cost to do a re-print.
          </p>
          <p>
            This revised edition with some excerpts from two previous editions
            of Occu- py, centering on the theme Prayer &amp; Missions has been
            reproduced, courtesy of the generosity of this brother.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is my prayer that through this book our eyes will be further
            opened to see the incredible power prayer has in throwing wide open,
            the gates of hell when His Church takes mission praying as business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Painfully today, prayer, a great weapon for revival, national
            rebirth and turn- ing nations to Christ is being misused and abused.
            When a church, which is sup- posed to be a house of prayer for all
            nations, is turned to a house of prayer for self and personal
            vendetta against perceived enemies, it jeopardizes the purpose for
            which God has established the Church.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prayer, the Christian's Airpower, is a call for Christians to go
            back to selfless intercessory prayer for church revival and the
            evangelization of the nations.&nbsp;
