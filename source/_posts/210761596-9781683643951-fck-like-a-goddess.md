              >“I felt as if I had had a cathartic emotional experience not by
              talking but by following Ms. Roxo’s coaching to tune into my
              energy and desire.” —<i>New York Times</i></b
            ><br /><br />What if your deepest fears and wounds were the KEY to
            living a turned on, passionate life, sharing your gifts with the
            world, and having mind-blowing orgasms along the way? And what if
            you could embrace all of you—all of your messy, wild, raw, sensual
            self—exactly as you are right now AND still feel good? This is what
            it means to f*ck like a goddess—literally and metaphorically. To let
            life make love to you and enjoy every bit, even the parts that hurt,
            and to find the magic in all of it. And this is your birthright.<br />&nbsp;<br />So
            why is it so damn hard for women to simply feel comfortable in their
            own skin, let alone feel strong and secure enough to freely share
            their gifts with the world? “Because each of us has been
            conditioned, programmed, and literally <i>brainwashed</i> into
            thinking we are not enough,” writes Alexandra Roxo,” and it is up to
            us to rewrite that story.”<br />&nbsp;<br />A prominent voice in
            transformational healing and the divine feminine, Roxo shares
            tried-and-true methods that have led to both her own healing and
            that of hundreds of her coaching clients over the years.<br />&nbsp;<br />“We
            are in need of an uprising of bold, wild women who have reclaimed
            their bodies and stand in their sacred sexuality&nbsp;<i>for them</i
            >,” she writes. “As women, we need to liberate our voices, step into
            total security within ourselves, and fully own our raw, sensual
            power, finally letting go of the shame, guilt, denial, and
            repression that’s been put upon us.”<br />&nbsp;<br />The methods in
            this book will inspire you, challenge you, bring up your resistance,
            and unleash your gifts. It won’t always be easy, but if you do the
            work, you’ll discover what it really feels like to
            <i>f*ck like a goddess</i>.<br />&nbsp;
