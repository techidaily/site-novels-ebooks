            This is a book written about true life paranormal experiences and
            encounters with ghosts and otherworldly entities. The ethereal
            anomalies follow and attach themselves to people creating paranoia
            and chaos in normal peoples’ lives.<br />Lynda has been dealing with
            the phenomena for over thirty years seeking guidance and help from
            various mediums and psychics to get answers to deal with the
            paranormal. She has developed her own spiritual abilities over the
            years to assist her in warding off negative and evil ghosts to
            protect herself and her family.<br />From Out of Body Experiences
            (OBEs) to encounters with both good and evil ghosts to a Near Death
            Experience (NDE) and communicating with spirit guides, you will read
            spine-chilling accounts with the other side.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />She wants to be normal, but the spirit world has other plans.
            Tormented by Ghosts is a true story about unfortunate encounters
            with ghosts and other otherworldly paranormal phenomena that have
            greatly affected Lynda’s life. The struggles include harrowing
            encounters of unwanted Out of Body Experiences (OBEs), her Near
            Death Experience (NDE), her horrifying visit from a demonic
            apparition, and mysterious bone-chilling ghostly visits. This book
            encompasses her thirty years of coping to learn and educate herself
            to understand and utilize her spiritual abilities and tools to help
            herself and others. Her daily battle is to overcome the paranormal
            and control the abilities that she has been given! Is she seeing and
            hearing ghosts that may have a message for her or to let themselves
            be known or to simply taunt her? This is a story with many stories.
            You’ll want to sleep with the lights on because it could also happen
            to you, too…<br />&nbsp;

          Kindle EditionAbsolutely amazing. It was so good I couldn't get work
          done. I couldn't put it down. It was one experience after another so
          it was constantly extremely exciting. I can't wait to read the next
          book. I wish I had this ability.Facebook Review:SHARED ON FACEBOOK by
          Melissa Barnhart on July 14, 2016I gotta share again. You can buy it
          on amazon. I finished it. Absolutely amazing. Most books have ups and
          downs for excitement this was just exciting from beginning to end due
          to it being one experience after another. If you like ghost stories or
          people with these abilities you will love this book. No doubt about
          it.
