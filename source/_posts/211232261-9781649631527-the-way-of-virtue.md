              >Beloved Qigong master Robert Peng returns with meditations to
              empower you to tap into the limitless wisdom contained in your
              body.</b
            ><br /><br />“Peace on earth mirrors peace within,” says Robert
            Peng. Yet when we bring energies of disharmony into our lives—like
            stress, trauma, and discord—those energies take up residence in our
            bodies and minds. Feelings of isolation and disconnection, according
            to Peng, are manifestations of a divided mind. Fortunately, the
            answer for restoration is all around us in the form of life-giving
            Qi. With <i>The Way of Virtue</i>, this renowned teacher presents a
            hands-on guide to Qigong meditations designed to channel healing
            energy precisely where it’s most needed—and make room for the
            abundant virtues that naturally arise from a balanced body.<br /><br />Peng
            expertly describes the nature of the mind and guides you toward the
            awakening of Spirit, offering the opportunity to cultivate a
            consistent practice and invite profound changes in well-being.
            Through his lucid descriptions, along with illustrations and audio
            guidance, he presents Qigong meditations focused on the organ system
            and meridian network, as well as healing sounds, paving the way to a
            deeper connection with one’s spiritual practice. Here you’ll learn
            which emotions are stored in specific organs, along with practices
            to draw in Qi to awaken and empower your bodymind. As you engage in
            these practices, you’ll unleash the virtuous qualities of every
            internal organ: courage, kindness, resilience, and much more.<br /><br />Building
            to the final three meditations, you’ll be guided to awaken
            particular aspects of the mind and their related virtues,
            including:<br /><br />• <i>The Six Healing Sounds </i>to awaken
            Higher Mind for goodwill<br />•
            <i>The Twelve Meridian Empowerment</i> to awaken Pure Mind for
            benevolence<br />• <i>Huo Lu Gong Spirit Cultivation</i> to awaken
            Spirit for peace<br /><br />“Our bodies contain the virtues that our
            world needs,” shares Robert Peng. Meditation is a powerful means to
            awaken these qualities and harmonize our connection to the world.
            When suffused with Qi, every cell becomes charged with vitality and
            benevolence—and you will radiate this nourishing energy wherever you
            go.

          “It is impossible to express in a few lines the breadth and depth of
          this remarkable book. In <i>The Way of Virtue</i>, Robert Peng has
          brought to life those ancient Daoist and Buddhist teachings that can
          transform our understanding and way of being in the world. He writes
          with an accessible simplicity that lays out a profound map of
          spiritual insight and invites us to engage with life-changing
          practices that have borne fruit for thousands of years. His many
          examples are incisively apt, often expressed with a lightness and
          humor that captivates the reader. It’s rare to come across a book that
          is so comprehensive in its scope, so practical in its application, and
          so inspiring in its effect. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to
          explore for themselves the great illuminating mystery of Dao.” —<b
            >Joseph Goldstein</b
          >, author of <i>Mindfulness</i><br /><br />“It is not surprising that
          the classic of Daoism is called The Classic of the Way and Its Virtue,
          because it is, after all, virtue and behavior that reveal our
          philosophy of life and allow us to be of service in the world. Robert
          Peng’s <i>The Way of Virtue</i> is an expression of this great truth.
          His book masterfully intertwines ethics and Daoist wisdom, providing
          tangible and practical insights into everyday life. The inclusion of
          transformative practices like the Wogu hand seal, the Ong Ahh Hong
          chant, and nuanced descriptions of Healing Sounds enriches the
          narrative, making it a compelling read. Whether you are new to Asian
          healing arts or an experienced practitioner,
          <i>The Way of Virtue</i> will inspire and guide you to a new level of
          understanding and vibrant well-being.” —<b>Kenneth Cohen</b>, author
          of <i>The Way of Qigong </i><br /><br />“<i>The Way of Virtue</i>
          teaches meditation that goes beyond the mind and leads into the wisdom
          of the body. It teaches us how to awaken the Spirit and reengage the
          world from this awakened space. I particularly loved the journey
          Robert Peng takes his readers on through the wisdom of the meridians.
          I highly recommend this masterpiece to everyone, from the novice to
          the experienced seeker.” —<b>Donna Eden</b>, author of
          <i>Energy Medicine</i><br /><br />“Robert Peng, a master of Qigong,
          shares his deep understanding of this spiritual art with us in
          <i>The Way of Virtue</i>. This is a marvelous guide in the universal
          journey of awakening.” —<b>Daniel Goleman, PhD</b>, author of
          <i>Emotional Intelligence </i><br /><br />“Robert Peng brilliantly
          illuminates a path through a profound ancient healing wisdom
          tradition. In a clear, insightful, and accessible way, he adapts
          Qigong principles to modern life challenges and shares the common
          sense of virtue for our lives and the world.” —<b
            >Tara Bennett-Goleman</b
          >, author of <i>Emotional Alchemy</i><br /><br />“If you’re longing to
          explore the profound mystery of existence, asking ‘Who am I?’ and ‘Why
          are we here?’ this book is for you. Poetic and practical,
          <i>The Way of Virtue</i> serves as your guide on the journey to
          greater peace. Robert Peng and Rafael Nasser blend philosophy, soulful
          stories, and meditation practices, leading readers through a
          step-by-step awakening along the Daoist path with Buddhist insights.
          This book is a supportive friend that will help you experience greater
          emptiness and wholeness with each breath.” —<b>Sharon Salzberg</b>,
          author of <i>Lovingkindness </i>and<i> Real Life</i><br /><br />
          “Robert Peng is a genius at distilling esoteric Daoist practices into
          practical, useful, and accessible teachings for everyday life. The
          world is calling for more virtue—living with a compassionate, kind
          heart. This book is truly the way to virtuous living. Use this wisdom
          as a guide to embodying ancient practices for a happy, healthy,
          fulfilling modern life.” —<b>Lee Holden</b>, author, producer, TV
          personality, and Qigong Master
