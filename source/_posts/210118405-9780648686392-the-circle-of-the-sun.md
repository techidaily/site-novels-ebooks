          Rinpoche asks: What is the starting point on the spiritual journey? It
          is possible that is seeing oneself as inadequate. It is heartening
          that the Dzogchen and Mahamudra approach says that what one wants to
          attain is already present. There is no gap between what one is and
          what one wants to attain.The starting point, which is also the end
          point of the spiritual journey is having an understanding of the
          nature of mind. In the original Tibetan text Tsele Natsok Rangdrol's
          exposition of the Dzogchen path elucidates that the path rests on the
          practices of trekchö, which means “cutting through,” and thögal, which
          means “leaping over.” Trekchö practice entails settling the mind in
          its own natural state without effort and without the rejection of
          thoughts and emotions. Thögal practice makes use of images and visions
          to realize the innate wakefulness.

          Traleg Kyabgon (1955–2012) was the founder of the Kagyu E-Vam Buddhist
          Institute, which is headquartered in Melbourne. He taught extensively
          at universities and Buddhist centers in the U.S., Canada, Australia,
          New Zealand, and Southeast Asia, and is the author of such books as
          Integral Buddhsim, Song Of Karmapa, Letter To A Friend, King Doha,
          Essence of Buddhism and Karma: What It Is, What It Isn't, Why It
          Matters. Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche IX (1955-2012) was born in Nangchen
          in Kham, eastern Tibet. He was recognised by His Holiness XVI Gyalwang
          Karmapa as the ninth Traleg tulku and enthroned at the age of two as
          the supreme abbot of Thrangu Monastery. Rinpoche was taken to Rumtek
          Monastery in Sikkim at the age of four where he was educated with
          other young tulkus in exile by His Holiness Karmapa. Rinpoche studied
          under the auspices of His Eminence Kyabje Thuksey Rinpoche at Sangngak
          Choling in Darjeeling. He also studied with a number of other eminent
          Tibetan teachers during that time and mastered the many Tibetan
          teachings with the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions in particular.
          Rinpoche moved to Melbourne Australia in 1980 and commenced studies in
          comparative religion and philosophy at LaTrobe University. He
          established E-Vam Institute in Melbourne in 1982 and went on to
          establish further Centers in Australia, America and New Zealand.
          Throughout his life Rinpoche gave extensive teachings on many aspects
          of Buddhist psychology and philosophy, as well as comparative
          religion, and Buddhist and Western thought. He was an active writer
          and has many titles to his name. Titles include: the best selling
          Essence of Buddhism; Karma, What It Is, What It Isn't, and Why It
          Matters, now translated into 5 languages; The Practice of Lojong;
          Moonbeams of Mahamudra; and many more. Rinpoche's writings are thought
          provoking, challenging, profound and highly relevant to today's world
          and its many challenges. Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche IX (1955-2012) was
