          The Book of Revelation: A New Beginning contains the hidden secrets of
          Saint Johns Revelation, and as you know, it is one of the most debated
          and most difficult books of all the scriptures to read and understand
          because of the extreme symbolism tied to it. Man has always assumed
          the word of Gods prophets and their stories were indisputable just
          because of their eminence in interpreted them as being true. Man has
          forgotten the history of himself, Earth, God, the origin of the
          universe, and how the scriptures have been documented, interpreted,
          and strictly passed down by our ancestors and religious leaders. As
          symbolic as Revelation is it has nothing to do with the end days or
          even about a solitary Anti-Christ as we understand it nor is it about
          Jesus coming to save you. In truth, Saint Johns Revelation is your own
          guide showing you that you no longer need to look at yourself as a
          sinner because you have bared your cross, like Jesus, and now the time
          has come for you to ascend to a higher state of Mind. The book of
          Revelation: A New Beginning is a book that will help open the gates of
          your soul memories so you can become aware of your own divineness, and
          that you are a God too. My fellow Gods, what is coming to an end is
          the old ways of perceiving and understanding God. It is not that God
          is a mystery. It is you that is the mystery, and when fear is resolved
          within, you are then ready to open up to the hidden secrets behind the
          Book of Revelation that religions have kept as a secret for thousands
          of years, either on purpose or because of ignorance.
