            Letters by a Modern Mystic is a collection of excerpts from the
            letters of missionary Frank C. Laubach. Written between January 1930
            and January 1932, these intimate writings show a faithful man's work
            to become closer to God through daily, hourly, and minute-by-minute
            practice.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Frank C. Laubach (1884-1970) was an American missionary and literacy
            advocate. After graduating from Princeton University (1909), Union
            Theological Seminary (1913), and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1915),
            he and his wife Emma sailed to the Philippines to begin their
            missionary life. They worked among the local Catholic population and
            spent seven years building evangelical churches on Mindanao, one of
            the largest Philippine islands. Laubach was later appointed to the
            faculty of Union Theological Seminary, helping to establish the
            campus in Manila. During this time, he wrote the book The People of
            the Philippines, a history of the islands and of religious life
            there.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            After 14 years in the Philippines, Laubach traveled to Dansalan
            (renamed Malawi in 1956) to work with the Muslim Moros people.
            Finding them resistant to his evangelical message, he thought that a
            focus on literacy would be a better method for reaching them. He
            felt that approaching the Moros people with education and "a divine
            love which will speak Christ to them though I never use his name"
            would lead to greater results. His "each one teach one" method of
            learning to read spread quickly, leading to an explosion of literacy
            on the island.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            During his time at Dansalan, Laubach was alone, his wife and son
            remaining on another island for health and education purposes.
            Laubach combatted his loneliness by writing letters to his father
            about his work, his faith, and his "deep mystic experience of
            God."&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            One might expect an evangelical Christian missionary from 1930 to be
            hostile to the ideas of another religion. But in fact, Laubach seems
            to welcome the Muslim perspective. "Living in the atmosphere of
            Islam is proving-thus far-a tremendous spiritual stimulation.
            Mohammed is helping me..." He found strength in some fundamentals of
            Islam. "Submission [to God] is the first and last duty of man [in
            Islam]", he writes. "That is exactly what I have been needing in my
            Christian life."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            He felt that he had not, to this point in his life, made enough of
            an effort to live minute-by-minute with the will of God. This
            concept of living each minute for God comes up again and again. As
            he puts it into practice, Laubach seems to find a rapture and
            connection to God and his fellow man that he's never known before.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Written as personal letters rather than as a piece of literature,
            this short work is both intimate and readable. It provides valuable
            insight into the mind of a spiritual man, as well as inspiration for
            how the modern Christian can try to lead a more Christ-filled life.
            Even his failures provide encouragement. In a letter of April 1930,
            he confesses that the constant submission to God is difficult and
            that he often falls short.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In 1935, Laubach began to spread his literacy method to other
            countries. After retiring from his missionary work, he founded
            Laubach Literacy which has helped nearly 3 million people worldwide
            learn how to read. In 2002, the program merged with Literacy
            Volunteers of America to become Pro-Literacy, which still works to
            spread the written word globally.
