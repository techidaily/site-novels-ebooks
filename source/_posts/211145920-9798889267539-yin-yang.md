            Yin Yang focuses on the yin-yang symbol's prominence in cultures
            worldwide and its immersive history. Religious leaders, meditation
            guides, award-winning authors, psychedelic therapists, and business
            executives provide in-depth conversations about the vital importance
            of healthy duality within our lives and how to bring mindfulness,
            spirituality, and harmony into effective leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rasmussen is known for making complex topics digestible for his
            readers. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from psychology and
            religion to piece together a guide to understanding the beauty of
            the yin-yang symbol and how it relates to us all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, we all need to develop feelings of self-love. We sometimes
            lose our identity in a world filled with stress, mental illness, and
            fear. A new way forward means embracing all of who we are: the dark
            and the light, the feminine and the masculine, and the rest and
            action within our authentic personas. It means accepting the
            yin-yang inside of us and expressing it to the multi-layered,
            double-sided world outside us. Rasmussen's empowering personal
            journey of reaching a lifestyle of mindfulness and equanimity is
            reflected in the hypothesis of his honest writing: To be human is
            not just to be aware of the duality within and around oneself but to
            embrace it, accept it, and use it to reach the ultimate version of
            yourself.
