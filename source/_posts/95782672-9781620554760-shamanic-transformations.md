          Inspiring accounts from renowned contemporary working shamans about
          their first moments of spiritual epiphany <br />
          <br />• With contributions by Sandra Ingerman, Hank Wesselman, John
          Perkins, Alberto Villoldo, Lewis Mehl-Madrona, Tom Cowan, Lynn
          Andrews, Linda Star Wolf, and others <br />
          <br />• Also includes shamanic awakening experiences from those with
          unique shamanic paths--teachers, mothers, social workers, academics,
          and even rappers <br />
          <br />How does one receive the “call” to enter onto the shamanic path?
          What causes some people to change their safe, uneventful, and ordinary
          lives and start on a spiritual search? For many it is a singular
          instant, a flash when the mystical reveals itself and the person is
          drawn into the world of shamanic power. For a few, it is a more
          gradual awakening, filled with numinous events that build upon one
          another until the calling of the shamanic path can no longer be
          ignored. <br />
          <br />In this book of remarkable stories, we learn firsthand about the
          many different forms of the “aha” moment of shamanic awakening,
          whether they arise from ceremony, near-death experiences, dream
          messages, or entheogenic substances. We travel alongside Sandra
          Ingerman, Hank Wesselman, John Perkins, Alberto Villoldo, Lewis
          Mehl-Madrona, Tom Cowan, Lynn Andrews, Linda Star Wolf, and other
          well-known shamanic practitioners as they begin their transformations
          into the prominent shamans we know them as. We experience the
          real-life shamanic epiphanies of those with unique shamanic
          paths--teachers, mothers, social workers, academics, healers, and even
          rappers who have all experienced a moment in time in which they were
          awakened and the shamanic path showed itself to them. <br />
          <br />As each of these unique and beautiful stories of unexpected
          realization, insight, and inspiration unfolds, we see how these single
          moments--usually entirely unexpected--are able to transform the
          individual’s life, clearing their vision and allowing a new
          consciousness to emerge. As a whole, this collection paints a
          breathtaking portrait of the intricacies of the shamanic path and the
          paradigm shift of which we all are part.

          waiting somewhere or just stealing a few moments on a lunch break.
          Either as a gateway into your own personal journey or simply for a
          good overview of modern day shamanism,
          <i>Shamanic Transformations</i> is a great read. Highly recommended.”
