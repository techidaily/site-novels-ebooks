            >In some spaces we feel immediately comfortable while in others we
            feel ill at ease. From feng shui we’ve learned that energy in
            houses, as well as offices and stores, influences us. Negative
            energy from violence and trauma can linger, which is what we feel in
            a sick” house.</b
          ><br /><br />We each affect the world, and each other, with our
          emotions! When we experience strong emotions, such as anger, fear or
          pain relating to a death or other trauma, we exude strong negative
          energy patterns. Some energetic situations can be overpowering, and
          our homes can hold lasting impressions of the previous inhabitants.
          People are often affected by the feelings they experience in a new
          homes, and frequently adjust their lives to accommodate such undesired
          imprints. We humans are energetic beings. Our energies positive and
          negative -- are strongest in our homes, where we spend the most time
          and where very personal events tend to happen, like abuse and death,
          as examples. When we move on, such negative energies linger and can
          affect new residents. HEALING HOUSES shows how a professional cleanses
          these energies to transform such sick houses into healthy homes.<br /><br />HEALING
          HOUSES tells how negative energies, overpowering feelings and physical
          effects remaining in a house from violent and tragic deaths, murders,
          and suicides. More importantly, HEALING HOUSES shows how the negative
          energy can be resolved and dispelled, so that the house feels like
          new, and tuned to current residents, rather than to the predecessor's
          traumas. The house itself changes as vibrational patterns that have
          been left by years of negative emotion, violence or death are
          cleansed. HEALING HOUSES includes a fascinating case history long-term
          where recurring attacks by bird and rats stopped after house
          cleansing. <br /><br />HEALING HOUSES provides a sophisticated
          metaphysical perspective and traces its development through case
          studies of dozens of the houses that Sheldon Norberg has "healed" or
          cleansed. HEALING HOUSES is a true healing odyssey.<br />
