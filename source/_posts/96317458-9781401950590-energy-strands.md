            >The bestselling author of <i>Soul Coaching</i
            ><br /><br />“Discovering and releasing the energy cords that don’t
            empower you is a voyage of letting go . . . and stepping into the
            flow of life.”<br /></b
          ><br />Native shamanic traditions tell us that there are cords,
          strands, threads, and filaments of energy that flow to and through us,
          connecting us to everyone and everything in the Universe. Some energy
          strands make us feelvibrant and alive. Others deplete and weaken us.
          Most of us are unaware of these energy strands, but they are extremely
          powerful forces that surround us every day.<br /><br />In her latest
          book, <i>Energy Strands</i>, Denise Linn shows you how to release the
          cords that bind you and strengthen the ones that heal you. She shares
          methods she’s personally practiced over the years to help you achieve
          peaceand balance in your life, including how to:<br /><br />• discover
          attachments to family, friends, lovers, past-lives, and pets<br />•
          cut energy strands with toxic people and unhealthy relationships<br />•
          activate specific techniques to protect and shield your energy
          field<br />• use space clearing methods to create harmony in your
          home<br /><br /><i>Energy Strands</i> explores the connection between
          the chakras, breath, meditation, visualization, sound healing, and
          more. Using a variety of tools, including dowsing, smudging, singing
          bowls, crystals, and much, much more, you’ll begin to renew your
          energy, replenish your inner sources, and magnify the cords that
          empower you.

          “<i>Energy Strands</i>, in my opinion, is one of the most in-depth
          books ever written defining energy and how to use or misuse it. Denise
          Linn masterly weaves together ageless, divine, and sage wisdom to
          assist your soul in its enduring journey while on earth. When put into
          use, the tools she generously shares will assist you in experiencing a

          “<i>Energy Strands</i> is a grounded, practical, and much-needed
          manual for caring for ourselves while navigating the morass of human
          energetic interaction. A must-read for anyone wanting to live a calm,
          peaceful, and grounded life in the midst of so much stress in the
          world. I’ll keep my copy by my bedside.”<br />

          away, then you know what it means to have an energy cord depletion.
          Denise Linn knows about energy. She’s studied itfor a lifetime, and
          she teaches you how to protect your energy field as well as how to

          how the intricate energy cords that are part of us and the Universe
          work—but it also teaches you that life is one big continuous circle of
          giving and receiving energy. You can be in control of this wonderful,
          intelligent energy and use it to guide you on your path toward
          happiness, prosperity, and well-being. This book is a must for your

          “<i>Energy Strands</i> is probably the most valuable book in the world
          that we are living in today. It helps us all understand that our
          connectionis far deeper than what we perceive it to be. It proves that
          we are all interwoven in the subliminal, and yet when we need
          something or someone needs us, energy never lets us down, it’s right
          there staring at us. That’s the beauty of energy! A gorgeous book
          that’s going to be on my list of ‘must-reads’ for all my students.”<br />–

          healed. I love this book.”<br />

          people around me, and given me a whole new set of spiritual tools that
          I can use to live a happier, healthier, more magical life—and it will
