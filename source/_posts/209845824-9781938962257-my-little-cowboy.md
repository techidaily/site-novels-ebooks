            This book is the true story of a life that Roger once lived that
            unfolded to him in a very unusual way. While driving to work, the
            first part came to him as a waking dream lasting little more than a
            few seconds. Two months later the rest of the story came in a
            similar way. The odd thing was that these felt more like memories
            than just two waking dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; In 2005 Roger set out to collect all of his notes and
            recollections to create My Little Cowboy. It took seven years for
            Roger to discover all of the connections between that story and his
            emotionally complicated present life.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; This is a book about reincarnation. Roger recounts the story
            of Alexander Johnson, his wife Martha and his children who lived in
            the 1800's. The story focuses on Alexander's family life from his
            childhood through his marriage to Martha. It continues as Alexander,
            Martha and their first son, Alex travel from New York to the West.
            Things get interesting as Alexander's family grows and many years
            later vilainy threatens to destroy his family. After the 1800's life
            ends, it continues briefly in the 1940's and then finally in the
            1950's.

          Roger has quite a story to tell. It's his story; well, at least it's
          his story past and present, a story that has spanned several
          lifetimes. Roger's story began as Alexander, a banker who lived in the
          mid-1800s. Roger as Alexander tells a story of love, adventure, and a
          search for a beloved prodigal son, a search that ends in tragedy.
          Alexander's soul seeks reconciliation with his loved ones from the
          1800s and, finally, he is reborn as Roger and his story unfolds in
          Roger's dreams, in Roger's re-connection with the souls of his beloved
          family in the 1800s. It is a compelling story of two lifetimes, two
          people, one soul. The plot sounds complicated, and, I'm sure, as the
          story unfolded in Roger's dreams, it seemed complicated. The very
          notion of reincarnation is a complex one, a controversial topic, one
          that inspires many varying degrees of belief and disbelief. One can
          easily become entrapped and confused by the quagmire of multiple
          lifetimes. The interesting thing about Roger's story, however, is the
          way he tells it. My Little Cowboy is Roger's search for his prodigal
          son, his 'little cowboy' of the 1800s. It's a journey that began when
          Roger was three and started wandering the streets around his house
          looking for his 'little cowboy', much to the bafflement and concern of
          his mother. Although Roger's journey began as a three-year-old, he
          tells his story from the beginning, in the mid-1800s when Alexander
          meets Martha, falls in love, marries and has children. It is a classic
          romance. Roger demonstrates the supreme creative art of good
          storytelling and the reader, whether a believer or not in
          reincarnation, is captivated from the first sentence: "September 23,
          1864. He is almost alone in the town square waiting for the
          stagecoach...." Roger Mendoza is a Software Engineer in the Aerospace
          Industry. He has always been interested in understanding the
          philosophy of life, the paranormal, psychics, hypnosis and past lives.
          His art of storytelling is evident in My Little Cowboy, Roger's first
          book. My Little Cowboy is a genuinely captivating story that holds the
          reader's attention to the very end. An exceptional story, My Little
          Cowboy is highly recommended by award-winning author and Allbooks
          reviewer, Emily-Jane Hills Orford, Allbooks Reviews,
