          The evidence in this book may not ultimately give you the “smoking
          gun” you are looking for on your journey, but I guarantee it will give
          you a box of bullets when you find it.<br /><br /><br />In 1996, John
          Greenewald, Jr. began researching the secret inner workings of the
          U.S. Government at the age of fifteen. He targeted such agencies as
          the CIA, FBI, Pentagon, Air Force, Army, Navy, NSA, DIA, and countless
          others.<br /><br />Greenewald utilized the Freedom of Information Act
          (FOIA) to gain access to more than two million pages of documents.
          This archive includes information relating to UFOs, the JFK
          Assassination, chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and top
          secret aircraft. He took the millions of pages, and over the course of
          more than two decades, has built an archive known around the world, as
          The Black Vault.<br /><br />Inside The Black Vault: The Government’s
          UFO Secrets Revealed takes you on a journey within the secret world of
          unidentified aerial phenomenon that has plagued the military since at
          least the 1940s. Declassified records prove that the UFO topic is one
          of the most highly classified and most elusive subjects the U.S.
          Government has ever dealt with. Each chapter explores various agencies
          and their documents, and Greenewald breaks down the meaning of why
          some of the most important documents are relevant to proving a massive
          cover-up.<br /><br />Along with declassified documents, Greenewald
          outlines the struggle it took him to get them. No other topic has
          proven so difficult, in more than 8,000 FOIA requests that he has
          filed. He explores why that might be and meets skeptics and debunkers
          head on, outlining why some of their more prominent rebuttals for it
          all cannot be true.
