            >A practical and playful guide for cultivating mindfulness in kids,
            with 50 simple games to develop attention and focus, and to identify
            and regulate emotions<br /><br /></b
          >Playing games is a great way for kids to improve their focus and
          become more mindful. In this book, <i>The Mindful Child</i> author
          Susan Kaiser Greenland shares how parents, caregivers, and teachers
          can bring mindfulness into the classroom or home. She provides 50
          entertaining games that develop what she calls the new “A, B,
          C’s”—Attention, Balance, and Compassion—for your child’s learning,
          happiness, and success, offering context and guidance throughout. She
          introduces:<br /><br />•&nbsp;Anchor games that develop
          concentration<br />• Visualization games that encourage kindness and
          focus<br />•&nbsp;Analytical games that cultivate clear thinking<br />•&nbsp;Awareness
          games for sensory awareness, self-regulating emotions, and gaining
          insight into ourselves, others, and relationships<br /><br />Even
          though the games are designed for kids, they can be just as fun and
          transformative for adults. Greenland encourages parents and caregivers
          to develop their own Attention, Balance, and Compassion and to explore
          the universal concepts that she presents. Our own mindfulness has a
          powerful effect on everyone in our lives—especially our children.<br /><br /><br />“A
          wonderful, fun, and engaging way to bring mindfulness into a child’s
          life.” <b>—Daniel Goleman, author of <i>Emotional Intelligence</i></b>

          “<i>Mindful Games</i> is a remarkable book. It interweaves engaging
          and practical mindfulness exercises for children with a sophisticated
          and nuanced exploration of the psychology and insight wisdoms
          underlying them. This book is an invaluable resource for anyone with
          children in their lives—indeed, for anyone at all. Highly
          recommended.”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“Children who are born and grow up in today’s world face
          unprecedented psychological challenges that are not of their own
          making, but were thrust upon them by earlier generations. This means
          that we adults have a moral responsibility to do all we can to help
          young people develop the cognitive and emotional skills that will
          enable them not only to survive but to flourish in the world they have
          inherited from us. Susan Kaiser Greenland’s <i>Mindful Games,</i> is a
          very welcome and important companion volume to her groundbreaking
          earlier book <i>The Mindful Child.</i> I recommend it highly for its
          bountiful wisdom and skillful means, based on many years of her
          pioneering work in this field.”<br /><b

          <i>Mindful Games</i> is not only a fun way to teach and learn
          mindfulness but a truly wise way as well. Buy an extra copy because
          <i>Mindful Games</i> is destined to be one of the most beloved,
          well-worn references for parents, professionals, and kids alike.”<br /><b
            >—Christopher Willard, PsyD, author of <i>Growing Up Mindful</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Wise, practical, captivating, and fun,
          <i>Mindful Games</i> blends a life’s work of the devoted, humble, and
          brilliant Susan Kaiser Greenland into an at once useful and
          fascinating masterpiece. Illuminating ancient contemplative principles
          and applying them for serious and playful everyday use in practical
          exercises for youth and their families, this magnificent book offers
          us a powerful means for utilizing science-proven ways to strengthen a
          child or teen’s mind by supporting the development of their brains and
          interpersonal relationships.&nbsp;You may even find, as I have, that
          these insightful ideas and games will enhance your own life as well.
          Soak in these words of wisdom, and enjoy the journey!”<br /><b
