          A great deal has been written about the history of witchcraft, but
          much of what has been written is unreliable, exaggerated, or
          inaccurate. This problem is especially acute in regard to modern
          witchcraft, or Wicca, and its supposed connections to historical
          witchcraft in medieval and early modern Europe. The A to Z of
          Witchcraft provides a reliable reference source for both academics and
          general readers interested in the actual historical development of
          witchcraft in the western world. The focus of the dictionary is on
          Western Europe during the late-medieval and early modern periods, when
          the specific idea of diabolical witchcraft developed and when the
          so-called 'great witch-hunts' occurred. Entries are also provided that
          deal with magic and witchcraft in the earlier Christian period and
          classical antiquity, as well as with the lingering belief in
          witchcraft in the modern world, and with the development of the
          modern, neo-pagan religion of witchcraft, also known as Wicca. For
          comparative purposes, some entries have been provided that deal with
          aspects and systems of magic found in other parts of the world that
          seem to bear some relation to the idea of witchcraft as it developed
          in Christian Europe. The regions dealt with are mainly Africa, along
          with such New-World practices as Voodoo and Santeria. Entries in the
          dictionary cover important people in the history of witchcraft, from
          the medieval inquisitors and early modern magistrates who developed
          the stereotype of the historical witch to the modern individuals who
          have developed the religion of Wicca. Also included are legal terms
          and concepts important to the prosecution of the supposed crime of
          witchcraft, and religious and theological concepts pertaining to the
          demonic elements that came to be associated with witchcraft, as well
          as more popular beliefs and aspects of common folklore and mythology
          that became attached to the developing idea of witchcraft. Geographic
          entries are also included, discussing the scope of witch-hunting in
          various regions of Europe and the world, and describing specific
          examples of major witch-hunts such as those that occurred in Salem,
          Massachusetts.
