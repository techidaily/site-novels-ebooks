          "Liz's focus on an intuitive approach to tarot means we can naturally
          connect with the right hemisphere of our brain through the images on
          the cards. When the right hemisphere is engaged it can override the
          doubting logic of the left, allowing us to connect to our powerful
          inner knowing - a place from which we can transform our perspective
          and grow in confidence. If ever my students wobble, Liz's tarot decks
          act like stabilizers, helping them find their own balance through
          self-belief." -
