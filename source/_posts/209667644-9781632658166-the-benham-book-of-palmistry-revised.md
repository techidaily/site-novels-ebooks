            The book that for more than a century has been the standard
            reference for reading the hand, now in a completely reformatted
            edition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Palmistry is one of the ancient arts, practiced in Egypt, India,
            Greece, and Rome and prized as a sacred and peculiar gift. Its
            practitioners were highly respected philosophers, oracles, and
            priests. Yet by the 17th century, it had become a lost art, kept
            alive almost solely in gypsy camps. And by the end of the 19th
            century, it was seen as little more than quackery, a small step up
            (or down) from fortune telling and alchemy.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it was originally published (as
            <i>The Laws of Scientific Hand Reading</i>), Benham's book
            immediately transformed the image of palm reading from a huckster's
            trick to a practice with a firm scientific basis. It quickly became
            an essential reference work for anyone serious about palm reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>The Essential Edition</i> brings Benham's original text back in
            print. It also updates many of the graphics, which have become
            obscured through numerous printings. Benham's words remain as viable
            today as they were 100 years ago, as they form the foundation of
            modern palmistry.
