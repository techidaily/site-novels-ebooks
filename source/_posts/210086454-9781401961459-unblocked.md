            >If you've ever felt like you're stuck, unfulfilled, or that you've
            been consistently "playing small"-and yet there's something inside
            you that knows you're meant to <i>do, feel,</i> and
            <i>be</i> something more -then <i>Unblocked </i>was written for
            you.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Leading empowerment coach, Margaret Lynch Raniere, has distilled years
          of experience and client success into a proven approach to help you
          overcome the blocks that stifle your potential. By leveraging the
          ancient chakra system and evidence-based Emotional Freedom Technique
          (EFT) also known as tapping, she's created a groundbreaking healing
          system to help you reclaim your inner power and transform your
          life.<br /><br />This book includes unique Healing Experiences that
          will guide you through actively unblocking the lower chakras (root,
          sacral, solar plexus, and heart). These "empowerment chakras" are the
          source of our power-and when they're blocked by long-buried pain and
          fear, we remain limited by self-doubt, procrastination, and a
          perpetual need to prove our worth.<br /><br />
          When those blocks are cleared, we finally stop "proving"-and start
          <i>being</i>-our most powerful, passionate, authentic selves. One by
          one, you'll free the "empowerment energy" contained in the chakras and
          unleash your innate superpowers. . . to be fearless and vulnerable,
          confident and real, strong and compassionate without needing to be
          "perfect."<br /><br />In addition, Harvard-trained psychoanalyst, Dr.
          David Raniere, highlights the psychology behind these transformative
          experiences, including practical tips on how to integrate them and
          elevate your level of feeling, speaking, and acting in your day-to-day
          life.<br /><br />Just imagine what you could accomplish if you
          embraced a new way of being in the world and consistently acted with
          confidence, courage, and a deep belief in yourself and your value. No
          matter where you're starting, <i>Unblocked</i> is the ultimate
          empowerment tool to help you fully inhabit your best self and create
          the life you've always wanted.

          <br /><br />If you're anything like me, you devour self help books
          like they're going out of style. If you feel like you've tried
          everything when it comes to personal growth-and nothing seems to make
          a real difference-<i>Unblocked </i>will reveal the missing piece that
          has kept you from <i>living </i>what you've learned. More importantly,
          it will lead you directly down the path of deep, lasting change.<br />

          <br /><br />In my years of working with leaders and entrepreneurs,
          I've learned that even the most successful among us are waging a
          silent battle with self-doubt . . . always trying to prove ourselves
          and secretly questioning our own worth. Margaret's approach allows us
          to free this stagnant energy and transform it into the unshakable
          confidence we need to live our best life.<br />

          >
          <br /><br />We all deeply desire to live in our power and to own our
          true worth, yet most of us go through life feeling like we're not
          enough. We try to fill the void with self-sabotaging behaviors like
          perfectionism, control, and over-work. The brilliance of
          <i>Unblocked </i>is that it goes beyond the surface and gives you
          foolproof tools to break the bonds that are holding you back so you
          can not only fill that empty space inside but you can make the
          contribution you were born to make in the world.<br />

          <i><br />Unblocked </i>is a no-nonsense approach for people who want
          to release deep emotional blocks that prevent them from living an
          exceptional life. Margaret and David's unique method focuses on the
          developmental issues associated with the lower chakras that hollow out
          the energy a person has to meet life's challenges.<br />
          The book is methodical, thorough, and thought provoking, and includes
          very powerful visualizations.<br />
          While the book is very easy to read, it is not meant for people who
          are compromised or emotionally faint of heart. <i>Unblocked </i>is for
          people who are willing and able to deal with potentially strong
          emotional reactions on their journey to improve them- selves. A person
          who dives into the ideas of the book and does the visualizations
          offered should be largely rewarded. Finally, even though the book is
          geared to the public, coaches and mental health professionals will
          find a rich treasure chest of ideas for helping others.<br />
