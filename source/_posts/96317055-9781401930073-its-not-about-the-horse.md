            >“Wyatt’s been to hell and back, and as his story unfolds, it’s
            clear that God has chosen to use this man’s life experience for the
            sake of offering hope and healing to others.”— Cheryl Richardson,
            best-selling author of <i>Life Makeovers</i><br /></b
          ><br />Wyatt Webb blends horse sense with common sense in a
          revolutionary new form of therapy. If you want to deal with your
          demons, it helps to make a pit stop in Tucson, Arizona. His tools are
          not a leather couch and a standard therapist's stopwatch that informs
          you when "time is up." Time has been up for some of his clients for a
          long, long time. They are long overdue when it comes to changing their
          lives. And they want some help. <br /><br />With Webb’s therapy, how
          you relate to the horse will tell what you’ve learned over the course
          of your lifetime and about how you relate to all living things. Wyatt
          tells his audience, "Remember one thing. It's not about the horse.
          It's about YOU." <br /><br />With his help you will learn a few ground
          skills that will keep you safe in any barn in the world. But your main
          goal is to look at what you've learned over the course of your
          lifetime and whether it works for you or against you in your
          relationships. <br /><br />Wyatt states, "The horse is the same for
          every person who chooses to be with them. The horse will serve as a
          mirror to your energy system. It's the person dealing with the horse
          who tells the whole story."

        </h4>
        <p>
          Who is Wyatt Webb? He is a native of a 250-person town in rural
          Georgia who survived two decades in the music industry as a country
          singer who toured the country 50 weeks a year. Realizing that he was
          practically killing himself due to a drug-and-alcohol abuse problem,
          Webb sought therapy, which led him to quit the entertainment industry
          to study methods of therapy. A job at his original rehab center in
          Nashville led him to become the head of the juvenile treatment program
          at Arizona’s famed Sierra Tucson facility. Eventually Webb would
          become one of the most creative, unconventional, and sought-after
          therapists in the country. He is a man whom people flock to see, and
          one whom corporations hire to solve their people problems. People are
          connected to the tall, gray-haired man, and through this bond, they
          start to reclaim parts of themselves at his (very) OK-Corral. For
          Webb, it’s all about making a connection and getting rid of self-doubt
          and fear. Those who want to connect have issues that include mental,
          physical, and emotional abuse related to marriages on the rocks;
          parent-child relationships gone bad; and much worse concerns,
          including rape and abandonment. The first step to healing is
          connecting with that large, furry beast called the horse. But how can
          a horse help you find comfort, happiness, and yourself? A horse can
          help a rape victim find peace. It can teach a power-hungry Wall Street
          executive how to relax. It can nudge a middle-aged woman who curls up
          each night with a TV and a few forgotten dreams into opening her heart
          and finding love again. For Webb’s patients, it’s not about the horse.
          It’s about the man. Wyatt is currently the founder and leader of the
          Equine Experience at Miraval, one of the nation's top resorts, which
          is located in Tucson, Arizona.
