            >Dr. Eben Alexander, author of international phenomenon
            <i>Proof of Heaven, </i>shares the next phase of his journey to
            understand the true nature of consciousness and how to cultivate a
            state of harmony with the universe and our higher purpose.</b
          ><br /><br />In 2008, Dr. Eben Alexander’s brain was severely damaged
          by a devastating case of bacterial meningitis, and he lapsed into a
          weeklong coma. It was almost certainly a death sentence, but he
          miraculously survived and brought back with him an astounding story.
          During those 7 days in coma, he was plunged into the deepest realms of
          consciousness and came to understand profound truths about the
          universe we inhabit. What he learned changed everything he knew about
          the brain, mind, and consciousness and drove him to ask a question
          confounding the entire scientific community: How do you explain the
          origins of consciousness if it is not a byproduct of the brain? His
          challenge relates to a revolutionary shift now underway within our
          modern scientific understanding. Ultimately, direct experience is key
          to fully understanding how we are all connected through the binding
          force of unconditional love and its unlimited power to heal.<br /><br />In
          <i>Living in a Mindful Universe,</i> the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Proof of Heaven </i>and
          <i>The Map of Heaven</i> shares his insights into the true nature of
          consciousness. Embracing his radically new worldview, he began a
          committed program of personal exploration into nonlocal consciousness.
          Along the way, he met Karen Newell, who had spent most of her lifetime
          living the worldview he had only just discovered was possible. Her
          personal knowledge came from testing various techniques and theories
          as part of her daily routine. With
          <i>Living in a Mindful Universe,</i> they teach you how to tap into
          your greater mind and the power of the heart to facilitate enhancement
          of healing, relationships, creativity, guidance, and more. Using
          various modalities related to meditation and mindfulness, you will
          gain the power to access that infinite source of knowing so vital to
          us all, ultimately enriching every facet of your life.

        </h4>
        <p>
          While eloquently telling us about the Mindful Universe, Eben Alexander
          and Karen Newall skillfully and beautifully drive home a timely and
          important message: You are not just part of a self-aware and ever
          evolving universe, you are the one that gives it awareness and is
          evolving it! You are your universe. The authors make the compelling
          case that the future of our world and the future vision for our
          universe lies directly in our hands and in the choices we make.<br />-Dr.
          Rudolph E. Tanzi, Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy Professor of
          Neurology, Harvard Medical School and
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Super Brain</i> and
          <i>Super Genes</i><br /><br />Eben Alexander and Karen Newell, two of
          the brightest and most sensitive people I know, have written a truly
          wonderful new book. Their book is both a personal journal of their
          spiritual quest and a practical manual for the care, education and
          nourishment of the soul. I love their brilliant, in-depth thinking and
          analysis, which sheds exciting new light on near-death experiences and
          other phenomena of the spiritual life.<br />-Raymond Moody, author of
          <i>Life After Life</i> and <i>Glimpses of Eternity</i><br /><br />In
          this important book, Eben Alexander and Karen Newell lead us on an
          unforgettable journey that opens our hearts to a deeper understanding
          of consciousness. As a neurosurgeon previously steeped in materialism
          until his beliefs were shattered by a near death experience, Alexander
          is in a unique position of being able to provide a more comprehensive
          description of the true nature of reality than conventional science or
          spirituality can offer, which he delivers with great elegance within
          the pages of this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is
          interested in gaining a deeper understanding of our true nature;
          especially those who are not afraid of breaking down the boundaries
          between our scientific and spiritual beliefs. <br />-Anita Moorjani,
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Dying To Be Me</i
          ><br /><br />Having previously accepted the philosophy of 'scientific
          materialism' as the ultimate truth, Dr. Alexander found that his
          life-transforming near-death experience during coma had shattered all
          of his former beliefs about the nature of consciousness, the roles of
          the mind and brain, and the meaning of life and death. His emergent
          understanding is presented in <i>Living in a Mindful Universe</i>,
          which illuminates the many steps he took to expand his understanding
          of a much larger, richer, and deeper cosmos.<br />-Bill Guggenheim,
          co-author of<i> Hello from Heaven</i><br /><br />Similar to Einstein,
          Eben, a man of science, delves into the Spiritual Oneness. He realizes
          that there are many paths up the mountain and they end up in the same
          place. As a result of understandings that Eben encountered during his
          coma, he succinctly conveys familiarity with many planes of
          consciousness, and the way he demonstrates this awareness is
          fascinating.<br />-Ram Dass, author of <i>Be Here Now</i
          ><br /><br />Numerous books have been written about consciousness,
          mind, soul, and love, but nobody has put them together in such an
          ingenious way as Dr. Eben Alexander. His book
          <i>Living in a Mindful Universe</i> will bring its readers a road map
          for life that is desperately needed in these times of stress,
          conflict, and confusion. It not only deals with life after death but
          how to live a more meaningful existence right here and right now.<br />-Stanley
          Krippner, Ph.D., Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University, and
          co-author of <i>Personal Mythology</i><br /><br />Dr. Eben Alexander’s
          case history is one of the most important in the history of medicine.
          The fact that he physically survives his illness is astonishing, but
          his account of a journey during his coma to a resplendent domain that
          operates according to the principle of boundless love is even more
          surprising. Alexander’s experience shows that the dismal, vacuous view
          of materialism, which guarantees total annihilation of consciousness
          with physical death, is almost certainly wrong. Newell’s contributions
          are a valuable addition, making possible a practical blueprint by
          which one can realize transcendent insights and spiritual growth
          without experiencing the dangerous trauma of Alexander’s journey.
          Their collaboration makes<i> Living in a Mindful Universe</i> vital
          reading as we struggle to recover direction, purpose, and meaning in
          modern life.<br />-Larry Dossey, MD, author of
          <i

            Consciousness and Why It Matters</i
          >
          and Executive Editor,
          <i>Explore: The Journal of Science and Healing<br /></i><br />A very
          important book, with rich stories illustrating a world beyond the
          limits of materialistic science and one Neurosurgeon’s quest to
          rethink everything he has learned. Dr. Alexander’s humbleness, along
          with the wise council of Karen Newell, is a roadmap for those wishing
          to bridge science and spirit and enter into a life of wonder and
          magic. And, it’s great read!<br />-William Arntz, creator of
          <i>What the BLEEP Do We Know!?</i><br /><br /><i
            >Living in a Mindful Universe</i
          >
          is a compelling introduction to a vitally important and rapidly
          unfolding paradigm shift in science. It highlights the decline of a
          nihilistic worldview held by scientists for centuries, where
          consciousness was a meaningless side effect of brain activity, to the
          rise of a far more comprehensive worldview where consciousness is the
          fundamental "glue" that defines reality itself. <br />-Dean Radin,
          PhD, Chief Scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences,
          Distinguished Professor at the California Institute of Integral
          Studies, and Co-Editor-in-Chief of <i>Explore</i><br /><br /><i
            >Living in a Mindful Universe</i
          >
          goes beyond Dr. Alexander’s previous books in showing how science and
          spirituality are coming together to give us a more complete
          understanding of consciousness, meaning,and purpose in the universe --
          and in describing how we can realize our role in it.<br />-Bruce
          Greyson, M.D., Carlson Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry &amp;
          Neurobehavioral Sciences at the University of Virginia Health
          System<br /><br />In this third book based upon his extraordinary
          experiences during a coma induced by bacterial meningitis, Eben
          Alexander provides new information about the coma and its aftermath,
          connects his experiences with world-wide and world-old mystical
          traditions, and links experiences of this sort with modern
          developments in physics. He then goes on with his partnerKaren Newell
          to survey a variety of practices and technologies that may enable
          others to access these expanded states of consciousness and the
          normally latent human potentials associated with them. Many other such
          possibilities undoubtedly remain to be discovered, and time will tell
          which of the lot work best, and for whom. An exciting new journey of
          scientific self-discovery is certainly underway. <br />-Edward F.
          Kelly, PhD, Professor in the Division of Perceptual Studies,
          Department of Psychiatry &amp; Neurobehavioral Sciences at the
          University of Virginia, and lead author of
          <i>Irreducible Mind and Beyond Physicalism</i><br /><br />In
          <i>Living in a Mindful Universe</i>, Eben Alexander and Karen Newell
          explore the worlds of both science and spirit. They offer clear
          explanations of findings that challenge the Supreme Illusion of
          everyday physical reality, along with frank accounts of their own
          efforts to connect more with the Collective Mind. The result is a work
          filled with wisdom and compassion.<br />-Jim B. Tucker, MD,
          <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the
          <i
            >Return to Life: Extraordinary Cases of Children Who Remember Past
            Lives<br /></i
          ><br />I have great admiration for Dr. Eben Alexander, because he
          didn't ignore something that science cannot (currently)
          explain—namely, a detailed near-death experience when his brain was
          clinically dead. In his latest book,
          <i>Living In A Mindful Universe </i>,he shares with us what he has
          discovered about the nature of human consciousness since awakening
          from his coma, and also gives readers tools they can use to deepen
          their own consciousness. Highly recommended for anyone looking to
          harness the power of the human mind!"<br />-Kelly Turner, PhD, New
          York Times bestselling author of
          <i>Radical Remission: Surviving Cancer Against All Odds</i
          ><br /><br />With a background in neurosurgery and having had direct
          experience of non-ordinary aspects of reality, Eben Alexander is a
          unique and valuable cultural asset in our efforts to develop a more
          mature understanding of the nature of self and world. In this
          delightful and mind-opening book, Eben and Karen take us with them on
          their journey of exploration subsequent to Eben's NDE. They show that
          the insights they have had are accessible to any one of us, and that
          sane, coherent, non-materialist views of reality not only exist, but
          are no longer fringe.<br />-Bernardo Kastrup, PhD, author of<i>
            More Than Allegory</i
          >
          and <i>Brief Peeks Beyond</i><br /><br />In this impressive book, Eben
          Alexander gives us a frank and very personal account of the
          life-changing transformation following his deep-coma experience. He
          shares with us his complete flip away from scientific materialism, and
          his newly obtained insight in the mystery of the Collective Mind. He
          explains the importance to make contact with this high-ordered
          consciousness by practicing conscious awareness on a more daily basis.
          Our picture of the world will change fundamentally by the insight that
          it is all about consciousness. This perspicuously written book will
          bring deeper understanding of the nature of the human spirit, and
          gives us all a greater knowledge about the nature of reality. Highly
          recommended. <br />-Pimvan Lommel, cardiologist and author of
