          Exposes the many cycles of monument destruction and cultural
          suppression in Egypt from antiquity to the present day <br />
          <br />• Details the vandalism of Egyptian antiquities and suppression
          of ancient knowledge under foreign rulers who sought to cleanse Egypt
          of its “pagan” past <br />
          <br />• Reveals the real reason behind Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt:
          Freemasonry <br />
          <br />• Shows how the censorship of nonofficial Egyptology as well as
          new archaeological discoveries continued under Antiquities Minister
          Zahi Hawass <br />
          <br />Called the “Mirror of Heaven” by Hermes-Thoth and regarded as
          the birthplace of civilization, science, religion, and magic, Egypt
          has ignited the imagination of all who come in contact with it since
          ancient times--from Pythagoras and Plato to Alexander the Great and
          Napoleon to modern Egyptologists the world over. Yet, despite this
          preeminence in the collective mind, Egypt has suffered considerable
          destruction over the centuries. Even before the burning of the Great
          Library at Alexandria, the land of the pharaohs was pillaged by its
          own people. With the arrival of foreign rulers, both Arabic and
          European, the destruction and thievery continued along with
          suppression of ancient knowledge as some rulers sought to cleanse
          Egypt of its “pagan” past. <br />
          <br />Exploring the many cycles of destruction and suppression in
          Egypt as well as moments of salvation, such as the first registered
          excavations by Auguste Mariette, Robert Bauval and Ahmed Osman
          investigate the many conquerors of Egypt through the millennia as well
          as what has happened to famous artifacts such as the Rosetta Stone.
          They show how Napoleon, through his invasion, wanted to revive ancient
          Egyptian wisdom and art because of its many connections to
          Freemasonry. They reveal how the degradation of monuments, theft of
          relics, and censorship of ancient teachings continue to this day.
          Exposing recent cover-ups during the tenure of Antiquities Minister
          Zahi Hawass, they explain how new discoveries at Giza were closed to
          further research. <br />
          <br />Clearing cultural and historical distortions, the authors reveal
          the long-hidden and persecuted voice of ancient Egypt and call for the
          return of Egypt to its rightful place as “the Mother of Nations” and
          “the Mirror of Heaven.”
