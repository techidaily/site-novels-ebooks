          A comprehensive examination of the intertwined mythology, folklore,
          and literary history of the little people <br /><br />• Explores the
          pagan roots of dwarfs and elves and their evolution in myth and
          literature <br /><br />• Reveals the role the church played in
          changing them from fearless, shape-shifting warriors with magical
          powers into cheerful helpmates and cute garden gnomes <br /><br />•
          Traces their history from ancient Celtic and Germanic lore through
          their emergence in the literature of the Middle Ages to their modern
          popularization by the Brothers Grimm and Walt Disney <br /><br />Most
          people are familiar with the popular image of elves as Santa’s helpers
          and dwarfs as little bearded men wearing red caps, who are mischievous
          and playful, helpful and sly, industrious and dexterous. But their
          roots go far deeper than their appearance in fairy tales and popular
          stories. Elves and dwarfs are survivors of a much older belief system
          that predates Christianity and was widespread throughout Western
          Europe. <br /><br />Sharing his extensive analysis of Germanic and
          Norse legends, as well as Roman, Celtic, and medieval literature,
          Claude Lecouteux explores the ancient, intertwined history of dwarfs
          and elves. He reveals how both were once peoples who lived in wild
          regions as keepers of the secrets of nature. They were able to change
          their size at will and had superhuman strength and healing powers.
          They were excellent smiths, crafting swords that nothing could dull as
          well as magical jewelry, and often entered into the service of lords
          or heroes. They were a part of the everyday life of our ancestors
          before they were transformed by fairy tales and church texts into the
          mythical creatures we know today. <br /><br />Lecouteux shows how, in
          earlier folklore, elves and dwarfs were interchangeable, gradually
          evolving over time to express very different kinds of beings. “Dwarf,”
          “giant,” and even “elf” did not necessarily connote size but referred
          to races with different skills. Elves were more ethereal, offering
          protection and kindness, while dwarfs reflected a more corporeal form
          of spirit, often appearing as messengers from the underworld. Yet
          dwarfs and elves could be bargained with, and our ancestors would
          leave a broken object outside the door at night with the hope that a
          dwarf or elf (or other local spirit) would repair it.
          <br /><br />Revealing the true roots of these helpful and powerful
          beings, including an in-depth exploration of one of the most famous
          dwarf/elf/fairy beings of the Middle Ages, Auberon or Oberon, also
          known as Alberich, Lecouteux shows how the magic of dwarfs and elves
          can be rekindled if we recognize their signs and invite them back into
          our world.

        </h4>
        <p>
          “In <i>The Hidden History of Elves</i> and Dwarfs Claude Lecouteux’s
          wide-ranging knowledge and insights are focused upon a significant
          part of European magical tradition and mythology, the realm of what he
          calls ‘lower mythology,’ of which the dwarfs are the best-known and
          most persistent characters. In Northern Tradition mythology, dwarfs
          are best known for making precious and magical artifacts such as
          Odin’s spear, Thor’s hammer, Freya’s necklace, and the golden-bristled
          boar of the gods. Apart from making jewelry, weapons, and armor for
          the gods, the dwarfs have their own magical attributes. Aubéron has a
          bow whose arrows always hit the target, an impenetrable chain-mail
          coat, a horn, and magic cup. <br /><br />Dwarfs are remembered in
          ancient Scandinavian place-names, and folktales from all over Europe
          embed the memory of dwarfs in the fabric of storytelling. Emerging
          from dense forests, mysterious lakes, burial mounds, and hollow
          mountains, sometimes they aid humans, but often they are unreliable
          assistants, for they have their own agendas. They exist within a world
          of fluid boundaries where transformation plays a major role.
          <br /><br />Denizens of an otherworld that interpenetrates the human
          world, dwarfs and elves were demonized by churchmen and conflated with
          Biblical evil powers. The realm of elves and dwarfs was much wider and
          far more diverse than that. Claude Lecouteux defines the real
          difference between sprites, elves, dwarfs, duses, trolls, and various
          forms of giants that existed in human perception before their
          demonization. <i>The Hidden History of Elves and Dwarfs</i> is
          essential reading for everyone who has ever wondered exactly what
          dwarfs are and where they come from.”
