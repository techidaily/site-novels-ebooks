            —Jason Miller, author of <i>Consorting with Spirits</i> and other
            books and courses</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>Mysteriorum Libri Quinque</i>—the
          <i>Five Books of Mysteries</i>—written by John Dee in the 16th
          century, remains to this day one of the most important core texts of
          occult literature and a comprehensive guide to Enochian magic,
          encompassing language, symbolism, rituals, and practical techniques.
          This deluxe Weiser Ankh edition is a compilation of John Dee’s secret
          spiritual treatises and was prepared from the original manuscript
          (preserved in the British Library) in Dee’s own handwriting.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          These secret writings were discovered long after John Dee’s death (c.
          1609); they had been tucked away in a hidden compartment of an old
          wooden chest and were remarkably spared from destruction—uncovered
          only a few years before the Great Fire of London in 1666. In these
          five secret treatises, John Dee, one of the most renowned scholars of
          the Elizabethan era, records in minute detail his research into the
          occult.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Throughout his life, Dee had kept concealed his writings on the nature
          of humankind’s contact with angelic realms and languages. In this
          comprehensive work, Joseph Peterson presents a brief biography of John
          Dee, detailing his work in astronomy, mathematics, navigation, the
          arts, astrology, and the occult sciences, and calling him a “true
          Renaissance man.” Although this present work is concerned primarily
          with Dee's occult experiments, through it, we catch many glimpses of
          Elizabethan life and politics.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>Mysteriorum Libri Quinque </i>presents Dee’s main
          achievement: five books, revealed and transcribed between 1581 and
          1583, detailing his system for communicating with the angels and
          bringing to light mysteries and truths that scholars and adepts have
          been struggling to understand and use ever since. While Dee’s
          influence was certainly felt in his lifetime, his popularity has grown
          tremendously since. His Enochian system was used and adapted by the
          Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and subsequently by Aleister
          Crowley.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />

          and expanded. It includes new commentary that reflects twenty years of
          research by editor Joseph Peterson, corrections to the text based on a
          review of high-resolution scans of the original manuscripts only
          recently made available by the British Library, new appendices
          reflecting more recent scholarship, and translations of the many Latin
          passages and extensive footnotes, making this work more accessible to
          readers.
