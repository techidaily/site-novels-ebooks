            This book is based on encounters with Higher Intelligence and
            highlights the questions of energy evolution for plants, minerals,
            and human body forms; along with the subject of our possibility for
            immortal existence. The reader of this book will find how the
            information received influences the development of the human shells
            [human physical and spiritual bodies], and how low Levels impact the
            perfection of souls in a negative way, along with damaging effect of
            ignorance, in addition to many other details.

          As a non-fiction author, producer and coach, I create texts, podcasts
          and videos on current topics in science and research (e.g. for
          Stifterverband). Over the years I have been able to "meet" some great
          thinkers in the humanities who provide courage, knowledge and
          guidance, especially in challenging times. I think, for example, of
          Tolstoy, Heraclitus, Lessing, Schelling, Rilke and Goethe, but also of
          the books of Muhammad Asad, the courageous reformer of Islam at the
          beginning of the 20th century, or of the political views of Pepe
          Mujica, former president of Uruguay, the great humanist of our time.

          What might once have seemed "strange" turns out decades later to be
          fundamental and even necessary. This is why, for example, the works of
          Baruch Spinoza, Adalbert Stifter, Nikolaus von Küs, Jacob Böhme and
          Blaise Pascal are being rediscovered in our time.
        </p>
        <p>Why am I writing this to you?</p>
        <p>
          I want to recommend to you two Russian authors whose work may at first
          glance seem "unconventional". Rarely has any new system of thought and
          knowledge so awakened me and brought me to a new way of thinking and
          feeling - a new way of being - as reading and understanding the books
          of L. Seklitova and L. Strelnikova. In the Russian cultural sphere
          there were often new impulses that seemed mysterious to
          contemporaries, the deep meaning of which could only be revealed by
          careful study. This is what happened to me when I became acquainted
          with the books of these two authors. I ask you to consider including
          in your collection the most significant works by L. Seklitova and L.
          Strelnikova, which have already been translated.
        </p>
        <p>First of all, thank you for taking the time to read this letter.</p>
        <p>
          May you take the time to give this new work a chance to prove itself -
          to overcome the first possible obstacle in the form of provocation in
          the first minutes of reading. Perhaps it will prove useful to you.
        </p>

          "All of society's problems, and first and foremost family problems,
          are related to the neglect of moral and ethical standards. People all
          over the world were deprived of commandments in the 80s and 90s of the
          last century. They destroyed everything, offering nothing in return,
          except a sexual revolution and an imaginary freedom. But the fate of a
          ship without a rudder and without wind is a sad one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sense, the authors L.A. Seklitova and L.L. Strelnikova, whom
          you already know, made a wise decision. I remember, that they are
          mother and daughter, who have been working diligently in this
          problematic field since 1992. Their whole family united, of course,
          together with the head of the family A.I.Strelnikov, not only examined
          in detail and at the highest level the problems of the family,
          childhood, motherhood and fatherhood, to the level that our science
          has not yet reached, but also presented the wonderful Family Code.
          They developed together with their Celestial Masters the basic
          principles of the construction of the family of the present and, what
          is more important, of the future".&nbsp;&nbsp;

          "In the interpretation of the concept of "spirituality" one could not
          agree more with L.A. Seklitova and L.L. Strelnikova who are of the
          opinion that spirituality - is a special kind of pure energy. As the
          authors formulate a person can produce this energy throughout life,
          doing good deeds and acquiring spiritual knowledge".
