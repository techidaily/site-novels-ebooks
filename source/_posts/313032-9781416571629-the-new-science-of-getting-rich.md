          Straightforward and easy to understand,
          <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i> asserts that all of us -- no matter
          what our circumstances -- have the ability to obtain enough wealth to
          live as we desire and to fulfill our purpose in life. <br />
          <br />
          Written nearly a century ago and recently rediscovered by Rhonda
          Byrne, creator of
          <i>The Secret, The Science of Getting Rich</i> offers clear insight on
          creating prosperity and the happiness that ensues. <br />
          <br />
          There exists a science of getting rich -- and it is an exact science,
          like algebra or arithmetic. There are also certain laws that govern
          the process of acquiring means, and once these laws are learned and
          followed, a person will prosper with mathematical certainty. This book
          carefully provides the explanation of this science and how these laws
          function. <br />
          <br />
          Each one of us naturally wants to achieve his or her full potential --
          this desire to realize our innate talents is inherent in human nature.
          There is nothing wrong in wanting to become wealthy; in fact, the
          longing for riches is really the desire for a fuller and more abundant
          life. <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i> can set you on your way
          toward reaching this goal.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Wallace D. Wattles was born in the United States in 1860, shortly
          before the Civil War. Later in life, he began his tireless study of
          the religious beliefs and philosophies of the world. It was through
          this relentless examination of such philosophers as Descartes, Hegel,
          and Ralph Waldo Emerson that he developed his own principles,
          successfully applied them to his life, and shared them with the world
          in his innovative 1910 book, <i>The Science of Getting Rich</i>. He
          died one year later. Wattlesâ€™s ideas have lived on to inspire future
          generations to greatness.<br /><br />Ruth L. Miller was ordained in
          the New Thought tradition and became the pastor of the Lifeways Center
          in Portland, Oregon, then interim assistant at Unity of Beaverton. She
          is currently serving New Thought and Unitarian-Universalist churches
          in Oregon, Washington, and California. She earned a doctorate in
          systems science from Portland State University integrating intuition
          and analysis in impact assessment and decision-making. Her MS in
          cybernetic systems from San Jose State University was earned with a
          thesis integrating intuitive methods in systems planning. Her
          certificate in environmental studies is from Long Beach State
          University and a BA in anthropology with a minor in American
          Literature was earned at the University of New Mexico. For more
