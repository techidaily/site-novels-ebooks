          Explore Lovecraft's Deep Connections to the Dark Arts Modern
          practicing occultists have argued that renowned horror writer H. P.
          Lovecraft was in possession of in-depth knowledge of black magick.
          Literary scholars claim that he was a master of his genre and craft,
          and his findings are purely psychological, nothing more. Was Lovecraft
          a practitioner of the dark arts himself? Was he privileged to
          knowledge that cannot be otherwise explained? Weaving the life story
          of Lovecraft in and out of an analysis of various modern magickal
          systems, scholar John L. Steadman has found direct and concrete
          examples that demonstrate that Lovecraft's works and specifically his
          Cthulhu Mythos and his creation of the Necronomicon are a legitimate
          basis for a working magickal system. Whether you believe Lovecraft had
          supernatural powers or not, no one can argue against Lovecraft's
          profound influence on many modern black arts and the darker currents
          of western occultism.

          "At the time of his death in 1937 H. P. Lovecraft was little more than
          a minor pulp author. He regarded himself as a failure. Three-quarters
          of a century later he is accepted as a serious figure in American (and
          World) literature, one whose standing and influence grow almost
          daily.But was he 'merely' a writer of horror stories, or was there
          something more to his works? Were his many weird beings and alien gods
          purely the products of his imagination, or did Lovecraft tap into some
          greater and more esoteric truth than the average reader of&nbsp;Weird
          Tales&nbsp;or&nbsp;Astounding Stories&nbsp;realized?In&nbsp;H. P.
          Lovecraft&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Black Magickal Tradition, John L. Steadman
          addresses this question head-on. Whether Lovecraft was himself a
          practicing, if covert, occultist, as some devotees believe, or solely
          a practitioner of the tale-spinner's art, his works fall clearly
          within the occult traditions of cultural and even supernatural beliefs
          stretching back to classical Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia.Steadman's
          scholarship is impressive and the revelations in his book may well be
          as shocking to skeptics (including me!) as they are reassuring to
          believers. I recommend this book unreservedly to any admirer of
          Lovecraft, whichever camp the reader may belong to." —Richard A.
          Lupoff, author of&nbsp;Marblehead: A Novel of H.P.
          Lovecraft&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lovecraft's Book<br /><br />"John L.
          Steadman's book is a welcome contribution to an important and
          neglected subject. Much nonsense has been written about Lovecraft's
          involvement with occultism, and Steadman brings a refreshing dose of
          reason and sanity to the discussion. His thorough understanding of
          Lovecraft's life, work, and thought, and his impressive grounding in
          all aspects of the occult tradition, make him the ideal scholar to
          address this controversial topic." —S. T. Joshi<br /><br />"They say
          truth is stranger than fiction, but is truth stranger than
          Lovecraftian fiction? John L. Steadman's in-depth look on Lovecraft
          and the occult proves that it is! A fascinating mix of literary
          criticism, subaltern history, and occult minutiae, even for
          non-occultists like myself." —Nick Mamatas, author of&nbsp;Move Under
          Ground&nbsp;and&nbsp;Love is the Law
