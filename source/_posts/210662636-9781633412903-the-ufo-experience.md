            >Cited by the <i>New York Review of Books</i> as “the best brief for
            visitation,” this classic study presents an analysis of UFO reports
            and concludes that many sightings cannot be easily dismissed.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The case against UFOs and unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) has not
          been put to rest. Although UFOs “officially” did not exist for decades
          according to the government, reports of sightings continue to be made,
          and the latest releases from the government and related hearings have
          surprised the world. While the scientific community has put UFOs out
          to pasture, the evidence used to dismiss them is rare and
          unscientific.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Dr. Hynek, a scientist himself, and the only government-paid ufologist
          in history, looks at the decisions made by officialdom in the early
          days of ufology and how these decisions have held us back—to the point
          that we are still naively talking about UFOs as we were in the 1950s.
          Has seventy years of research made no difference at all in our
          understanding?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Dr. Hynek proves that there is a conspiracy afoot to hide the facts
          and that there are many cases that still need to be explained by
          mainstream science—not dismissed with facile jokes and stupid logic.
          Citing specific cases, Hynek challenges those in the ivory tower by
          raising questions that have still not been answered and refuting
          mainstream arguments that have yet to be proven.

        <p>
          <b>J. Allen Hynek</b> (1910–1986) served as official astronomical
          consultant to the US Air Force’s Project Blue Book. He was an
          astronomer and professor of astronomy at Ohio State University and
          later became chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern
          University in Chicago. Hynek started the Center for UFO Studies
          (CUFOS) in 1973 and was largely responsible for the founding of MUFON
          (originally called the Midwest UFO Network). His books include
          <i>The Hynek UFO Report </i>and <i>The Edge of Reality.</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br /><b>Paul Hynek</b> is a Wharton MBA, an adjunct professor
          of finance and accounting at Pepperdine University, and the creator of
          startup financial projections software that has raised over one
          billion dollars for thousands of startups. Paul works with numerous
          startups as either a board member, advisor, or part-time CFO. He was
          also consultant on History Channel’s show <i>Project Blue Book</i
          ><b></b>and was the technology consultant on Discovery Channel’s
          <i>Mayne vs. Shark</i>. He is the son of J. Allen Hynek.
