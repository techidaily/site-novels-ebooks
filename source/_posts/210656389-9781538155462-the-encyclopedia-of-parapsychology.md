            It includes find information on early psychical researchers from
            around the globe and how the work of those psychical researchers
            inspired the creation of the modern field of parapsychology.
            Alongside biographical entries about key figures are sketches of
            those at the center of psychical inquiry, like mediums and others
            who seemingly have the ability to manifest strange phenomena.

          <p>
            The Encyclopedia covers the Spiritualism era which influenced early
            psychical inquiry and how it influenced psychical thought around the
            globe. More contemporary coverage includes biographical entries for
            current international researchers who continue to investigate the
            depths of psi phenomena.
          </p>

            1870s and going through the 2020s. This section includes a wide
            variety of research into topics such as psychokinesis, hauntings,
            poltergeists (also known as recurrent spontaneous psychokinesis),
            near-death experiences, extrasensory perception, remote viewing, and
            much more.

          Superbly organized and researched, this book by Block provides a
          comprehensive presentation about parapsychology. This field includes
          the study of extra-sensory perception, precognition, psychokinesis,
          near-death experiences, out-of-body experiences, mediumship, and
          ghosts, hauntings and poltergeists. Block acknowledges the ongoing
          challenge to the legitimacy of methodologies and measurements of
          parapsychology research, yet she champions the persistence and
          accomplishments of researchers and scientists who continue to explore
          phenomena that are experienced but unexplained. International in
          scope, the initial chapter covers biographies (background, field of
          study, affiliations, outcomes) of figures in the field, from pioneers
          through modern investigators, and concludes with a fascinating section
          on mediums, seers, psychometrists, and more. Other chapters include
          the history of psychic organizations and groups intent on exposing
          fraud, an annotated bibliography of parapsychology resources, and
          criticisms of the field. Each entry ends with suggested reading, and
          chapters conclude with extensive references. The marvelous appendixes
          point to topics, academic journals, and research organizations. The
          foot-noted glossary has its own bibliography. An exceptional
          first-step resource for the inquisitive reader or scholar seeking
          substantiated information about the history and status of current
          parapsychology research.
