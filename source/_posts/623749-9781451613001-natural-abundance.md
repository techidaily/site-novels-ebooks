          Dr. Ruth L. Miller interprets a few essential essays by Ralph Waldo
          Emerson that tell us how the world always responds to our thoughts,
          words, and actions, and what we can do to ensure that our life is
          truly joy-filled in all aspects. In clear, simple language, she gives
          us a direct sense of what Emerson felt, saw, and struggled to share
          with his fellow human beings.<br /><br />Emerson transcended the
          limitations of his day. Using common sense, a love of nature, and his
          own particular genius, he expressed a higher truth about who we are
          and how the world gives us exactly what we demand from it.<br /><br />Yet,
          perhaps because he was so popular, and because so much of what was
          popularized focused on the need to transcend materialism and reconnect
          with Nature, some of his core ideas were lost to later generations.
          They were there, buried in the long sentences and extended paragraphs
          of his often-overlooked essays—but were discovered only by the few who
          were willing to take the time and seek them out. These few became
          great teachers in their own right, the founders and leaders of
          institutions and movements that have changed history.<br /><br /><i
            >Natural Abundance</i
          >
          makes the hidden treasures of Emerson’s wisdom accessible to 21st
          century readers. Through it, this great man’s alignment of his heart’s
          knowing and his intellect’s understanding can lead all of us to a more
          abundantly fulfilling life, today.

          <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Ralph Waldo Emerson was the leading proponent
          of the Transcendentalist movement of the mid-nineteenth century. He
          was ordained as a Unitarian minister at Harvard Divinity School but
          served for only three years before developing his own spiritual
          philosophy based on individualism and intuition. His essay
          <i>Nature</i> is arguably his best-known work and was both
          groundbreaking and highly controversial when it was first published.
          Emerson also wrote poetry and lectured widely across the US.
