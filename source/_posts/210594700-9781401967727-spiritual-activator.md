            >A 5-step energy detox program from renowned energy healing expert,
            Oliver Nino that removes the crippling blocks from your energetic
            field that stand between you and abundance, purpose, and
            happiness.</b
          ><br /><br />Renowned energy healer and spiritual activation expert,
          Oliver Nino shares his 5-step energy reset that eliminates the toxins
          that hold you back from being in your healthiest state.<br /><br />In
          this book, Oliver explains how energetic blocks lodge themselves in
          your system as negative beliefs, emotions, and sometimes even physical
          conditions. Traumas, ancestral roots, or environmental factors create
          feelings of fear, guilt, anger, betrayal, uselessness, hurt, and
          inadequacy that can flow through you like dangerous, free radicals.
          These create walls in your energetic field, which can cause physical
          disease, relationship issues, feeling “stuck,” a lack of abundance, a
          lack of purpose, a lack of confidence, anxiety, depression, or a
          general feeling of unhappiness.<br /><br />Writes Oliver, "I find that
          when you cleanse, or remove, the blocks that weigh people down using
          my healing techniques, it not only detoxes their energetic
          fields—thus, healing various aspects of wellness—but also allows them
          to tap into a higher power and activate their own gifts, so that they
          can pursue their purpose on earth. Every one of us is naturally wired
          to clear our energy fields. Our souls arrived here in a clear,
          energetic state, and so it’s possible to return to our natural way of
          being."
