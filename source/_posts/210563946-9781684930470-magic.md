            Magic: A Treatise on Natural Occultism (1929) is a short work by
            author, mystic, and lecturer Manly P. Hall. By exploring the
            differences between black and white magic, this book seeks to guide
            fellow occultists away from those practices which damage the spirit
            and lead to the loss of the soul.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Born in Canada, Manly P. Hall (b. 1901, d. 1990) was drawn into the
            world of mysticism when he moved to Los Angeles at age 18. He
            quickly began to preach and lecture at the Church of the People.
            Soon, he was leading the evangelical congregation as its minister.
            This began a long career that spanned thousands of lectures, often
            well-attended affairs that received local coverage in the Los
            Angeles Times.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            His growing notoriety caught the attention of a wealthy woman named
            Carolyn Lloyd, who became Hall's patron. Through her support, he was
            able to travel the world, seeking education and wisdom from diverse
            cultures and acquiring rare books of philosophy and mysticism.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            As the author of over 150 books, pamphlets, essays, and countless
            articles, Hall shared what he had learned in his readings and
            extensive travels. Through his lectures and writings-particularly
            1928's The Secret Teaching of All Ages, Hall became a well-known
            philosopher and expert on mysticism and occultism. He channeled some
            of this fame and wealth into the creation of the Philosophical
            Research Society, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit learning center and
            book collection centered on metaphysics, religion, and the occult.
            Founded in 1934, the PRS is still in operation today.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Magic: A Treatise on Natural Occultism explores the differences
            between black magic and white magic-how they are practiced, the
            justifications behind both, and the inevitable results of each.
            "Motive is the key to the problem of Magic," he explains. "Even the
            greatest of White Magicians can become a degenerate in an instant if
            his motive becomes unworthy. The White Magician serves humanity; the
            Black Magician seeks to serve himself." This ulterior motive leads
            the Black Magician into selfish and destructive behaviors, rather
            than the wise and learned actions of the White Magician who seeks
            only to do good.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Through his description of black and white magic, Hall explores the
            very nature of good and evil. He argues against the personification
            of "natural principles." In his view, the Devil is not a person at
            all, but a natural occurrence, comprised of all manner of sins. He
            is "...the spirit of perversion or negation, the created principle
            of misuse."&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            As an abuser of magic, the Black Magician can indeed be said to
            serve "the two great demons of creation"-Satan (Saturn) and Lucifer
            (Mars). But the White Magician, free of selfish desire, "consecrates
            his life to study, meditation, and service....He molds himself into
            the Plan, becoming part of the divine rhythm by sacrificing himself
            and his wishes to the will of the Infinite, asking only to know
            wherein his duty lies and how he may be of the greatest service to
            the greatest number."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In Part Three of the work, titled The Mechanics of Magic, Hall
            explains the creation of the universe from the occult perspective.
            He breaks down the concepts of reincarnation, human consciousness,
            and the laws of nature, drawing on theology and philosophy from
            Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, ancient Tibet, Greece, Rome,
            Egypt, and more.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Through the writings of Manly P. Hall, students of mysticism and the
            occult find both a guide to the natural world and instruction in how
            to navigate it.
