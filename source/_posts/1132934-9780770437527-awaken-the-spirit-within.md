            >From the star of Lifetime's
            <i>The Last Goodbye</i>.<br /><br />With a unique and refreshing
            blend of self-help, wisdom, and spiritual insight, Rebecca Rosen
            helps us “wake up” and start living our lives with divine intention
            and purpose.</b
          ><br /><br />We all want to be happy and fulfilled. We want to
          understand the very point of our lives—why we’re here and what we’re
          meant to do. Yet, when we think about how to get from here to there
          and answer life’s “Big” questions, so many of us don't know where to
          begin. The advice from so many different people and sources can be
          overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. In
          <i>Awaken the Spirit Within</i>, acclaimed author and spiritual medium
          Rebecca Rosen offers us an inspired and invigorating prescriptive
          program to give our lives clarity and deeper meaning. With Rebecca’s
          down-to-earth and conversational style, this book will help you learn
          how to:&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Create more peace
          and fulfillment in your personal relationships
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Gain confidence in your natural talents
          and abilities <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Succeed in greater
          degrees at your job <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Develop financial
          abundance and prosperity <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Conquer
          addictions and negative thinking <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Find
          freedom from weight struggles and poor body image
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Gain the clarity to make the “right”
          choices and decisions for your life<br />
          <p>
            Bold claims? Yes. But when it comes to Rebecca Rosen, you’ll
            understand just after a few pages, why Time.com has told its readers
            to “Take her advice seriously.”

          "Rebecca Rosen is a talented and authentic medium. In her new book,
          <i>Awaken the Spirit Within,</i> Rebecca helps readers reconnect with
          their inner guidance system. This book is a empowering guide to your
          genuine truth, authentic power, and sustainable peace." Gabrielle
          Bernstein, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of
          <i>May Cause Miracles </i><br /><br />"This book is extremely
          inspirational and will free you if you're feeling stuck in any area of
          your life.&nbsp;&nbsp;It awakens the truth that we all have inside of
          us and will help you live a healthy happy life filled with love." --
          Vanna White, co-host of <i>Wheel of Fortune<br /></i><br /><i
            >"Awaken the Spirit Within</i
          >&nbsp;is a&nbsp;magnificent&nbsp;effort to give a hand up to everyone
          who wants to enrich their spiritual life. Rebecca gives practical
          steps to increase your intuition, better understand the universe and
          how you relate to it, and even, how to connect with the other side. I
          love this book and am so thankful to have read it!" -- Catherine Bach,
          actress<br /><br />"A very pragmatic friend of ours first told us
          about Rebecca Rosen.&nbsp; His experience was so profound, he wanted
          everyone to know about her work.&nbsp; I booked an appointment right
          away and eagerly awaited our session.&nbsp; When the day finally came
          and I had my reading with Rebecca, the main theme that came through
          for me was that as my life is changing gears, I need to get clarity
          about what I want this next phase to look like.&nbsp; Only then would
          I be able to manifest what I want.&nbsp; I think at some point we all
          realize that what we want is to be an expression of God’s love and
          light.&nbsp; This book gives tools how to do that.&nbsp; Thanks
          Rebecca!" -- Cindy Crawford<br /><br />"After attending several of
          Rebecca Rosens's group readings, and&nbsp;then having one of my own, I
          would read any book Rebecca wrote and listen to anything she has to
          say. She is mind blowingly connected to things which I can't explain,
          and it thrills me beyond imagination. &nbsp;I read Awaken The Spirit
          on my birthday recently, and it is a gift that keeps on giving. Don't
          miss out on the experience of knowing what she knows. We are lucky to
          have her as a teacher." -- Nancy Lee Grahn, actress
