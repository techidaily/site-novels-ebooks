            This story of Scattered, Smothered, and Yet Covered by the Grace of
            God tells the unknown, the unbelievable, and the hurt and heartache
            that scattered my life in 2010 with my son Nathan's dive into
            addiction. His addictions from pot to pills would scatter and
            smother me for the next eight-plus years. This isn't only a raw look
            into addiction and the destruction it causes, but more importantly,
            it is a look into a story of God's love, hope, mercy, and grace that
            covered me and Nathan during these years in addition to being
            covered by friendships and prayers when we couldn't cover ourselves.

            I learned in 2019-2020 while writing this story that there is an
            obvious thread woven within this story--that is, God was there in
            every detail along the way. I was scattered into pieces, broken
            beyond what I could have imagined, smothered to the point of true
            breathlessness, and yet covered by the grace of God each and every
            day.
          </p>

          <p>
            But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this
            all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. We are hard
            pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in
            despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not
            destroyed. We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so
            that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body. For we who
            are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so
            that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body. So then,
            death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.
          </p>

            I am thankful, Lord, for the refining and redemption lived within
            this story. I have been covered by the grace of God!
