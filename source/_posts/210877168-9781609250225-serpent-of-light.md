          ><br /><br />Every 13,000 years on Earth a sacred and secret event
          takes place that changes everything. Mother Earth’s Kundalini energy
          emerges from its resting place in the planet’s core and moves like a
          snake across the surface of our world. Once at home in ancient
          Lemuria, it moved to Atlantis, then to the Himalayan mountains of
          India and Tibet, and with every relocation changed our idea of what
          spiritual means. And gender. And heart. This time, with much
          difficulty, the “Serpent of Light” has moved to the Andes Mountains of
          Chile and Peru.<br /><br />Multi-dimensional, multi-disciplined and
          multi-lived, for the first time in this book, Drunvalo begins to tell
          his stories of thirty-five years spent in service to Mother Earth.
          Follow him around the world as he follows the guidance of Ascended
          Masters, his two spheres of light, and his own inner growing
          knowledge. His story is a living string of ceremonies to help heal
          hearts, align energies, right ancient imbalances, and balance the
          living Earth’s Unity Consciousness Grid—in short, to increase our
          awareness of the indivisibility of life in the universe. We are
          all—rocks and people and interdimensional beings—one!<br /><br />“Life
          may seem to be business as usual, but it is not. We are changing
          fast&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Remember this for life is going to present
          stranger things to you in your lifetime, and they all have meaning and
          purpose&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Only Mother Earth and ancient Maya know
          what’s going to happen.” —from <i>Serpent of Light</i>

          "In Serpent of Light, Drunvalo Melchizedek tells the story of
          indigenous people around the world creating ceremonies to relocate the
          kundalini serpent to the high Andes Mountains in Chile, an event that
          happens every 13,000 years. Spiritual ascension will only come to our
          planet if men and women are totally integrated and balanced, and
          during this next cycle, women will be the leaders. Drunvalo was chosen
          to share in critical ceremonies that were created to empower women
          because he is a man who dwells totally in his heart and truly respects
          women. As a female ceremonial teacher during these same years when
          Drunvalo was creating beautiful ceremonies within many of the same
          sacred sites with the people, I can say that Drunvalo speaks the
          truth. He offers as much closely held information as is allowed, so
          there is significant indigenous knowledge in this book. Drunvalo is a
          great storyteller! You are there with him while he follows
          synchronicities and communicates with the great guardians of the
          sacred sites. Serpent of Light is a masterful description of the great
          Earth activations that are occurring during the end of the Mayan
          Calendar." --Barbara Hand Clow, International Mayan Elder, a Cherokee
          Record Keeper, a ceremonial leader, and the author of The Mayan Code:
