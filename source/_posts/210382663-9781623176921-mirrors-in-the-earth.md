            >An award-winning nature therapy session for the soul--encounter the
            benevolence of the living world through 12 essays on the
            Earth-healing powers of self-compassion and empathy.</b
          ><br /><br /><i
            >When healing is needed at the deepest level, nature will always
            call us back home--not only to the oak woods or water-filled coves,
            but to the homes within ourselves.</i
          ><br /><br />In a series of 12 lyrical nature essays, herbalist,
          writer, and Earth intuitive Asia Suler illuminates the healing power
          of the living Earth--and gives us permission to nurture
          self-compassion and empathy as forces for personal and ecological
          healing.<br /><br />In a time of unprecedented ecological devastation,
          it’s easy to feel hopeless and disconnected. It’s easier still to mask
          our inherent goodness--to imagine that our unique and precious gifts
          simply aren’t enough, or forget the power of our inborn empathy. For
          those of us who are highly sensitive, innately attuned to the workings
          and whispers of the natural world, it can be hard to embody the belief
          that
          <i>we’re enough as we are--and that can heal the Earth</i
          >.<br /><br />Here, Suler reveals the opposite: our goodness, our
          empathy, our intuitive connections, and our capacity for
          self-compassion are more than personal traits or antidotes to despair:
          they are, in fact, our most potent vehicles for planetary
          transformation. And as we learn to more deeply nurture and accept
          ourselves, we unlock living, healing connections to Earth.<br /><br />Combining
          poetic nature writing with exercises and reflection prompts at the end
          of each essay, <i><b>Mirrors in the Earth</b></i> coaxes us to come as
          we are: to discover and tend the inherent brilliance and medicine that
          lives in each of us. From the manatee-calm springs of wild Florida to
          the flower-dotted coves of the world’s most biodiverse mountains,
          <i><b>Mirrors in the Earth</b></i> is an invitation and encounter with
          the benevolence of the living world--and a nature therapy session for
          the soul.
