          Follow Aleister Crowley through his mystical travels in India, which
          profoundly influenced his magical system as well as the larger occult
          world <br /><br />• Shares excerpts from Crowley’s unpublished diaries
          and details his travels in India, Burma, and Sri Lanka from 1901 to
          1906 <br /><br />• Reveals how Crowley incorporated what he learned in
          India--jnana yoga, Vedantist, Tantric, and Buddhist philosophy--into
          his own school of Magick <br /><br />• Explores the world of
          Theosophy, yogis, Hindu traditions, and the first Buddhist sangha to
          the West as well as the first pioneering expeditions to K2 and
          Kangchenjunga in 1901 and 1905 <br /><br />Early in life, Aleister
          Crowley’s dissociation from fundamentalist Christianity led him toward
          esoteric and magical spirituality. In 1901, he made the first of three
          voyages to the Indian subcontinent, searching for deeper knowledge and
          experience. His religious and magical system, Thelema, shows clear
          influence of his thorough experimental absorption in Indian mystical
          practices. <br /><br />Sharing excerpts from Crowley’s unpublished
          diaries, Tobias Churton tells the true story of Crowley’s adventures
          in India from 1901 to 1906, culminating in his first experience of the
          supreme trance of jnana (“gnostic”) yoga, Samadhi: divine union.
          Churton shows how Vedantist and Advaitist philosophies, Hindu
          religious practices, yoga, and Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism
          informed Crowley’s spiritual system and reveals how he built on Madame
          Blavatsky and Henry Steel Olcott’s prior work in India. Churton
          illuminates links between these beliefs and ancient Gnostic systems
          and shows how they informed the O.T.O. system through Franz Hartmann
          and Theodor Reuss. <br /><br />Churton explores Crowley’s early
          breakthrough in consciousness research with a Dhyana trance in Sri
          Lanka, becoming a devotee of Shiva and Bhavani, fierce avatar of the
          goddess Parvati. Recounting Crowley’s travels to the temples of
          Madurai, Anuradhapura, and Benares, Churton looks at the gurus of yoga
          and astrology Crowley met, while revealing his adventures with British
          architect, Edward Thornton. Churton also details Crowley’s
          mountaineering feats in India, including the record-breaking attempt
          on Chogo Ri (K2) in 1902 and the Kangchenjunga disaster of 1905.
          <br /><br />Revealing how Crowley incorporated what he learned in
          India into his own school of Magick, including an extensive look at
          his theory of correspondences, the symbology of 777, and the Thelemic
          synthesis, Churton sheds light on one of the most profoundly mystical
          periods in Crowley’s life as well as how it influenced the larger
          occult world.

        <p>
          “Relying to a large degree on unpublished documents, Churton’s
          narrative account demonstrates the extent of Crowley’s engagement with
          both the theoretical and practical dimensions of Hindu and Buddhist
          teachings and their enduring influence on his magical philosophy.
          Crowley’s efforts in conjoining the spiritual systems of the East and
          West have important implications for the study of comparative
          esotericism, and Churton deserves praise for his eloquent treatment of
          this fascinating subject.”
