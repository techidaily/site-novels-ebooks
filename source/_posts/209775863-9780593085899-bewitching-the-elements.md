          people are embracing witchcraft and other spiritual practices&nbsp;to
          tap into their inner strength and resilience, while aligning with
          something larger than themselves. The tools that Gabriela Herstik
          offers in <i>Bewitching the Elements</i> will help you connect to the
          universe and your inner light.<br /><br />Through earth, learn how to
          ground and create compassionate boundaries.<br />Through air, harness
          the breath, balance the body, and find presence in the moment.<br />Through
          fire, embody passion, burning away what no longer serves you, and
          learn to constructively work with anger.<br />Through water, explore
          your emotional depths and come back to the heart.<br />Through spirit,
          connect to your own sense of power, embracing all of the lessons of
          the elements.<br /><br />Committing to a path that serves our
          authentic selves is a radical act. When we do this work alongside
          nature, by turning to the elements, we find a map back to our
          intuitive and energetic wisdom.
