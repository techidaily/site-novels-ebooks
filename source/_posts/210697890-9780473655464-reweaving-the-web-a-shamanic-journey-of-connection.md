            This book is an exploration of Celtic shamanism, leading to a
            greater understanding of ourselves, and deepening our connection to
            the magic that life holds. Its wisdom is innate within Nature and in
            all its species. Reweaving contains wisdom that humans have long
            turned away from but is still exists, accessible individually and
            collectively, putting us back in touch with the Web of Life. In this
            economically focused world, we must find ourselves again in the
            mirrors that nature provides. 'Everything is alive, conscious and
            intelligent', able to be interacted with, and learnt from, but the
            artificial world we have created has narrowed our vision to the
            profit motive alone. In our drive to own things, we exclude
            ourselves from its&nbsp;connection. Unhealthy as this patterns is,
            it encourages physical and psychological disease, alongside the
            destruction of the Earth that sustains us.The ancient systems
            understood balance. We have lost that ability in our constant
            seeking for growth at all costs. We do not recognise the boundaries
            that the Earth has set for us, that keeps everything working
            together. Instead we have seen ourselves as superior. We have sought
            to defeat Nature rather than co-operate with her, not realizing that
            in so doing we are destroying the very basis upon which all life
            depends.. To counteract this, we need realignment with those ancient
            laws that have served us all so well since the beginning of time.
            Shamanic thought is the oldest form of understanding and a path to
            mental health.&nbsp;By attuning to its principles, we can begin the
            journey of reconnection. We so desperately need to save ourselves,
            our children, and other species, while restoring health to the
            planet as well as the overall system of life.
          </p>

            This book walks its readers through the basics, as well as some of
            the deeper esoteric teaching, that have survive over 32,000 years.
            It shows how the the ancestors saw their relationship with the
            world, and how we can connect to the wisdom of other species even in
            the modern world. The false divisions that we have constructed
            between us all have isolated the human race from the knowledge that
            is only available through the connection with others we have
            seemingly ignored. But the opportunity to reconnect is still there.
            The rest of creation just awaits our awakening so that we can learn
            from each other again, putting the pieces back together to thrive as
            a whole world. We can talk to trees, ancestors, rocks, and our own
            inner self to find the wisdom we so desperately needs.

            Being a shaman is not about what you wear, the culture that you come
            from. Neither is the understandings that shamanism offers something
            we have to study for years to attain. Deep inside us all there is
            much that our instinct and deep wisdom recognises if we just go
            looking, We can begin to draw from that well of wisdom right now.
            Reweaving the Web can help you to find your inner shaman, helping
            you to access your own knowing in your everyday life.The key to
            everything lives inside of each of us. Once we change the inside,
            the outside always follows.

        <p><strong>Reader Testimonials</strong></p>
        <p>
          "'Reweaving the Web' is a wonderful book, written with love.The
          inspirational wisdom within its words occasionally challenged me,
          often fell on me like soft rain and constantly reminded me of what I
          already knew inside-that everything is connected.Everywhere, in all
          things,there is wisdom from which I can learn. Every pebble I throw
          into the water will send out ripples that meet the most distant of
          shores. I am filled with a new appreciation of the immense amazing
          gift that is Life. I can feel myself becoming softer and stronger at
          the same time. Thank you Sparrowhawk."

          "I started to read and havent been able to put it down. I stopped
          myself at chapter 5, just so that I wouldn't gobble it up too
          quickly,and savour the words.It reads as if you are sitting next to me
          talking to me.Already you have opened some new doors for me, and for
          that, my thanks.

          "This is a fascinating journey of spiritual discovery, linking the
          past to the present and to the future, reviving old wisdom and making
          it relevant for today.There are so many of us on the same journey, who
          can take heart from someone else on the road living the difficulties
          of the journey and sharing her wisdom to help and support us on our
          journey"
