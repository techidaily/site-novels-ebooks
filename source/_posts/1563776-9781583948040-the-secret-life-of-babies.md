          A bold affirmation that we are sentient before conception and in the
          womb,&nbsp;The Secret Life of Babies&nbsp;reveals author Mia Kalef's
          groundbreaking findings: babies are able to remember their earliest
          experiences, this consciousness precedes the physical development of
          the brain itself, and medical interventions during birth—like forceps
          and Cesareans—can imprint our relationships with the world and
          disconnect us from our sustainable place in the ecosystem. Kalef
          provides a six-step protocol for detecting these individual imprints
          and taking reparative steps for physiological and emotional balance
          and release. This book offers us an articulate guide to a
          transformation that can restore our essential nature.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />From

          “A gifted healer and passionate writer, Mia Kalef combines scientific
          findings, personal intuition, and therapeutic insights for a
          fascinating view of prenatal experience and its lifetime consequences,
          the multigenerational and social influences that shape it, and the
          healing of its potentially traumatic imprints.”<br />
          —Gabor Maté, MD, author of
          <i>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Dr. Kalef's book is a work of art. It is full of tales that ring
          true, that make sense, that are full of heart, that smack of
          authenticity. Kalef masterfully mixes personal and clinical experience
          with current literature throughout, saturating the reader with a sense
          of the continuity of our lives and the meaningfulness of our adult
          behavior.”<br />
          —Michael Trout,&nbsp;director, Infant-Parent Institute<br /><br />“At
          a time when our cultural lack of understanding of the birth process
          has reached an extreme degree, the world needs practitioners such as
          Mia Kalef.”<br />
          —Michel Odent, MD, author of
          <i>Childbirth and the Future of Homo Sapiens </i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Mia Kalef provides major evidence for the existence of sentience and
          experience in the womb. She defends with good arguments that our
          collective denial of this truth impacts negatively how we deal with
          pregnancy and prenatal mother-child interaction, which itself leads to
          severe disturbances in our relationships with ourselves, each other,
          and the global community of life. She provides clear and efficient
          procedures to help us recognize and overcome early traumatic imprints
          so that we may be in harmony with the stream of life.&nbsp;This book
          is a firm and reliable plea to reevaluate the secret life of babies
          and see how they are emissaries of a lost wisdom that has the power to
          set us on a more wholesome and balanced course.”<br />
          —Jaap Van Der Wal, PhD, author of <i>The Embryo in Us, </i>and former
          professor of anatomy and embryology, University of Maastricht,
          Holland<br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          <b>“</b>Mia Kalef has written a book that brings science to a level
          from which everyone can understand and benefit. She cites interesting
          studies from around the world…animals, the human species, history,
          and&nbsp;various cultures. With vivid and yet simple depictions of how
          prenatal and birth experiences can support a person's/family's quest
          for change and health, her words remind us that it is never too late
          to heal.”<br />
          —Judyth O. Weaver, PhD, somatic and perinatal therapist, and
          co-founder and professor, Santa Barbara Graduate Institute<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “It’s a pleasure to read Dr. Kalef’s comprehensive and empathetic
          book, in which she describes the deep influences human early life have
          on later physical, emotional, and social conditions. She describes the
          social and historical backgrounds for why we don’t know this and
          invites us to her Intuitive Recovery Project for finding a new, more
          sustainable personal connection to these concepts. This great book
          helps us understand the very real social implications of the prenatal
          time and to deepen our understanding of ourselves within in it.”<br />
          —Rupert Linder, MD, past president, International Society of Prenatal
          and Perinatal Psychology and Medicine, and specialist for gynecology,
          obstetrics, psychosomatics, and psychotherapy<br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          “Dr. Mia Kalef's <i>The Secret Life of Babies </i>is an illuminating
          read, and a revelation. Not only a book for new and expecting parents,
          Kalef's book will make readers think about the circumstances
          surrounding their own birth and how this could be the basis of some of
          the traumas and inhibitions, and even addictions they experience as
          adults. Incorporating both detailed case studies and broader overviews
          of history and culture, the book is a wake-up call for people to pay
          more attention to prenatal and perinatal conditions and take a hard
          look at the way that society treats women and mothers, and ask
          themselves if it's time for a change.”<br />
          —Jenny Uechi, managing editor, <i>The Vancouver Observer</i><br />
