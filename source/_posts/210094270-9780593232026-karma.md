            >A new perspective on the overused and misunderstood concept of
            “karma” that offers the key to happiness and enlightenment, from
            the&nbsp;world-renowned spiritual master Sadhguru.</b
          ><br /><br />What is karma? Most people understand karma as a balance
          sheet of good and bad deeds, virtues and sins. The mechanism that
          decrees that we cannot evade the consequences of our own actions. In
          reality, karma has nothing to do with reward and punishment. Karma
          simply means action: your action, your responsibility. It isn’t some
          external system of crime and punishment, but an internal cycle
          generated by you. Accumulation of karma is determined only by your
          intention and the way you respond to what is happening to you. Over
          time, it’s possible to become ensnared by your own unconscious
          patterns of behavior.<br /><br />In <i>Karma</i>, Sadhguru seeks to
          put you back in the driver’s seat, turning you from a terror-struck
          passenger to a confident driver navigating the course of your own
          destiny. By living consciously and fully inhabiting each moment, you
          can free yourself from the cycle. <i>Karma</i> is an exploration and a
          manual, restoring our understanding of karma to its original potential
          for freedom and empowerment instead of a source of entanglement.
          Through Sadhguru’s teachings, you will learn how to live intelligently
          and joyfully in a challenging world.

          “With&nbsp;<i>Karma</i>, Sadhguru explores&nbsp;both the limitations
          and possibilities of human existence.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;full of valuable
          insights to guide&nbsp;you to live a life of fulfillment and
          well-being.”<b>—Will Smith</b><br /><br />“<i>Karma</i>&nbsp;is a
          thoughtful and life-affirming reminder of our vast capacity to effect
          positive change in our own life and in the lives of others. A
          must-read for anyone feeling stuck and hopeless.”<b>—Tony Robbins</b
          ><br /><br />“Forget what you think you know about karma—Sadhguru
          shows us it’s not a punishment for bad behavior, but a vehicle for
          transformation and empowerment. This book will put you back in charge
          of your own life.”<b>—Tom Brady<br /></b><br />“Pursuing your truth.
          Understanding this human experience. Embodying the divine is such an
          ongoing process of unveiling, adapting, and redesigning. The words in
          this book are the key to unlocking your truth, to see with no eyes, to
          hear the truth that lies in silence, and to connect with your inner
          wisdom. Thank you, Sadhguru, for such an enlightening creation, an
          offering to all seekers.”<b

          ><br />“At last, a book about karma that can be trusted.&nbsp;I have
          never found a book that explains—and solves—the mystery of karma with
          the simplicity, clarity, and hopefulness of this invaluable book.”<b
            >—Deepak Chopra</b
          ><br /><br />“Sadhguru here offers an easy read on a difficult
          subject: karma, or the volition to perform action. A truly captivating
          view from a renowned yogi and mystic on free will and the destiny of
          the human mind.”<b
            >—Prof. Dr. Steven Laureys, neurologist, University Hospital of
            Liège, Belgium<br /></b
          ><br />“The tools Sadhguru provides in&nbsp;<i>Karma</i>&nbsp;bring me
          to a place of peace within myself. Thank you for your wisdom and
          transformational guidance.”<b><b>—Rosanna Arquette</b><br /><br /></b
          >“In <i>Karma</i>, Sadhguru brilliantly demystifies the concept of
          karma and how we can harness our perceptions to change our own futures
          and, in doing so, create a more sustainable, just, and spiritually
          enlightened world. If you want to be the change you want to see in the
          world, read <i>Karma</i> and begin the journey.”<b
