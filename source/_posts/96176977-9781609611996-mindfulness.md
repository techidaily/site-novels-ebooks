            >The life-changing international bestseller&nbsp;reveals a set of
            simple yet powerful mindfulness practices that you can incorporate
            into daily life to help break the cycle of anxiety, stress,
            unhappiness, and exhaustion. </b
          ><br /><br />Mindfulness promotes the kind of happiness and peace that
          gets into your bones. It seeps into everything you do and helps you
          meet the worst that life throws at you with new courage.<br /><br />Based
          on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), the book revolves
          around a straightforward form of mindfulness meditation which takes
          just a few minutes a day for the full benefits to be revealed. MBCT
          has been clinically proven to be at least as effective as drugs for
          depression and is widely recommended by US physicians and the UK's
          National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence—in other words,
          it works. More importantly it also works for people who are not
          depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the constant demands
          of the modern world.<br /><br />MBCT was developed by the book's
          author, Oxford professor Mark Williams, and his colleagues at the
          Universities of Cambridge and Toronto. By investing just 10 to 20
          minutes each day, you can learn the simple mindfulness meditations at
          the heart of MBCT and fully reap their benefits. The book includes
          links to audio meditations to help guide you through the process.
          You'll be surprised by how quickly these techniques will have you
          enjoying life again.
