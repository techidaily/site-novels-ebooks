            It happened in an instant but the feeling lasted more than an hour.
            Wave after wave of glowing, humming energy coursed through me. I
            remember crying...or was it laughing? No, it was cry-laughing.
            Luckily, I was lying down because otherwise I would have collapsed.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            It was like pure love and pure energy had been injected into my
            veins and was flooding every atom of my body. My eyes were closed,
            and I had a blackout-mask on, but I needed to squint because the
            white-hot light that shone behind my closed eyes was as bright as
            the noonday sun.I had been on a personal journey for a few years,
            looking for answers to something that I knew was there, but was just
            out of reach. The funny thing is, this was not the destination I had
            expected or even knew I was looking for. I think that was why I was
            laughing. The crying? That was because I had never felt more
            complete, more whole, or more 'at home' at any other time in my
            life. This was the moment that I met my higher-self for the very
            first time.

            Radical Enlightenment: My Guy on the 9th Floor is a practical,
            step-by-step user's guide on how to free yourself from the prison of
            our 3-dimensional world, expand into new dimensions of
            consciousness, and 'hack' inner-peace to never again suffer a bad
            day. Interspersed with stories of my own experiences, this manual is
            a handbook and reference guide for thriving in our entangled,
            energetic, and interconnected world. A world we are all part of and
            intrinsically connected to, but a world that is just beyond our
            3-dimensional perceptions.

            Built on a foundation of ancient wisdom, as well as contemporary
            21st-century science, Radical Enlightenment: My Guy on the 9th Floor
            provides end-to-end insights, actions, ideas, and practices that
            anyone can employ on their own journey of expansion towards
            mastering their own energy, thriving in our messy, beautiful,
            tragic, and wonderful world, and connecting to their own personal
            interpretation of higher-self (Source, Spirit, God... whatever the
            label is for you). Take what you need, leave what you don't.

        <p>The last 45 minutes is something I'll listen to many times.</p>
        <p><br /></p>

          I've been receiving guidance from my higher self through daily/ weekly
          meditation for more than 10 years and this book was still tremendously
          useful. For the past couple years my guidance has been doubling down
          on letting go of my lower-self, that it's no longer needed. It says
          its time to experience the triggers, unwind them, set them down and to
          not pick them up again.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          It's taken time for me to know that this is in fact very important,
          not a mere suggestion, to believe it's possible &amp; that I'm
          deserving of such grace.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          By the end of this book I realized it to be a gift which arrived right
          on time. THIS IS HOW I UNWIND THE TRIGGERS.
        </p>

          The resources of Psych-K and the Emotions Code &amp; Body Code will
          also prove helpful, as the author ensures. But first will be the
          instructions in the last half hour or more of this audio.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          It's a beautiful work. Even if you feel like the 1st three quarters
          were written for a newby, stick with it to the end.
        </p>

          His will not be your experience. Agreed. No two are identical. But the
          tools that will bring us to the other side of life are very similar.
          The otherside being the place where we are not ruled by way of
          avoidance, denial nor fixation upon that which triggers us and
          distracts us from our knowing.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          On the other side, my guides say, there is much work to do. Hahaha!
          But it says from this new place the work is made easy.
