          <b>To see peace in our lifetimes, we have to practice love.</b
          ><br /><br />This is the radical message of this inspirational book of
          pithy advice from environmental activist Satish Kumar, which helps us
          find ways to love ourselves, others, and all beings on planet
          Earth—even those we may find unlovable.<br /><br />Satish Kumar is
          well known for his epic walk&nbsp;for world peace&nbsp;in his youth in
          the 1960s from India to the nuclear capitals of Moscow, Paris, London,
          and Washington, DC. Wherever he traveled, he found that human beings
          were capable of a love that could overcome hatred and
          division.&nbsp;Settling down in the UK, he married his wife, June
          Mitchell, and founded eco-university Schumacher College in
          Devon,&nbsp;eventually becoming a leading figure in the UK green
          movement.<br /><br /><i>Radical Love </i>distills the author's
          lifetime of experience as a lover, parent, activist, and educator into
          simple lessons on transforming our time of ecological crisis,
          conflict, and scarcity into one in which we experience harmony with
          nature, safety, and abundance. It is an exploration of the
          transformative power of love in all its forms, from romantic love to
          love for one's family and community to love for the planet and all
          beings.&nbsp;<br /><br />Kumar's approach is founded on simplicity
          (including the Jain principle of <i>aparigraha</i>), generosity, and
          continuous learning. Like an unfolding <i>metta</i> meditation, the
          book expands our notions of love to its most sublime universal state
          and makes a great gift to share with those we love.

          lasting changes in ideals, translated into practical action based on

        <p>
          <b>Satish Kumar</b>, peace-pilgrim, life-long activist, and former
          monk, has been inspiring global change for over 50 years. Aged 9,
          Satish renounced the world and became a wandering Jain monk. Then in
          his 20s, he undertook a pilgrimage for peace, walking for two years
          without money from India to&nbsp;America for the cause of nuclear
          disarmament. Now in his 80s, Satish has devoted his life
          to&nbsp;campaigning for ecological regeneration, social justice, and
          spiritual fulfilment.&nbsp;In 2022 he received the Goi Peace Award.<br /><br />A
          world-renown author and international speaker, Satish founded The
          Resurgence Trust, an educational charity that seeks to inform and
          inspire a just future for all. He was the Editor of the charity’s
          change-making magazine, Resurgence &amp; Ecologist, for over 40 years,
          making him the UK's longest-serving editor of the same magazine. He
          continues to serve this publication as Editor Emeritus and by writing
          for each and every trailblazing issue.
