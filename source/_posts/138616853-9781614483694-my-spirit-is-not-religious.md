          Millions of people today experience guilt, shame, anger, anxiety,
          depression, or similarly disempowering emotions as a result of their
          indoctrination into organized religion. More individuals are leaving
          the faith they were born into and identifying themselves as spiritual
          rather than religious.&nbsp;<i

            Life</i
          >, will help you eliminate emotional obstacles while providing

          from personal experiences—Tina Sacchi’s as well as those of her many
          clients and students. The intention is not to dismiss all organized
          religions, but to guide those for whom they no longer work and laying
          the groundwork for overcoming guilt, shame, loneliness, blame,
          anxiety, sadness, disappointment, and confusion. Whether you have a
          background in religion or not, this book will guide you to living YOUR
