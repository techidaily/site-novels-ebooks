              ><i>The Power of Guided Meditation</i>&nbsp;provides an accessible
              and easy entry point into starting a meditation practice, offering
              a range of practices and benefits so you can decide how to choose
              and integrate a program to suit your specific needs.</b
            ><br /><br />
            First, explore meditation from the perspective of mindfulness. Why
            Mindfulness? Mindfulness is the practice of bringing the attention
            back to the present moment. Mindfulness&nbsp;is not only meditation
            and meditation is not only mindfulness. Mindfulness in its most
            complete sense, is a way of&nbsp;living, thinking, and being that is
            self-aware and deliberate. Most practices as we know them in the
            West are rooted in mindfulness. <b>Discover mindfulness through:</b>
          </p>
          Body&nbsp;BreathThoughts&nbsp;Sounds&nbsp;Walking&nbsp;EatingListening/Communication&nbsp;Compassion/Kindness
          <p>
            Another focus of meditation is&nbsp;to relieve stress. Why stress
            relief? Particular meditation techniques induce a calm, serene state
            very quickly by activating the&nbsp;parasympathetic nervous
            system.&nbsp;These practices have the power to lower the heart
            rate,&nbsp;reduce inflammation in the body, settle the emotions,
            deepen the qualities of our sleep, boost the immune system,&nbsp;and
            much more.<b> Relieve stress with:</b>
          </p>
          Yoga nidraBreathing exercises—calm breathing, diaphragmatic breath,
          square breathingProgressive muscle relaxationSleepAffirmation
          <p>
            Or, use visualization techniques to anchor a practice. Why
            Visualization? Visualization lets our mind remain somewhat active as
            it takes instruction to create images&nbsp;internally. The mind-body
            connection is powerful and we’re learning more about it everyday.
            Visualization techniques&nbsp;have been successfully used in the
            fields of medicine, sports, music, and psychology for many years.
            <b>Practice visualization through:</b>

            There is also a useful and
            <b
              >complete directory to reference if you have a specific issue
              you’d like to address or a desired meditative effect</b
            >—like more energy,&nbsp;clarity, pain relief—that you’d like to
            achieve. Depending on your goal, it will direct you to a guided
            meditation in&nbsp;the book, or it will give you a new exercise for
            your particular focus. You can search through&nbsp;some common
            physical conditions that are often helped with meditation, or you
            can choose an activity from the&nbsp;“Quick Re-sets.”<br /><br />

            versatile beginner's guide.
