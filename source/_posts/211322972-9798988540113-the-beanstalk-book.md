              beloved husband in spirit that ignites her imagination, urging her

          experiences of pain, grief, trauma, heartbreak and even death, and
          show you how to bring your dearest dreams to life no matter what your

          Kim, as I read your book, I cannot help but cry when you speak to me
          as if I am seeing and hearing my own thoughts. With each page, I find
          commonalities not only you and I share but that most women share when
          losing their love, their soul mate, their everything. Your writing and
          imagery are exceptional: the "magical beanstalks" encourage thinking
          through situations and decisions, deciphering possibilities not
          imagined when learning to cope with and some day "enjoy alone".

          The time I spend "Beanstalking'"has allowed for both reflection and
          projection. I have been able to creatively set a course for my journey
          into the next chapter of my life. Through Kim's beautiful and
          imaginative creation, The Beanstalk Book, and with her guidance, I am
          feeling a sense of joy and peacefulness that is new and so very
          welcome. Kim's bravery in sharing her own painful journey and her
          willingness to let us join her as she manifests the life she's dreamed
          of, has been invaluable in allowing me to believe in myself again. Kim

          provides a road map for hope, freedom, possibility and a joyful life.
          And, on top of all that, "Beanstalking" is just a whole lotta fun!!"

        <p>Reader Review</p>
        <p>
          Kim helped me to follow my heart and open my own business. Thank you,
          times a million! She made my dreams that seemed BIG and unrealistic,
          on level and achievable. She moved clouds and paved a way toward
          sunshine.

        <p>Reader Review</p>
        <p>
          Kim's book is a bit whimsical and carefree but tackles tough emotions
          and real life situations. Her methods for growing and improving are
          simple and straightforward. She approaches others with kindness, love
          and tenderness and is always encouraging. She is sensitive and funny
          and she just sort of sparkles.
