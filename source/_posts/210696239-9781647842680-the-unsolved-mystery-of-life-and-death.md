          <p>
            Nowadays, you and I are in the midst of AI, big data, multimedia,
            gossip, rumors, materialistic desires, and the great trend of the
            times.In the midst of the confusion and material satisfaction caused
            by complicated and novel things, have you ever thought about
            examining life with a reflective attitude and taking a careful and
            quiet look at life, the apparent convenience and innovation of
            technological civilization, but deepening the hidden nature of life
            that is hard to erase and sad and miserable at the bottom of our
            habitual thinking?
          </p>
          <p>
            If human life is like a special, unusual, significant and
            far-reaching key, every morning when you wake up to take it, you
            have to fill out the application form carefully and seriously,
            without being meticulous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before going to sleep at night, thank God for today's gift and
            return the key to life with gratitude.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we have used the key of life thousands of times, over and over
            again, then why do we have to do as Sisyphus did, with great effort,
            to push a boulder up a mountain?
          </p>
          <p>
            After pushing a boulder up to the top of the mountain, we let it
            roll back down again, and so on, day after day, applying and
            repeating forever. ......
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine when we return the key to life, do we take an introspective
            attitude and examine our life deeply: what have we achieved today?
            What have we failed?
          </p>
          <p>
            So one cannot help but ask: which direction should we choose for the
            existence of the universe and life itself, and what lifestyle should
            we adopt?
          </p>
          <p>
            What is the value of the existence of life itself, and what is the
            true meaning of the existence of life itself?
          </p>
          <p>
            What if the days of our existence in the universe, in life itself,
            always begin under such hard-won circumstances?
          </p>
          <p>
            If our cosmic life existence, our existence itself, has always
            started in such a hard way and ended in such a sad way, then we must
            have a deeper self-awareness and reflection on our cosmic life
            existence, our existence itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the question of life and death will again become a sharp
            and sensitive issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Eastern and Western philosophies of life have, for ages,
            attempted to unravel the mystery of life and death in the existence
            of everything in the universe itself, in order to understand the
            true meaning of the existence of the world around us.
          </p>
          <p>
            They attribute life to the simple "existence" that distinguishes
            between animals and inanimate things, and to the "mind" that is
            uniquely human.
          </p>
          <p>
            It even goes on to use the phenomena that differentiate everything
            from one generation to another and the various theories that explain
            these phenomena, in order to decipher the existence of life in the
            universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            To decipher the knowledge and culture inherent in the existence of
            life in the universe. It serves the purpose of the existence and
            evolution of a certain kind of being itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, "mind" is a sum of the ability to realize the motive by the
            biological reaction of people through the precipitation and storage
            of known things.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the sum of all the thinking abilities to feel, observe,
            understand, judge, choose, remember, imagine, hypothesize, and
            reason, and then to guide their behavior according to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, 'mind' covers the 'philosophical' level: the accumulation and
            storage of the known (subconscious); combined with the 'biological'
            (consciousness) level of brain information processing, that is,
            'physiological response'.
          </p>
          <p>
            The "mental" activity that engages in the conscious effort to
            achieve a certain ideal or purpose, thus consciously defining the
            purpose, is applied to the mental state.
