              ><i>Spirituality &amp; Practice "</i>Best Books of 2021" Award
              Winner<br /><br />A highly practical and approachable guide to
              somatic meditation with easy practices for accessing the body's
              inherent mindfulness, from an expert in somatic meditation.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />Tap into the wisdom of the body with down-to-earth
          practices like "Surrendering to the Breath" and "Befriending Feelings"
          that allow the body to become the source of mindfulness.&nbsp;Willa
          Blythe Baker&nbsp;introduces meditation practice as the cultivation of
          a way of being, rather than a way of doing. It is a way of being that
          is self-aware, self-compassionate, and embodied. This way of being is
          not limited to practice on the cushion or on the yoga mat--somatic
          mindfulness is available at any moment, activated by attention to the
          body's wisdom and its teachings.<br /><br />Discover the three layers
          of embodiment, from the earth body of flesh and blood, the subtle body
          of sensory experience and emotion, and the awareness body of
          consciousness. The three parts of this book explore these layers
          through turning attention to the physical, energetic, and mental
          dimensions of human experience. By diving deep into the body, readers
          will find that they already have what they need. Concentration,
          wisdom, compassion, kindness, and joy are waiting there.

        <p>
          “This remarkable book brings the body into clear focus as a medium of
          awakening.”—Roshi Joan Halifax, abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>The Wakeful Body</i> is a wisdom treasure bringing forth the
          insights, life stories, hidden teachings, and practice
          pathways&nbsp;on how to tend the ‘agriculture of the soul,’ including
          knots, entanglements, and uprooting embodied suffering toward
          liberation and integration.&nbsp;Lama Willa’s experience and
          collection of teachings on the power of flow, dance,&nbsp;and movement
          practices in Tibetan Buddhist traditions is a rare
          treasure&nbsp;offered by a pioneering teacher with great benefit to
          all. Emaho! A classic is born for future generations.”—Shiva Rea,
          founder of Samudra Global School of Living Yoga and author of
          <i>Tending the Heart Fire</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In a most refreshing way, Lama Willa invites us to wake up to the
          wisdom of our bodies. Her skillful and practical guidance, informed by
          years of deep practice in yoga and Tibetan Buddhist meditation,
          literally moves us in new ways to be embodied and get out of our
          heads. <i>The Wakeful Body </i>is a treasure of a book filled with
          countless gems to nourish and ground. It will be a trusted resource
          for years to come that I will return to time and time again.”—Susan
          Bauer-Wu, PhD, RN, president of the Mind &amp; Life Institute and
          author of <i>Leaves Falling Gently</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>The Wakeful Body</i> is a gift to the world and cements
          Willa&nbsp;Blythe&nbsp;Baker as one of our strongest and most
          convincing voices of a deeply somatic approach to Buddhist
          practice.&nbsp;Baker persuasively theorizes that meditation is
          misconceived as something we do with our mind.&nbsp;Far more
          profitable is an exploration of bodily experience, and this shift in
          focus from mind to body changes everything for the aspiring
          meditator.&nbsp;Filled with anecdotes from her life, we follow her
          journey of awakening as she enters as a young novitiate on the path
          and emerges as one of the most important teachers of our time.”—Will
          Johnson, author of <i>The Posture of Meditation</i> and
          <i>Breathing through the Whole Body</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The human body is a sacred form full of potential. This book lays out
          rich and practical guidance to utilize it as a doorway to healing and
          spiritual awakening.”—Anam Thubten, author of
          <i>Choosing Compassion</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “A beautifully written expression of devotion to the body as
          teacher—wherein one can clearly feel the depth and authenticity of the
          author’s exploration and practice.”—Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel, author
          of <i>The Logic of Faith</i>
