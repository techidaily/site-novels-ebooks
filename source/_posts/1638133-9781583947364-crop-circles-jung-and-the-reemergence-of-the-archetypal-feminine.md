          Throwing light on the mysterious phenomenon of crop circles within the
          context of modern psychological reality<i
            >, Crop Circles, Jung, and the Reemergence of the Archetypal
            Feminine</i
          >
          in an engaging look at the science, history, and symbolic nature of
          the mystery of these annually occurring giant-scale works of art. Gary
          S. Bobroff offers a framework for the reader's own deeper
          consideration of crop circles by examining both the phenomenon itself
          and the nature of the era into which it has arrived, with special
          consideration of its relevance to Jungian archetypal psychology.<br /><br />Living
          in the moment of the death of one worldview and the birth of another,
          our culture suffers from a hyper-masculine inflation that has us
          alienated, imagining ourselves to be separate from each other and the
          earth. Today we are presented with environmental, social, and
          spiritual crises and mysteries that call us back toward closer
          participation with the world. Crop Circles--formed in living
          grain--exemplify the archetypal feminine nature of this moment's
          change: a calling toward conscious, felt engagement with a dynamic,
          living, mysterious world. Placing this modern "dream" into the context
          of modern reality,
          <i
            >Crop Circles, Jung, and the Reemergence of the Archetypal
            Feminine</i
          >
          considers what it means to live in an era of strange encounters with
          energies larger than ourselves.<br /><br /><b>Contents</b

          “This is a rare and gifted man who will be one of the authentic
          teachers of his generation.… Gary Bobroff is a stunning
          writer—graceful, eloquent, subtle—and the skill with which he weaves
          together his fascination with Crop Circles, the return of the Divine
          Feminine in our time, and Jungian psychology in what is a kind of
          ‘spiritual mystery’ exhilarates me.… This is an original masterpiece
          of a book. Savor it richly, slowly, and gratefully, and many
          interlinked secrets will be revealed to you, and in you.”—from the
          foreword by <b>Andrew Harvey</b>, founder of the Institute for Sacred
          Activism<br /><br />
          “By invoking the perspectives of the great psychologist C. G. Jung,
          Gary Bobroff provides penetrating insights into one of the most
          puzzling phenomena of our time.”—<b>Larry Dossey, MD</b>, author of
          <i>One Mind<br /></i><br />
          “<i
            >Crop Circles, Jung, and the Reemergence of the Archetypal
            Feminine</i
          >
          is one of the most original and valid approaches to the crop circles
          that I have read for a long time, and the author is to be
          congratulated for opening the subject out to a new area of
          investigation! Bobroff's appearance at the renowned Glastonbury
          Symposium conference to discuss the themes of the book was very well
          received and inspired many people to take a fresh look at an old but
          continuing mystery, opening the doors to important and deeper layers
          of understanding.”—<b>Andy Thomas</b>, author of
          <i>Vital Signs, The Truth Agenda, </i>and <i>Conspiracies<br /></i
          ><br />
          “Unflinchingly intelligent! Vital and important, original, insightful,
          and resonant with hope. [The author] fearlessly acknowledges the deep
          mystery inherent in the Crop Circle phenomenon and gently offers a way
          for people to absorb, accept, and understand.”—<b>Laura Ferguson</b>,
          director of the&nbsp;College of the Melissae<br /><br />
          “I learned more from&nbsp;Gary Bobroff&nbsp;about masculine and
          feminine archetypal energies and how they manifest in the world than
          from any other book in my substantial Jungian library. His approach is
          neither a return to the Goddess nor a repeal of the Warrior but a
          siren call to balance both ‘intelligences’ for the salvation of our
          planet.”—<b>Diane Croft</b>, author of&nbsp;<i
            >The Unseen Partner<br /></i
          ><br />
          “A tremendous achievement! Clear, lucid, and comprehensive!”—<b
            >Anne Baring</b
          >, author of <i>The Dream of the Cosmos </i>and<i
            >&nbsp;The Myth of the Goddess<br /></i
          ><br />"Both psychologically grounded and open to the inspiring awe of
          this new wonder, Bobroff's approach is one that is accessible to
          everyone, and no prior exposure to Jung or crop circles is
          required"—<b>K. D. Farris</b>, author of<i>
