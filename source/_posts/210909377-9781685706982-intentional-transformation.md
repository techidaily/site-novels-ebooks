            In his first study book, Nathaniel Jones delves into the principles,
            strategies, and challenges of studying, meditating, and applying the
            Word of God to our everyday lives. It is in these consistent,
            sincere, and often imperfect efforts that we will develop a deeper
            relationship with our loving Heavenly Father. In this
            soul-transforming work, Nathaniel builds upon God's foundational
            principle of love. It is love that captivates and motivates us such
            that we yearn for it and it only. It was this epiphany, despite
            years of being a pastor, church leader, husband, father, and son,
            that he began to grasp and embrace what he felt had been
            underemphasized in his ministry. With a renewed enthusiasm for the
            transformational work he was witnessing in his own life, he began
            sharing these enlightenments with others.

            This study is to inspire a personal relationship with God. It is not
            to support our religious beliefs or denominational doctrine but to
            help us learn, know, and live the truth and walk in love. Part of
            our conundrum is having a relationship with someone with whom we
            have no conventional physical connection. A personal relationship
            with God requires surrendering to the Spirit of God and
            intentionally studying His Word while also being transparent,
            reverentially relaxed, and open with Him. He knows everything yet
            wants a loving--not merely transactional--relationship with us. He
            wants to hear our voices, and He wants us to know His will. It is in
            these times that we can share our thoughts, stories, traumas, etc.
            with the One Who gets us--for with Him--we are always
            safe--emotionally and otherwise.

            It is in our relationship with Him that we begin to truly know who
            we are as His children, the seed of Abraham through Jesus Christ. In
            this way, we become the people God created us to be and live the
            successful, joyful, and peaceful lives we truly want and that He
            intends for us to live.
