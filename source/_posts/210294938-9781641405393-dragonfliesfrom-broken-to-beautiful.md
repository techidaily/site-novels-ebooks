            You might wonder how an average girl, living a normal life, could
            find herself in the pits of addiction. I wondered that very thing.
            How could I have ever allowed myself to be controlled by a pain
            pill? So I decided to trace my steps, and find out exactly where I
            went so wrong; that's how this book came into existence. My story
            was written entirely by me. It's an honest account of my journey
            from being broken to becoming a far more beautiful version of
            myself. When I say beautiful, I'm not referring to physical beauty;
            I am referring to my soul, my spirit, and the essence of who I am.
            There is much that I am ashamed of, and sincerely wish I could undo.
            However, I have realized that I cannot change the past; I can only
            learn from it and make the present and future better than I thought
            possible. So, I choose to look at my journey as a blessing, for it's
            made me into the person that I am today, and I'm extremely proud of
            who I have become. It wasn't easy; it required a lot of hard work
            and determination, but it was worth every bit of pain that I
            endured. My sincere hope is that my story can serve as a lesson for
            others. I want my nightmare to prevent yours. And if, by chance,
            you're in the middle of your own nightmare, I want you to know that
            I am living, breathing proof that there is a happy ending waiting
            for you. Allow me to share with you what I never wanted anyone to
            know, my addiction and how I overcame it. Freedom and a bright
            future are waiting for you. Let me help you get there.
