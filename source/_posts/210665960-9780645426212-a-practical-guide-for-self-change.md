              difficult. All you need is a system that works for YOU.</strong

          <p>
            It doesn't matter whether you know exactly what you want to change,
            or not. If you have a vision of yourself having a better life than
            where you are right now, then know your life can be better if you
            apply what you learn in this book. A Practical Guide for Self Change
            provides a blueprint for changing your life in a simple and easy to
            read format.

          <p>
            What it takes to plan and action self change is a bit of focus. We
            know that what we focus on we pay more attention to. You are already
            doing this right now. However, it may well be that what you are
            focussing on is the lack of progress, or negative emotions you are
            current6ly experiencing. If you flip this and start focussing on the
            things you can change - you and your perceptions - then you will
            start to see the positive effects on your life.
          </p>
          <p>In this book, you will discover:</p>
          The real reasons you are considering changeHow small changes can make
          huge shiftsWhy change doesn't have to be hardThe barriers that could
          be holding you back from making changesWhy your unconscious mind
          resists change and how to overcome this
          <p>
            Diana Hutchison has a background in psychology. After experiencing
            burnout, she transformed her life and followed her passion for
            self-development by becoming proficient in a number of modalities
            including NLP (Neurolinguistic Programming), coaching and
            counselling.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Through finding out what works for herself and her clients she
            inspires others to explore and discover how to create positive
            change.

            A Practical Guide for Self Change teaches you how to look at change,
            particularly self change, what steps are involved and how to go
            about implementing change. You will essentially be creating your own
            self-change management program that, when actioned, will start your
            self-transformation. The process includes exploring what you set as
            your goals for self-change all along the pathway before, during and
            after your plans are actioned. Possibilities for troubleshooting are
            outlined to enable you to overcome any roadblocks on the path to
            your future-self destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book can be the shift to start your journey to freedom and into
            a life you've always dreamed of.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            If you desperately want to change yourself and your life, but feel
            you are stuck, or have hit a road block on the road to freeing
            yourself of habits and issues that are holding you back from living
            your best life, then this book is for you. It isn't about willpower
            in changing yourself. It is about having a flexible but powerful
            self change transformation program that you yourself create as you
            go step by step.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you engage in the exercises and transformation tools explored
            within. If you are curious about self-development or changing your
            approach to yourself, whether you are just beginning your journey or
            began long ago, you will still find this book of value. You may for
            instance often seek to please others, and have a habit of always
            putting yourself last, or even finding yourself unable to accept
            compliments with a "Thank you" and feel you don't deserve them. This
            is an indication that you may have low self-esteem, and feel you are
            not good enough. In this book you will learn how to at least make a
            start to improving your self-esteem.

            Diana's life-long passion for self-development has led her to a
            holistic approach that explores all levels of being: physical,
            mental, emotional and spiritual, and to a perspective of
            self-healing which enables the best results for her clients. This
            multiple perspective has inspired the authorship of
            <strong>The Practical Guide Series</strong> of which this book is
            the first.
