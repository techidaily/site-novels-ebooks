          <i>Gracious Wild&nbsp;</i>is the story of Stacey Couch’s incredible
          journey out of the mundane world of science and reason into the vast
          shamanic realms of creativity and inspiration. Readers will travel on
          this intimate exploration of what happens when one woman allows the
          messengers of nature to guide her. These winged guides wrap her mind
          up in the mysteries they present, leading her to a richer, more
          fulfilling life.<br /><br />Stacey’s tale begins on an isolated island
          where, as a scientist, her main responsibility is to care for a couple
          dozen foxes in captivity. &nbsp;As a result of a series of ecological
          tragedies, the fox population is on the verge of extinction and a
          novel hawk species begins nesting on the island for the first time in
          recorded history. It is during her time watching the nesting hawks
          alone in nature that her real quest begins–a series of hawks become
          her guides; rousing life’s biggest questions like “why am I here?”
          &nbsp;<br /><br /><i>Gracious Wild</i>&nbsp;weaves Stacey’s
          relationship with the hawks alongside her study of shamanism with a
          good deal of information included for those seeking more details about
          this spiritual path. &nbsp;<br /><br />Stacey’s belief is, “that wild
          animals are trying to speak and interact with us every day. To listen
          to them is to listen to that which is divine within each of us. Their
          calls mirror our own inner calling to a greater purpose.”&nbsp;<br /><br /><i
            >Gracious Wild</i
          >&nbsp;offers a vivid and candid tale of a woman who loses then
          rewrites the meaning of her life at the same time showing readers
          their own humanity; how being open to spirit messages from animals can
          provide important and beneficial (life-changing) guidance.

          "Stacey shares the doors to her wild self in her book in an authentic
          manner. This is not a guidebook to shamanism, though she does provide
          a brief introduction and helpful resources. Instead,
          <i>Gracious Wild </i>is a woman’s story of her spiritual journey. Her
          story is an inspiration for those of us looking to connect to our wild
          selves as well. It is told with love and honesty. I can see women
          coming together to read Stacey’s book, discussing all the doors it
          opens for exploration. I can see how once you have read her book you
          won’t see the wild animals around you in the same way." -<b
