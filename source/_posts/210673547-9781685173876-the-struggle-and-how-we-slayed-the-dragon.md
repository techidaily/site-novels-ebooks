            From being successful business owners to going three years without
            income, losing significant clients, incurring major layoffs,
            betrayal, and exhausting personal finances, our story is meant to
            inspire small business owners, entrepreneurs, and those thinking of
            starting a business that the power of faith, trust, and perseverance
            can triumph all adversaries.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            As my wife and I look over the past twenty years that we have been
            in business, we are so grateful and humble for the love and support
            God has given to us. We are also grateful for God's strength during
            the most adverse times in our lives where the many setbacks and
            tribulations we've encountered almost wiped us out completely. We
            were one bad decision away from losing it all. However, through
            God's grace and mercy, he kept us in his righteous right hand the
            whole time.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            This book was written to be as transparent as possible in exposing
            to our readers the difficulties my wife and I encountered and
            endured as business owners.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Expressing our emotional, financial, physical, and creatively
            fatigued stress and how we overcame each and every one of them is
            the sole purpose of this book! There aren't any business textbook
            principals discussed in this book, but there are many examples of
            how God changed our situations from bad to good. Whether you are
            single or married, in a business, there is always some significant
            other, wife, husband, or family member that is affected the same way
            as you are. So we decided, before we started writing this book, that
            we would give our individual perspectives so that everyone could
            actually relate and understand that whatever they are thinking
            during difficult times, they are not alone.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Despite me and my wife's sixteen-year age difference, opposite
            personalities, different faiths, and being raised in different
            countries, we were able, through God's love and strength, to conquer
            our differences, doubts, and fears with confidence in knowing that
            if we stay grounded in the Word and patiently hold firm to our hope
            in God and consistently stay in prayer, he would give us the power
            to slay the dragon, and he certainly did!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>God bless each and every one of you!</p>
