            how to best share them with the world.”—MILA KUNIS</b
          ><br /><br />There are four elements—fire, earth, air, and water—that
          exist in nature and within us all. Knowing your personal map of these
          four elements offers a way to personalize your self-care rituals and
          design your best life: one that fully expresses your special gifts.<br /><br />With
          a PhD in psychology in addition to her expertise as an astrologer, Dr.
          Jennifer Freed is here&nbsp;to show you to how to decode and tap into
          your gifts in this practical guide to life. She explains how your
          astrological birth chart can point you to the life you want and offers
          self-assessments to pinpoint your most effective strategies.
          <i>A Map to Your Soul </i>offers practical exercises for topics
          ranging from communication styles to creativity, home styles to
          psychic development, health habits to belief systems. Some of the
          advice is as simple as the color scheme that will make you feel most
          at peace in your bedroom. Other advice is as nuanced as how to better
          listen to your loved ones and how to fulfill your soul’s purpose.<br /><br />To
          get a sense of how the four elements manifest for you, think of a time
          when you felt:&nbsp;<br /><br />•<i> Mentally clear</i>: that's
          <b>air<br /></b>•<i> Grounded and centered</i>: that's
          <b>earth<br /></b>•<i> Flowing and feeling:</i> that's
          <b>water<br /></b>•<i> Creative and Dynamic</i>: that's
          <b>fire<br /></b><br />Written with the beginner in mind but offering
          insight to the experienced student of astrology,
          <i>A Map to Your Soul</i> is a 12-part journey through the way the
          elements express themselves in your life. By balancing and supporting
          the elements within us, we can finally truly flourish.
