          We know from countless spirituality and self-help books that authentic
          joy has no object—it is truly free and boundless. And yet, try as we
          might, how many of us can say that joy is more than a fleeting
          fleeting?<br /><br />Daniel Odier’s approach, which is based in part
          on his study of Chinese Zen, is refreshingly straightforward. All it
          requires is a willingness to disengage from our habitual ways of
          thinking and practice being present throughout the day. He calls his
          method, “The Practice of Consciousness.” Its purpose is to unlock our
          spontaneity and recover our innocence and creativity. He writes,<br /><br />“Consciousness
          manifests itself as presence. To work with presence is similar to
          learning a musical instrument, the body being our instrument. To enter
          this state, take a sensation such as water flowing into your hand or
          the feel of your bare feet on the ground. Enter deeply into the
          contact; breathe by relaxing your abdomen; and after fifteen or twenty
          seconds, leave the sensation and return to your habitual mode. Doing
          this thirty, forty or fifty times a day allows us to enter into a deep
          acquaintance with sensation.”<br /><br />With a nod to Aldous Huxley,
          whose book <i>Doors of Perception</i> laid the groundwork for the
          psychedelic and sexual revolutions, Odier’s aim is nothing short of
          total human liberation. Still, he is realistic about the power that
          habit and our ingrained ways of operating in the world has over us. To
          counter them, he offers up some mischievous advice--like this,<br /><br />“There
          is something suspect about our adoration of harmony. One of the things
          I fantasize about is replacing the Buddha on my altar with one of
          Caesar. The harmony of the Buddha puts us to sleep and makes us soft,
          but the chaos of Caesar can wake us up. Every morning before this
          altar we would abandon harmony in favor of the infinite possibilities
          that chaos represents.”<br /><br />With <i>Doors of Joy</i>, Daniel
          Odier has discovered the trip-wire that keeps us from experiencing
          lasting joy and he gives us the tool kit that will bring it back into
          our lives for good.

          "In Odier’s (<i>Tantric Quest</i>) newest, the Zen and Tantric
          Buddhist master offers brief yet expansive meditations for breaking
          out of routines of habit and working towards living authentically with
          others and with one’s self. For Odier, people live seemingly happy
          lives of pleasant self-deception that are created out of fear of the
          unknown and love for the predictable. He shows readers the possibility
          of embracing a life of spontaneity and deep, organic joy. Each
          meditation focuses on a different aspect, touching on how readers can
          begin, for example, embracing insecurities, practicing compassion,
          dropping opinions, and being present in the moment. Questions for
          reflection on preconceptions and everyday lives follow the themes of
          the meditation. Included with these meditations are short instructions
          for deepening awareness of the breath. Odier dares readers to be
          uncomfortable and insecure in the chaos of human existence, where they
          can learn to be pliant and present rather than rigid and distracted.
          This sort of authentic living, for Odier, would allow readers to swim
          with the tides of life instead of against its crashing waves."<br />-
          <i>Publisher's Weekly </i>(December 6, 2013)<br /><br />"...[an]
          open-ended&nbsp;inquiry that shuns&nbsp;systematising&nbsp;to an
          extent. Broken down into nineteen meditations ‘for authentic living,’
          Daniel Odier&nbsp;gives short meditative essays followed up by
          practical questions that could last a lifetime of soul-searching work.
          Odier’s inspiration comes from a variety of Indian teachings, as well
          as Zen teachings from China and elsewhere."<br />-
