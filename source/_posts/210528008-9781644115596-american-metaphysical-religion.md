            >An in-depth exploration of four centuries of American occult and
            spiritual history, from colonial-era alchemists to 20th-century
            teachers</b
          ><br /><br />• Details how, from the very beginning, America was a
          vibrant blend of beliefs from all four corners of the world<br /><br />•
          Looks at well-known figures such as Manly P. Hall and offers riveting
          portraits of many lesser known esoteric luminaries such as the Pagan
          Pilgrim, Tom Morton<br /><br />• Reveals the Rosicrucians among the
          first settlers from England, the spiritual influence of enslaved
          people, the work of mystical abolitionists, and how Native Americans
          and Latinx people helped shape contemporary spirituality<br /><br />Most
          Americans believe the United States was founded by pious Christians.
          However, as Ronnie Pontiac reveals, from the very beginning America
          was a vibrant blend of beliefs from all four corners of the world.
          <br /><br />Based on the latest research, with the assistance of
          leading scholars, this in-depth exploration of four centuries of
          American occult and spiritual history looks at everything from
          colonial-era alchemists, astrologers, and early spiritual collectives
          to Edgar Cayce, the Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor, and St. Germain on
          Mount Shasta. Pontiac shows that Rosicrucians were among the first
          settlers from England and explores how young women of the Shaker
          community fell into trances and gave messages from the dead. He
          details the spiritual influence of the African diaspora, the work of
          mystical abolitionists, and how Indigenous groups and Latinx people
          played a large role in the shaping of contemporary spirituality and
          healing practices. <br /><br />The author looks at well-known figures
          such as Manly P. Hall and lesser known esoteric luminaries such as the
          Pagan Pilgrim, Tom Morton. He examines the Aquarian Gospel, the
          Sekhmet Revival, <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, the School of Ageless
          Wisdom, and mediumship in the early 20th century. He explores the
          profound influence of the Bodhi Tree Bookstore in Los Angeles and
          looks at the evolution of female roles in spirituality across the
          centuries. He also examines the right wing of American metaphysics
          from the Silver Legion to QAnon. <br /><br />Revealing the diverse
          streams that run through America’s metaphysical landscape, Pontiac
          offers an encyclopedic examination of occult teachers, esotericists,
          and spiritual collectives almost no one has heard of but who were
          profoundly influential.
