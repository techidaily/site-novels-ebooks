            NEW and INNOVATIVE - This book describes a new and innovative
            psychological system which has become known as BI/POLAR PSYCHOLOGY.
            It shows how BI/POLAR PSYCHOLOGY has evolved as the result of
            applying fundimental Judeo-Christian teachings to the solution of
            practical management problems in business and industy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a person learns this system, it becomes the key which unlocks his
            personal growth and increases his effectiveness in helping others to
            grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            PRACTICAL and USEFUL&nbsp; - The author presents his concepts in a
            direct and forceful manner using everyday language and giving
            numerous examples to illustrate his points. He avoids vague
            psychological jargon. In contrast, his powerful new ideas display
            the grandeur of simplicity which is characteristic of all truly
            great ideas. This kind of clarity and simplicity makes his approich
            easily understood and useful to people in all walks of life.
