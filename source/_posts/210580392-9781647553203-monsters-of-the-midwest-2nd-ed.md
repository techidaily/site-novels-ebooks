            A mysterious snake grows to frightening proportions. A slimy,
            clawed, green-scaled beast terrorizes swimmers from the bottom of a
            lake. Two enormous birds try to prey upon farm animals—and children.
            The Midwest’s history includes several unimaginable encounters with
            legendary creatures. This collection of “ghost stories” presents the
            creepiest, most surprising tales of monsters in the states of
            Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri,
            Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authors Jessica Freeburg and Natalie Fowler are active paranormal
            investigators with a shared fascination for things that go bump in
            the night. The professional writers spent countless hours combing
            the region for the strangest and scariest run-ins with the
            unexplained.
          </p>
          <p>

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Jessica Freeburg</b> has always been inquisitive and loves all of
          the challenges that life—and the afterlife—have to offer. As the
          founder of Ghost Stories Ink, Jessica has performed paranormal
          investigations at a variety of reportedly haunted locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has written young adult fiction, middle-grade narrative
          nonfiction, and short stories for children and adults. She has served
          as a news correspondent for the wildly popular paranormal radio show
          <i>Darkness Radio</i> and on the editorial staff of
          <i>FATE</i> magazine. She is the Assistant Regional Advisor for the
          Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators in Minnesota.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jessica also enjoys working in screenwriting and documentary
          production. She lives in Minnesota with her husband and three
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Natalie Fowler</b> has been fascinated by ghost stories since she
          was a little girl—she could never learn enough about ghosts. Once a
          practicing attorney, now Natalie does freelance editorial work and
          writes her own stories. She is a staff editor for <i>FATE</i> magazine
          and Galde Press.
        </p>
        <p>
          Natalie is a self-proclaimed research geek and could easily spend
          hours in the library with dusty old books. She is a paranormal
          investigator for Ghost Stories Ink, a group of authors and
          illustrators who go on ghost hunts for creative inspiration. She is
          always happy to fulfill any of the team’s research needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Together with Jessica Freeburg, Natalie co-edited the group’s first
          anthology, <i>Night Visions,</i> a collection of short stories
          inspired by their paranormal investigations.
