          ><br />
          Energy Speaks gives us a clear blueprint for growth and change. It
          provides practical guidance and inspiration on the things that matter
          most to us — including love, sex, money, personal power,
          self-expression and purpose, emotional healing and well-being, and how
          to have peace with our families — as well as more esoteric topics,
          such as how to invoke the help of our spirit guides and angels.<br />
          <br />
          This empowering book is the work of a great emerging spiritual
          teacher. It is filled with tools that you can use to break free of
          limitations and transform your life.

          “On a personal level, shedding the spiritual, emotional, and mental
          toxicity with Lee Harris and the Zs made me a much lighter, happier,
          more compassionate, more connected person, not to mention a far better
          wife, mother, and friend. On a professional level, it put me into the
          flow of great new opportunities and creative ideas.”<br />

          There are but two that carry a frequency that stands out among the

          following. Energy Speaks, a distillation of teachings on subjects
          ranging from abundance to sleep to sexuality, is a gentle and
          openhearted offering as Lee supports his readers in claiming a higher
          and more authentic expression of their lives.”<br />

          personal power, acts like rocket fuel for those of us who want to live
          more consciously and love more courageously. This is exactly the book
          our world needs right now — one you’ll return to many times, and one
          that will energize and inspire you with each reading.”<br />
          <strong>— Scott Stabile,</strong> author of Big Love: The Power of
          Living with a Wide-Open Heart<br />
          <br />

          who know they have been told half-truths and want to find meaning and
          depth in their lives. Energy Speaks is an answer to this need.”<br />
