              >Psychedelic experiences can be some of the most profound and
              life-changing events that happen in a person's life. They open up
              doors within the mind that can lead to deep healing and personal
              growth. The truth is that the psychedelic experience is not the
              end of the healing journey, rather it is the beginning. The
              process of integration is where the lasting change occurs. It is
              through consistent habits and routines that the lessons from the
              medicine can be implemented and lead to lasting change.
              Psychedelics were the catalyst that helped me to completely turn
              my life around and become the person that I was always meant to
              become. I learned so many lessons throughout my time sitting with
              plant medicines and doing my own research. I did not have the
              community and resources that I have now when I started on my
              journey. That is why I am so passionate about creating resources
              that I know would have been so beneficial to me when I was first
              exploring these various plant medicines. I created this book to
              serve as a general guide to the psychedelic experience. It is
              broken down into 3 main parts which are: pre-ceremony,
              during-ceremony, and post-ceremony sections. In each of the
              sections, I provide insights into the habits and practices that
              have had the biggest impact on my clients, my peers, and myself as
              I have navigated visionary experiences. Everyone's experience is
              unique and you can never know exactly what to expect, however,
              this book shines a light on what you may come across and how to be
              best prepared in your mind, body, and spirit for anything that may
              arise.</strong
