          An investigation of how Moses was deceived and murdered by his
          father-in-law, Reuel <br /><br />• Shows how the magician Reuel staged
          the Burning Bush that spoke to Moses and assumed Moses’ identity after
          his murder <br /><br />• Explains how early scribes edited the Exodus
          story to cover Moses’ assassination and replacement and fabricated
          Moses’ origin story <br /><br />• Builds upon the Moses research of
          Goethe, Christopher Marlowe, and Sigmund Freud--who spent the last 40
          years of his life obsessed with solving Moses’ murder <br /><br />The
          life of Moses, the greatest prophet of the Old Testament, has always
          been shrouded in mystery. The Bible mentions no witnesses to Moses’
          death, no funeral, and no indication of his burial place, and the
          story of Exodus paints a very contradictory picture of this man so
          important to both Judaism and Christianity. At times, he is depicted
          as a meek, stuttering figure and at others his tyrannical commands and
          fits of rage terrorize the children of Israel. And, for the last years
          of his life, he chose to hide behind a veil. What is the explanation
          for these extreme shifts in character? Was Moses mentally ill? As Rand
          and Rose Flem-Ath reveal, the evidence points to something much more
          sinister: Moses was murdered and replaced by an impostor.
          <br /><br />The result of a decade-long investigation, this book
          continues and builds upon the research of Goethe, Christopher Marlowe,
          and Sigmund Freud--who spent the last 40 years of his life obsessed
          with solving Moses’ murder--and reaches a startling but well-evidenced
          conclusion that Moses was deceived and murdered by his father-in-law,
          Reuel. The authors show how Reuel was a skilled magician trained at
          Egypt’s prestigious House of Life and they reveal his motive: He was
          the son of Esau, from whom Jacob stole his birthright, the leadership
          of the Hebrew people, a role that Moses was now assuming.
          <br /><br />The authors explain how the magician Reuel used his
          sophisticated skills of manipulation and illusion to fake the Burning
          Bush that spoke to Moses as well as conceal his assumption of Moses’
          identity after the murder. They reveal how the early scribes of the
          Old Testament inserted lags of time into the Exodus story to cover
          Moses’ assassination and replacement, fabricated Moses’ origin story,
          and changed the location of the “Mountain of God” from Edom, where
          Reuel was a prince, to Sinai. <br /><br />Unveiling the enigma of
          Moses’ real story--and his murder and replacement--the Flem-Aths
          dramatically challenge the time line and details of biblical history,
          exposing a cover-up at the very origins of Western religion.

          “This culmination of many years of exhaustive, in-depth research
          reaches fascinating conclusions that are far more than mere
          speculation. The Flem-Aths survey perennial Jewish folklore as well as
          a myriad of previous investigators’ findings in order to demonstrate
          how Old Testament scribes altered those biblical texts to favor the
          biases of the priesthood. I learned much more sensible history from
          this intriguing work than any Sunday school class would ever be
          permitted to teach.”
