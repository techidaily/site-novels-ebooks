          <b>Ilana Harkavy</b> started her career as a recording artist and<br />songwriter
          in Los Angeles, creating electronic dance music for ABC, Disney, HBO,
          and more. Even as her career skyrocketed, she began to feel
          dissatisfied. She knew she needed another outlet to express her true
          feelings and connect with the people she was most passionate about
          helping. Enter The Just Girl Project--a fiery artistic movement that
          empowers girls to embrace their passions, be blatantly honest, and
          take ownership of their individual struggles.<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><b
