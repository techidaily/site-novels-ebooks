            Playful Mindfulness brings together wisdom from the worlds of
            mindfulness (paying attention to the present moment with curiosity
            and kindness) and improvisation (making life up courageously as you
            go along) so readers can find greater confidence, calm, and
            connection.
          </p>
          <p>CONFIDENCE. CALM. CONNECTION.</p>
          Do you long to express that creative project or idea but tell yourself
          you’re not good or clever or funny enough, so why even try?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Do
          you dream of a wide-open life filled with moments of wonder, delight
          and surprise but find yourself trapped in routine and smothered by
          stress?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Do you yearn for deep, meaningful connection
          with those around you but feel yourself ever more isolated by social
          media and modern technology?
          <p>HOPE IS ON THE WAY.</p>
          <p>
            In these pages, Ted DesMaisons takes your hand and leads you on a
            beautiful, surprising and unruly adventure into the lands where
            mindfulness and improvisation overlap. There, you’ll discover the
            same freedom, ease, and joy that thousands of his students at
            Stanford and elsewhere have found for themselves.

          “Ted DesMaisons brings decades of experience as a student, teacher and
          philosopher to bear in this book. He charts new territory in blending
          improv and mindfulness. There is a lightness to this approach,
          but&nbsp;<strong
            >make no mistake: this book offers profound life advice</strong
          >.”

        <p>--Patricia Ryan Madson, author of&nbsp;Improv Wisdom</p>
        <p>
          “<strong>This is the stuff of transformation.&nbsp;</strong>I found
          mindfulness and creativity heroism here and my work as a teacher,
          husband and father are more grounded for it. If you want a gentle path
          toward nurturing your soul,&nbsp;Ted DesMaisons understands how to
          bring both inspiration and calm to the human experience.”

            practitioner!&nbsp;</strong
          >Ted masterfully takes us to the enthralling and alluring place where
          mindfulness and improv meet. Along the way we learn a variety of
          lessons - including how to skillfully relate to failure, how to tap
          into the creativity of the present, and —maybe most importantly—how to
          have more fun in our life and practice!"&nbsp;

          podcast with Lisa Rowland, Ted DesMaisons invites you to get
          passionately and positively present in your life. Like a good friend
          taking you on a pleasant walk, this book demonstrates the
          opportunities and advantages of curiosity and provides a simple, clear
          way to use both improvisation and mindfulness to&nbsp;<strong
            >become&nbsp;</strong

          happiness. I worry less—and dance more!”

            insight</strong

          courage, gratitude, and a growth mindset—and he’s included a rich
          glossary of improv games and exercises. I highly
          recommend&nbsp;Playful Mindfulnessfor educators and facilitators and
