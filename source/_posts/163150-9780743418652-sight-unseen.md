          <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>Witnessed, Intruders,</i> and <i>Missing Time</i> -- three
          groundbreaking books on the UFO phenomenon -- returns with astonishing
          evidence that other-worldly beings are a very real -- and growing --
          part of our lives. <br />
          <i>In Sight Unseen,</i> Budd Hopkins and coauthor Carol Rainey show
          how fascinating discoveries in modern science support the plausibility
          of the UFO phenomenon. <br />
          Featuring sixteen never-before-published cases,
          <i>Sight Unseen</i> probes two newly uncovered patterns in alien
          abduction: cases of UFO "invisibility" and reports of genetically
          altered alien beings who interact with humans during their routine
          lives. <br />
          The "invisibility" accounts detailed by Hopkins include numerous
          daylight abductions in densely populated urban areas -- all apparently
          unseen and accomplished through a technology of invisibility.<br />
          <br />
          <b
            >Two air force non-coms are snatched from the tarmac of a busy
            military airfield. <br />
            An Australian family is levitated up into a hovering craft while the
            father remains paralyzed on the ground with a camera to his eye. The
            resulting evidence on film is discussed in terms of our own
            scientific advances.</b
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          In the second series of cases, abductees report encounters with beings
          who appear human but apparently possess paranormal powers and stunted
          emotional ranges.<br />
          <br />
          <b
            >Three young women, unknown to each other, are mysteriously summoned
            to "job interviews." In ordinary office settings, they encounter
            human-looking beings who lead them into baffling UFO abduction
            experiences. <br />
            A Wisconsin farmer meets "Damoe," a man with odd behavior who
            closely resembles his son. Damoe eventually reveals himself as an
            accomplice of UFO occupants in a startling abduction of the farmer
            and his wife. <br />
            Five-year-old Jen is abducted at night to a nearby playground. There
            she must teach the techniques and skills of "play" to twelve
            seemingly identical, quasi-human children.</b
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          Along with these bizarre, first-person stories told by credible
          people, Hopkins and Rainey explore cutting-edge advances in our own
          technologies and scientific theories that show how these new UFO
          patterns could have a concrete basis in contemporary science. <br />
          Included are an examination of cloaking devices for aircraft,
          mind-control technologies, and teleportation achieved in the lab.
          Perhaps the most compelling argument to support these cases lies in
          the startling and controversial new science of transgenics that
          actually allows for the creation of alien/human beings.
