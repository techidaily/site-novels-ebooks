          Everyone, regardless of nationality, religion, or political beliefs,
          has&nbsp;a sense of the current crisis of planet Earth. The
          environmental movement has support around the globe, while
          politicians&nbsp;— lagging behind reality — are still fighting over
          whether global warming exists. Decision-makers in government and in
          the private sector are dealing with the symptoms of this crisis,
          rather than addressing the underlying causes&nbsp;in a positive and
          constructive way. Osho points out that the current world crisis is a
          crisis of consciousness. Until there is a radical change in human
          consciousness, the interrelated social, political, economic, and
          ecological crises we face will continue. Osho's radical vision of
          change&nbsp;addresses how we can turn the&nbsp;present crisis into an
          opportunity, and what we must do in order to steer our course toward a
          "golden future"&nbsp;for all humankind and away from what he calls a
          "global suicide." Topics addressed in the book include the crisis of
          human values, the ecological crisis, the population challenge, the end
          of nations and religions, creative science, education, and human
          rights.

          Excerpt from Preface of the book:<br /><br />The future should not be
          just a hope and opportunity; those are just lousy words. The future
          should be absolutely ours it should be a golden future. We have lived
          with the idea of a golden past which was never golden! But we can
          create a future that is really golden.<br />Now is a great moment. We
          can manage to have one world. This crisis is a golden crisis, because
          people change only under conditions of such deep stress. As long as
          the situation is tolerable, people will tolerate it but now we are at
          a point where the situation is not tolerable. There is no more time
          for commissions and their reports.<br />The problems are very simple.
          It is just that it has to be made clear to the whole humanity that
          these problems are your creation, and you are still creating them. A
          great awareness has to be spread: These are the problems you are
          supporting. Withdraw your support.”<br />And some practical steps
          should be taken for example, if someone wants to be a world citizen,
          the United Nations should provide world citizen passports, not
          connected with any nation. Just small steps can have a large impact
          immediately, they will create an atmosphere. This crisis has been
          created by religions and nationalities, and it has come to the point
          where they cannot exist anymore.<br />If anything is to be done for
          the future, now is the time. Otherwise the greatest evolution of
          consciousness in the universe will disappear and that is not only a
          loss to the earth, but to the whole of existence. In a million years
          we have been able to create some possibility of consciousness. But now
          we don’t have time to wait for nature to go on developing in its slow
          way. It has eternity, but we don’t have.<br />If we are going to solve
          the future and dissolve the problems, then we have to look for the
          roots in the past. It is our whole past, in all its dimensions, that
          has brought about this dangerous situation and nobody talks about
          that, because no generation before this has ever bothered about the
          future. Man has always been living the way he wanted, and forced each
          new generation to live in the same way. This is no longer possible. We
          have to take a quantum leap to teach the new generation not to live
          the same way we have lived. Only then can the future be shifted.<br /><br /><br />
