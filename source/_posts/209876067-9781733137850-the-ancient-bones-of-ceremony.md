            Step into the mysteries of the ancient ways as you travel on an
            allegorical journey to explore the many dynamic aspects of what
            makes a ceremony transformative for yourself, your family and your
            community.

            Weddings, rites of passage, baby blessings, funerals, yes, and also
            life changes that are not typically honored: loss of relationship,
            divorce, new home, new job, eldership and retirement.

            For many of us, the formats provided by higher authorities are not
            enough, and imitating traditions of other cultures is controversial.
            We need to return to the bare bones of ceremony and create
            transformative events that are personalized to our own lives and the
            culture we live in. This is where our power lies.

          energy is unpredictableHold ethical and safe space for others
          <p>
            Tasara Stone’s lyrical writing, which includes prayers, blessings,
            and paeans of gratitude, transports us to a sacred landscape where
            our heart’s needs are treated with utmost care. We tune into the
            light that glows at our core, connecting us to all of life. We spend
            time with Mother Earth and her elemental spirits, who teach us to
            walk the sacred spiral path. We learn about the importance of
            aligning ourselves with the cycles of growing and dying, accepting
            and letting go. Only with this wisdom and love can we craft and
            experience ceremonies that are truly transformative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tasara Stone offers us not only a practical guide, she gives us a
            powerful and moving experience of the energies that will nourish our
            practice. Her words root us in the very soil out of which ceremony
            grows. Fully engaged, heart, mind, body and soul, we come to
            understand how the wisdom of ancient times can help us cultivate an
            authentic spiritual practice in the midst of modern life. This is
            another essential gift of The Ancient Bones. As we contemplate the
            lies and distortions that bombard us daily, we come to understand
            ceremony as a way of creating alternative stories for ourselves,
            ones that give our lives true meaning.

          Ceremony is ineffable, nearly impossible to capture or describe, and
          infinitely variable. Yet Stone's The Ancient Bones of Ceremony
          approaches the subject with deep respect, profound understanding, and
          a wealth of experience. What's more, she succeeds in laying out a path
          through all the aspects of ceremony that is clear yet poetic. Just to
          read it is to be drawn into timelessness and connection. Reading it is
          a ceremony, in that you lay aside daily concerns and travel on the
          currents of love and connection. Her voice is consistent and lyrical,
          and it's obvious she has the requisite years of experience and
          training to write about this subject. This is a book to read and
          re-read, to dream over, to act with."

          <strong>Re-Grounding Ritual</strong>In this remarkable book, Tasara
          Jen Stone invites us to reclaim our spiritual roots in the sacred
          ground from which all ceremony arises. Her reflections are a summons
          to listen to the rhythms of the earth, so that they might resonate
          anew in our human journey. This is a deeply personal book, but its
          implications take us beyond the personal to the wider religious crisis
          of our culture. For some time now, Christian ceremony has been losing
          its experiential roots in the earth and the cosmos. If other clergy
          read this book, they might-like me-discover a renewed vision of living
          ritual.
