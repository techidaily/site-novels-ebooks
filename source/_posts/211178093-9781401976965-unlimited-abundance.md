            >Understand your true powers of attraction and manifestation. Take a

          ><br /><br />The formula for abundant living can be found in the
          principles of quantum physics and how your personal energy aligns with
          the powerful forces of the Universe. In <i>Unlimited Abundance</i>,
          international speaker <b>Sandra Anne Taylor</b> thoroughly updates and
          expands her classic <i>New York Times</i> bestseller,
          <i>Quantum Success</i>, to reveal how you can achieve immediate and
          spectacular results merely by shifting your life-force energy. This
          book offers many new, effective, and <i>easy</i> techniques to
          accelerate your alignment with Universal energy and the unseen forces
          of success. Those forces exist within you and all around you. They act
          in every part of the human experience—from the workings of the cosmos
          to your personal energetic connections with others. Once you learn how
          to activate these forces, they can elevate your life to levels of
          abundance you never thought possible!
