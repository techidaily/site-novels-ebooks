          ><br /><br />"Continuing the work of her first book, Eileen furthers
          the critical task of counteracting the influence of materialism on
          modern medicine. She takes a major step forward, in the spirit of
          Walter Russell and Nikola Tesla, by integrating consciousness, aether,
          plasma, and electricity into a new paradigm that relates equally well
          to cosmology and biology. She then gives us a map of the body’s
          bioelectric field in order to better understand our own personal
          health challenges. This book is
          <b>as useful as it is thought provoking</b>." -- Dr. Andrew Kaufman<br /><br />"Ongoing
          discoveries in diverse branches of the sciences make it clear that
          western biomedicine has had a limited understanding of the nature of
          the human body and what it takes to create and sustain health. In
          Electric Body, Electric Health, Eileen Day McKusick illuminates one of
          the primary domains missing from the pages of modern medicine: the
          human biofield and its electric nature. In these pages, she shares
          with us her own discoveries of the anatomy and functioning of the
          human biofield and places it front and center in its profound role in
          maintaining our health and overall wellbeing. She simultaneously
          weaves in supportive evidence from biology, physics, and cosmology. As
          a scientist working in the field of mindbody medicine for many years,
          I particularly value the sections describing linkages of how properly
          expressed emotions serve to maintain the health of the biofield and
          consequently our overall electric health. Eileen is fond of saying to
          people, “You are amazing!” because she sees the remarkable beings that
          we are.

          and Training in Integrative Health, The University of California at
          San Diego. Director of Research for the Deepak Chopra Foundation<br /><br />"An
          ancient phrase inscribed on the frontispiece of the Temple of Delphi
          read “Know Thyself.” In Electric Body, Electric Health, Eileen
          McKusick helps us all understand, “we are electromagnetic beings
          bathed in an electrically connected reality.” Eileen shares with us
          how to raise our voltage, through electromagnetic solutions, for
          better health of our body, mind, and spirit. Everything is energy, and
          through this beautifully written book,
          <b>we learn how to bolster our energy</b>, so that we can indeed come
          closer to the state of awareness, that we 'Know Thyself.'" --Dr.
          Steven A. Ross, CEO of World Research Foundation<br /><br />"Eileen
          McKusick teaches us to ‘think electrically’ in her stunning new book
          Electric Body, Electric Health. She turns the world of energy healing
          on its head by proving the point that we are electric beings in an
          electric universe before we are bio-chemical. In it are all the
          concepts and techniques that you need to learn to raise your voltage
          enough to<b>
            live a life of optimal mental, emotional and physical health</b
          >. As always, Eileen’s work is<b>
            brilliant, cutting edge and eminently practical.</b
          >"<br />– Lisa Campion, Author of <i>The Art of Psychic Reiki </i>and
          <i>Energy Healing for Empaths</i><br /><br /><br />"Eileen’s
          pioneering research ushers in a new paradigm of thought that marries
          science and spirituality, for the sake of pursuing whole health.
          Through direct experience, Eileen guides the reader through a
          revolutionary shift in perspective, that we are fundamentally
          electromagnetic and vibrational. I would thoroughly recommend this
          book for anyone seeking tools for personal growth and healing - it is
          a blue print for reclaiming your power, creative authorship and
          electrical sovereignty."<br />--Isaac Koren, Co-Founder, The Brothers
          Koren, and Your Big Voice<br /><br />"Eileen McKusick is that rare
          integration of a fearless scientific voyager with the compassionate
          heart and expertise of an extraordinary healer. In this brilliant
          book, Eileen
          <b>weaves together scientific and practical insights</b> on the nature
          of your Electric Self. In doing so, she urges you to augment your
          healing capacity, and shine as your brilliant, unencumbered self, in a
          time where it is so greatly needed. <b>Highly recommended</b>!" --

            easy access to simple truths about our electric body</b

          teaches us how to take these back in our own hands. I absolutely love
          her work and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to uplevel their

          techniques of shamanic culture. As a representative of the Sakha
          (Arctic Siberian) culture I view this modern description of the
          electric body as an example of the extraordinary skill of our shamans.
          The modern western scientific view often leads to a demystification of
          the magic within and around us. This pioneering work gives us<b>
