          Russel Williams is one of the most remarkable enlightened spiritual
          teachers of our time. After an early life of extreme hardship—leaving
          school at the age of 11, and becoming an orphan shortly afterwards—he
          underwent a spiritual awakening at the age of 29. Since the late
          1950s, he has been a spiritual teacher, and is still actively teaching
          now, at the age of 94. Previously, Russel has avoided publicity and
          never published any writings or transcripts of his talks, preferring
          to work quietly with small groups. This is the first time any details
          of his teachings or of his life have appeared in print. This book is
          partly a record of his teachings, and partly also the story of his
          extraordinary life. Working with well-known spiritual author Steve
          Taylor—who has attended Russel’s meetings regularly since the
          1990s—Russel has created a profound text which will surely become
          known as a classic of spiritual literature.
