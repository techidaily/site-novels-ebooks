          In his highly anticipated English translation of the ancient Irish
          text known as the Lebor Feasa Rnda (Book of Secret Knowledge), Celtic
          scholar and historian, Steven L. Akins, has at last made available to
          readers the wealth of pre-Christian teachings espoused by the Druids
          in this seminal work of pagan religious literature. Basing his
          translation on the only extant transcription of the now lost Black
          Book of Loughcrew, the actual doctrines of the Celtic priesthood are
          finally brought to light in this timeless rendering of these sacred
          scriptures.Of the 180 Druidic texts mentioned in the historic Yellow
          Book of Lecan as being destroyed by St. Patrick in his attempt to
          convert the pagan inhabitants of Ireland to Christianity, the Lebor
          Feasa Rnda alone survived as testimony to the spiritual beliefs and
          practices of the Celts in their original, uncompromised form. First
          transcribed by the Druid Mogh Ruith from a series of ogham staves long
          ago discovered in the tomb of Ollamh Fodhla, one of Irelands greatest
          early kings, the Lebor Feasa Runda records the dispensation of a vast
          store of esoteric knowledge received by Ollamh Fodhla from a messenger
          of the Celtic gods known as the Tuatha D Danann.Perhaps the most
          remarkable of all ancient Celtic texts, the Lebor Feasa Rnda contains
          not only an account of the earliest history of Ireland and the
          relationship of its inhabitants to the Celtic gods, but it also
          comprises a full discourse on the Druidic religion, providing a
          complete account of the sacred rites and ceremonies at the heart of
          this mysterious faith.Since it was first recorded in the Black Book of
          Loughcrew, the Lebor Feasa Rnda miraculously survived for centuries,
          traveling across Europe and passing through the hands of numerous
          individuals until it was ultimately acquired by the Ahnenerbe
          Forschungs-und Lehrgemeinschaf, who commissioned its translation into
          German in the days leading up to the Second World War.The original
          volume was found missing on May 10, 1941, the date Rudolf Hess, made
          his ill-fated flight to Great Britain, lending support to allegations
          that Hitlers deputy Fhrer had taken the ancient manuscript with the
          intention of presenting it as a gift to the Duke of Hamilton and
          Brandon, who Hess planned to meet for the purpose of secretly
          discussing peace negotiations between Germany and Britain.In the years
          since its disappearance, the only known transcription of the Lebor
          Feasa Rnda, the German translation prepared by Henry Thorenson for the
          Ahnenerbe, fell into obscurity until 2001 when it was discovered by
          Akins, who was granted access to Thorensons private records, enabling
          him to complete and publish the first English edition of this
          remarkable and historic work.
