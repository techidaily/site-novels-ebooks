          • Details the rise and fall of this famous and infamous Order,
          including its penetration of Bavarian society and its destruction by
          the Bavarian government <br /><br />• Explains the Bavarian
          Illuminati’s grades, rituals, ceremonies, and fundamental philosophies
          and examines the leaders of the Order <br /><br />• Contains the only
          surviving record of documents that were destroyed during the two World
          Wars <br /><br />The Bavarian Order of the Illuminati is the most
          celebrated secret society in the world. Though officially lasting only
          11 years, the powerful spell and shadow cast by the Illuminati still
          looms in the present day, where its influence can be seen in current
          conspiracy beliefs and actions by powerful individuals working in the
          shadows. The original Order of the Illuminati was founded by Bavarian
          professor Adam Weishaupt in 1776. Although the order was banned and
          brought down by the Bavarian Elector in 1787--when he became aware of
          the extent to which it had infiltrated the courts, schools, and his
          own administration--its legend and deep influence lives on to this
          day. <br /><br />Charting the rise and fall of this infamous order,
          this book--first published in French in 1915 and never before
          available in English--remains the definitive history of the Order of
          the Bavarian Illuminati. It also offers a revealing look at the world
          that spawned and shaped it: a ceaseless ferment of revolutionary and
          occult ideas and the ceaseless attempts by crown and church to
          suppress them. Other secret societies that shared the stage with the
          Illuminati during these years include the Templar Strict Observance,
          von Hund’s Templar Freemasonry, and other Masonic lodges the
          Illuminati targeted to subvert for their own purposes. Many of the
          documents the author consulted for the writing of this book were
          destroyed during the two World Wars, making this book the only
          surviving record of many of the order’s secrets. <br /><br />The
          author explains the Bavarian Illuminati’s grades, rituals, and
          ceremonies as well as its fundamental philosophies. He paints vivid
          portraits of the leaders of the order, including Weishaupt, Baron
          Knigge, and Xavier von Zwack. He reveals how Weishaupt early on
          decided to subvert the existing German Freemason Lodge as a shortcut
          to gain esoteric hegemony over the occult world, all in order to
          extend Illuminati influence into the society at large and the
          government. The author also provides extensive detail of the order’s
          eventual destruction by the Bavarian government. <br /><br />In
          addition to its revelation of little-known secrets of the Illuminati
          Order, the author also sheds new light on much of the occult life of
          this time, including the activities of figures such as Cagliostro and
          Mirabeau and other active groups such as Freemason chapters, the
          Rosicrucians, and the Martinists.
