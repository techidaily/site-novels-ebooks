          Mayan daykeeper Hunbatz Men reveals the multi-calendar system of the
          Maya that guided the lives of his ancestors and how it can guide us
          today <br />
          <br />• The first book to reveal the secrets of the Mayan Pleiades
          calendar: the Tzek’eb <br />
          <br />• Explains how the Maya used their astronomical knowledge to
          guide their lives on Earth <br />
          <br />The Mayan Calendar has taken on special prominence with the
          imminent arrival of 2012, a date that many claim is the end of that
          calendar. However, as Mayan elder and daykeeper Hunbatz Men shows, the
          cosmological understanding of his ancestors was so sophisticated that
          they had not one, but many calendars, each based on the cycles of
          different systems in the cosmos. In this book he reveals for the first
          time the Tzek’eb, or Pleiades, Calendar of 26,000 years, which charts
          the revolution of our solar system around Alcyone, the central star of
          the Pleiades system. He also discusses the K’uuk’ulcan Calendar of the
          4 seasons of the solar year and the wheel of the K’altunes Calendar,
          which is composed of 13 cycles of 20 years each that form a calendar
          of 260 years. <br />
          <br />In traditional Mayan culture the computation of time was not
          determined by simple economic or social motives. The calendars served
          the higher purpose of synchronizing the lives of human beings and
          their societies to the great cosmic pulsation, to the rhythm of the
          annual seasons, and to the other cycles that dictate changes upon
          Earth. Mayan understanding of the cosmic cycles was so exact that this
          knowledge could be used to influence all stages of life--from planning
          when to conceive (parents could choose not only the sex of their child
          but its vocation and future destiny) to plotting out the course of the
          entire society. Pyramids played a crucial role in applying this wisdom
          because, as Hunbatz Men shows, they were able to produce and transform
          energy in accordance with the cosmic cycles charted by the calendars.
          This book reveals for the first time the wisdom of the multi-calendar
          Mayan system and how it can help guide our modern world.
