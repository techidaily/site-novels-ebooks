          By celebrity psychic&nbsp;Uri Geller, this simple, fun and visually
          attractive guide explains how to improve your life by unlocking your
          intuition and learning this ancient but effective divinatory art.<br /><br /><br />Dowsing
          simply means searching for something by intuition. It's widely
          regarded as being a psychic method of looking for water, but it's so
          much more than that – you can dowse for everything from lost objects
          to the self-knowledge hidden in your subconscious – and this book will
          show you exactly how.&nbsp;<br />All of us have intuition but in this
          modern world we have become disconnected from this ancient power. Uri
          Geller is famous around the world for his intuitive, paranormal
          powers, which range from bending spoons to astounding feats of
          dowsing, such as his location of huge offshore oil field on behalf of
          Mexico's national oil company (for which he was rewarded with Mexican
          citizenship). In this amazing book, he guides you step by step through
          the hidden world of dowsing that he knows so well. Simple exercises in
          the form of Uri mini-class activities, and fun games such as crystal
          hide-and-seek, teach the basic skills you need to dowse, whether you
          use divining rods, a pendulum, a forked twig or just your hands. The
          book then explains how to use these skills to find everything from
          lost objects to water, fossils, archaeological remains and even hidden
          treasure! Most importantly, Uri reveals how dowsing can help you
          unlock submerged thoughts and knowledge and evaluate vital choices in
          business, love and family life. Also including real-life case studies
          of amazing dowsing events, stories of celebrity dowsers through
          history and background explanation of the science of dowsing, this is
          a super accessible and fun guide to the most useful of the paranormal
          skills.
