              >“Look into the eyes of a child—you cannot find anything deeper.
              The eyes of a child are an abyss, there is no bottom to
              them.”—Osho</i
            ><br /><br />Children have an authentic freedom. They are joyful,
            playful, and naturally creative. But by the time they grow up, most
            children have been sacrificed to the gods of “productivity” and good
            behavior to the extent that only nostalgia for childhood remains.
            <br /><br />Osho says, “It is the child’s experience that haunts
            intelligent people their whole life. They want it again—the same
            innocence, the same wonder, the same beauty.” And while each adult
            generation may vow, with the best of intentions, not to repeat the
            mistakes of the past, they inevitably find themselves imposing their
            own inherited limitations on new generations to come.<br /><br />This
            book calls for a “children’s liberation movement” to break through
            old patterns and create opportunities for an entirely new way of
            relating as human beings. It is a guide for grown-ups to become
            aware of their own conditioning as they relate to the children in
            their lives. And, with that awareness, to learn when to nurture and
            protect and when to get out of the way, so that children can flower
            into their highest potential and greatest capacity for joy.<br /><br /><b
              >Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the
              conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their
              capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described
              by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the “1000 Makers of
              the 20th Century” and by <i>Sunday Mid-Day </i>(India) as one of
              the ten people—along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha—who have
              changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the
              influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers
              of all ages in virtually every country of the world.</b
