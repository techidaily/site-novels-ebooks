          <b>Explores our intertwined spiritual history with cats</b
          ><br /><br />• Examines spiritual and occult beliefs connected to cats
          from Mayan, Aztec, and Native American mythology as well as from
          ancient India, Samaria, Babylon, Japan, and Egypt<br /><br />• Looks
          at spiritual behaviors attributed to cats as well as modern biological
          research into cat behavior and their highly sophisticated sensory
          systems<br /><br />• Reveals the similarities between cat and human
          emotions and the deep connection between cats and meditation<br /><br />We
          have been connected to cats for more than 30 million years. To our
          prehistoricancestors cats were deadly predators of the night, and
          because of this ancient memory etched onto our DNA, cats epitomize our
          fear of the dark. Yet in addition to their connection to the dark and
          the shadows, their intelligence, sophisticated physical abilities, and
          finely tuned senses also led many cultures to view cats as connected
          to the spirit world. <br /><br />Exploring the spiritual nature of
          cats, John A. Rush looks at humanity’s fascination and fear of cats
          through the ages. He examines spiritual and occult beliefs connected
          to cats from Mayan, Aztec, and Native American mythology as well as
          from ancient India, Samaria, Babylon, Japan, and Egypt, including how
          ancient Egyptians used cats to send messages to the gods. He reveals
          why the Catholic Church demonized cats and how cats are symbols of
          both Good and Evil. Examining cat evolution, the author looks at
          spiritual behaviors attributed to cats as well as modern biological
          research into cat behavior and their highly sophisticated sensory
          systems, which, unlike most other animals, have changed very little
          over millions of years. He explores their “psychic” ability to sense
          what humans cannot and the origins of their glowing eyes, which has
          connected cats, through myth, to both the Underworld and the World of
          Light. He also explores similarities between cat and human emotions,
          cat communications with us, and the deep connection between cats and
          meditation. <br /><br />Revealing the spiritual journey of the cat
          from fearsome predator to occult symbol to household companion, the
          author shows how, in many ways, cats are mirrors of us, reflecting our
          conflicting dual nature that is at once loving yet distant, magical
          yet vengeful, and, above all, deeply connected to the spirit world.

          “Shamanic shapeshifters of human consciousness—these wondrous
          four-legged demi-gods weave in and out of the astral plane influencing
          evolutionary growth on levels humans have yet to comprehend. Cats are
          the gatekeepers into our unconscious world, capable of entering into
          dimensions to impart magic and healing medicine in those spaces where
          wounds hide. They carry the secrets of the universe within their
          souls; lineages of many worlds rooted in tradition pass through them
          and onto their human caretakers. Their distinct meow is heard by every
          angel, as they walk through their existence embodying love and hope.
          They absorb darkness so that our light can shine over and over again
          and ask for nothing in return. May we honor them with the respect they
          truly deserve.”
