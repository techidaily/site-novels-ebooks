              principles, reflections, exercises, and meditations for making

          In times of uncertainty and suffering, finding joy and gratefulness in
          daily life is challenging. <i>Wake Up Grateful</i> provides a
          practical and inspiring roadmap to making grateful living a daily
          practice, with guiding principles, reflective questions, affirmations,
          and exercises. Drawing from her own cancer experience along with her
          life work with The Network for Grateful Living, Kristi Nelson explores
          how to develop gratefulness as a way of being. She examines ten core
          areas where many people need support and guides readers in finding
          presence and perspective in these aspects of life, opening to greater
          possibilities, and uncovering the abundance and love that's possible
          in every moment.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i

          "<i>Wake Up Grateful</i> helped me unfold into a more healed and
          present version of myself… reframing what I thought it meant to be
          grateful and express gratitude."<br />
          — Alexandra Elle, NYT Bestselling Author of <i>How We Heal</i
          ><br /><br />
          “This book reminds us of what is most important and not to be taken
          for granted — and how to align our lives with that vital awakening to
          the beauty and possibility that is always present amidst the darkness
          and the fear.”&nbsp;— Jon Kabat-Zinn,&nbsp;founder of MBSR
          (mindfulness-based stress reduction) and author of&nbsp;<i
            >Full Catastrophe Living</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mindfulness for All</i><br /><br />
          “Like gratefulness itself, the book comfortably holds extremes: it’s
          expansive yet concise, individual yet relational, and personal yet
          universal. It represents an abiding belief in abundance and fierce
          commitment to wonder, but it’s also grounded in reality, recognizing
          that life is uncertain and hard, and that it is lived in a flawed,
          fallible body. Wisdom and grace abound in the text, which is calm and
          cognizant of the fact that people are seeking gratefulness amid raging
          battles and hard circumstances.&nbsp;<i>Wake Up Grateful</i>&nbsp;is
          an invitation to a new way of living, even in the most challenging
          times.” —&nbsp;<i>Foreword Reviews</i>&nbsp;<br /><br />
          “<i>Wake Up Grateful</i> will make you think about gratefulness more
          deeply and give thanks more widely. This is not a book to rush
          through, but to savor. The pages crackle with raw honesty, deep
          wisdom, profound realizations, and practical guidelines. Reading it
          was a true gift, and left me more convinced than ever before that
          gratefulness is the deepest touchpoint of human existence.”&nbsp;—
          Robert Emmons, professor of psychology at University of
          California–Davis, and author of
          <i>Thanks! How Practicing Gratitude Can Make You Happier</i>,
          <i>Gratitude Works!</i>, and <i>The Little Book of Gratitude</i
          ><br /><br />
          “<i>Wake Up Grateful</i> is exquisitely touching, powerful, and real.
          This book will make a lasting difference to those fortunate enough to
          read it. The creation of a new future will be profoundly served by
          this message and the heart and depth from which it comes. I hope this
          book gets into the hands of as many people as possible.”&nbsp;— Lynne
          Twist, author of <i>The Soul of Money</i> and founder of SOMI<br /><br />
          “Kristi Nelson has written a book absolutely packed with information
          that is both inspiring and practical. This is a difficult balance to
          achieve, and she has done it beautifully.&nbsp;Put this book on your
          nightstand and read a little bit every day.”&nbsp;— Stephen Cope,
          Scholar Emeritus, Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health and best-selling
          author of <i>The Great Work of Your Life</i><br /><br />
          “The capacity to look at oneself and one’s life exactly as they are
          with gratefulness is the capacity most needed to live fully, rise
          through suffering, and contribute to the well-being of the world.
          Kristi Nelson’s inspired work ought to be in every school desk and
          hotel nightstand and on every kitchen counter. With her guidance we
          are prepared to hold our lives tenderly, be kind, and love each other
          fully.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;Maria Sirois, Psy.D., author of
          <i
            >A Short Course in Happiness After Loss (and Other Dark, Difficult
            Times)</i
          ><br /><br />
          “The most valuable spiritual guidebooks are grounded in the writer's
          personal awakening. Cancer taught Kristi Nelson to accept the
          uncertainty and impermanence of life, and through that she discovered
          gratefulness as a path to healing and wholeness. Now she offers it to
          us, and it is a blessing to receive.”&nbsp;— Mirabai Bush, Senior
          Fellow, Center for Contemplative Mind in Society and coauthor of
          <i>Walking Each Other Home: Conversations on Loving and Dying</i>
