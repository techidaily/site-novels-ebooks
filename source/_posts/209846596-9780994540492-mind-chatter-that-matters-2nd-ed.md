            Are you tired of feeling stuck, indecisive by endless Mind Chatter?
            Why do some people succeed, while others do not? There is a
            depression and mental illness epidemic in the world today due to
            life's stresses. We all experience negative events in our life and
            are each affected very differently. Often, these decisions are
            driven by a lack of love in our lives, fear of rejection, or
            abandonment, rather than growing, moving past our pain, and
            enriching our life with true joy and happiness. Whilst we all have
            conflict within our minds, learning to understand the four different
            voices within your mind, and their agenda, is paramount to
            understanding the psyche. So many people are meandering through
            life, with no real direction other than following the expectations
            of their society/family/relationship, feeling numb and unaccounted
            for, with no real clue as to their true purpose and passions for
            their life. Fascinating, illuminating, and compelling, Mind Chatter
            That Matters...will show you • How your negative experiences hold
            you back from growing and being happy • How you may self-sabotage
            when you experience pain, depression, anxiety, and abandonment, or
            just feel you don't fit in • How to witness the conflict, and get a
            win-win with your inner conflict • How you to gain control over who
            your decision maker is • Tools to overcome anything you have been
            through • How to integrate your Intuitive Self to your ego mind •
            How to learn the tools within allow you to flourish, regardless of
            your experiences. Through her no-nonsense style, and loving
            approach, Liz Atherton provides non-stop insights, and practical
            observations, as to how the psyche gets overloaded when conflict
            occurs. Using Sigmund Freud, and Carl Jung's philosophies, taught in
            psychology classes throughout the world, she clearly explains how it
            all fits together, so you can embrace your life....your way. This
            inspiring, and empowering book, will bring welcome relief to anyone
            who ever felt like they didn't have all the answers to their life's
            happiness.
