          From the preface: This book looks at virtue as "the power to do good"
          from the theological, philosophical, and poetic perspective. From a
          theological perspective: Long ago, Anselm defined theology as "faith
          seeking understanding," (f. 1) a definition which has endured to the
          present day. It would be difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to
          try to understand virtue or goodness without looking through some lens
          of faith.…Get Goodness was written, in part, because my own faith was
          seeking understanding. Second, this book will look at virtue and
          goodness from a philosophical perspective because the word
          "philosophy" (from the Greek philos + sophia) means "love of wisdom."
          (f.2)…As we will find in this book, the virtue of love has been
          understood by most theologians and philosophers before me to be the
          essence of each and every virtue. Therefore, we must first love wisdom
          before we are able to practically discern, distinguish, deliberate and
          decide prudently in any effort to understand how virtue is the power
          to do good.… Third, this book will be suffused with poetry….because
          poetry is a language that goes beyond logic, thought, and reason…. It
          is a language of the spirit and a language of human life, love,
          observation, and experience….Any poem is an attempt to try to
          understand the experience of the world and the universe around us in
          spiritual terms. None of us should be seeking virtuous perfection in
          orienting ourselves to the good in this life; we should only be
          seeking change. The journey is the goal.

        </h4>
        <p>
          In this book, Hickey has transformed what can be a dry topic from
          antiquity into a living relevant study ready to apply in our lives
          today. He examines the virtues and idea of goodness from philosophical
          and theological perspectives, with the fascinating addition of
          integrating poetry relevant to the concepts discussed in prose. Hickey
          is able to write from a scholarly background illuminating words and
          phrases through etymology without becoming difficult to understand or
          obscure. His well-researched academic perspective adds to the book,
          rather than causing it to be dense and cryptic.

          executive director of two charitable non-profits focused on third
          world and U.S. poverty, he eventually began his own marketing
          business. He retired as a successful entrepreneur to become a full
          time writer and poet. His first book, Get Wisdom, published in 2006.
          He writes a weekly column called "Words Of Wisdom" for The Naples
          Daily News and teaches courses on religion, philosophy, and poetry at
          Hodges University, CLL and Florida Gulf Coast University, RA. His
          wife, Theresa, is a published poet, and in their forty-four years
          together they have raised four happy and "well-adjusted" children into
          adulthood.
