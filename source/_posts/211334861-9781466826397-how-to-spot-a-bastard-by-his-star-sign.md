          <b>Adele Lang</b> was born in London, but moved to Perth, Australia
          when she was 16, living mostly in Melbourne after that, and finally
          she moved back to London in 1997. She also began her career as an
          advertising copywriter, but segued into TV scriptwriting (in
          Australia), magazine columnist, newspaper feature writer, and author.
          She has had several books published, including <i>Bosstrology</i>,
          <i>The Best Book of Girls Behaving Badly... Ever </i>and
          <i>How To Spot a Bastard by His Star Sign</i>. Currently Adele is the
          astrology columnist for <i>Marie Claire</i>.<br /><br /><b

          has been an art director, copywriter, and graphic designer, and has
          won numerous awards including the covered advertising CLIO award
          (1997). But all the while she has had an abiding interest in
          everything "new age", particularly astrology. Originally from
          Malaysia, Susi lived most of her life all across Australia and New
          Zealand, and she and her husband recently moved to California.
