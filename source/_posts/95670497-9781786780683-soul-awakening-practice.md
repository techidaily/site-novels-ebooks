          A mantra for a new consciousness with an introduction by Lynne
          McTaggart and contributions by Ervin László, Michael Singer, Barbara
          Marx Hubbard, Anodea Judith, Kabir Helminski and Mona Polacca.<br /><br /><i
            >The Soul Awakening Practice</i
          >&nbsp;is built around a&nbsp;6-line mantra. A mantra is a sacred
          utterance. Repetition of a mantra aids in concentration and is
          believed to have both psychological and sacred powers. This is a book
          for activists, for ecologists, and for spiritual seekers engaged in
          the quest for a spiritually coherent and united worldview.<br /><br />The
          human race has a moral imperative to transform the way we live
          and&nbsp;<i>The Soul Awakening Practice</i>&nbsp;offers a way for us
          to engage spiritually. Integrating ancient wisdom, modern science and
          psychology this mantra prayer is a means by which to reveal a coherent
          worldview available to each and every one of us.<br /><br />Written by
          James O’Dea, the former president of the Institute of Noetic Sciences
          and member of the Evolutionary Leaders Group, the book not only
          includes the prayer itself but a commentary on the power of prayer as
          well as expanded, contemplative line-by-line reflections and
          explanations. To provide different viewpoints and perspectives on this
          new worldview, the book includes commentaries by key luminaries from
          science, cosmology, evolutionary theory, Yoga, Sufism and indigenous
          wisdom.<br /><br />Be receptive and allow the prayer to illuminate
          your insights. Experience your own unique journey of awakening.

          world's pioneering sacred activists will open your mind, inspire your

          <i>Soul Awakening Practice </i>provides a stirring and uplifting
          context to weave together prayer, contemplation and action. As such it
          offers us poetic and spiritual guidance for a time that cries out for
          this kind of deep integration. <b>--Seane Corn, Yoga Teacher</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          I have often said that prayer is the broom that sweeps out our
          hearts.&nbsp; <u>Soul Awakening Practice</u> presents reflections that
          will assist you to further develop or continue in your prayer
          practice.&nbsp; With this prayerful cleaning of our heart, it is
          possible for us to receive the true gift--peace.&nbsp; When we are in
          pieces, that's what we share with the world but when we are in peace,
          we manifest peace, we exude peace and we spread peace.
          <b>--H.H. Pujya Swami Chidanand Saraswatiji</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The need for cooperation and partnership as opposed to domination and
          dominion is becoming more and more evident in these threshold times.
          Many are calling for peace in our times and James O’Dea makes the case
          that peace calls for dynamic engagement. It requires the building of
          trust that allows love to flow so that compassionate connection can
          interrupt the cycles of wounding. <i>Soul Awakening Practice</i> is a
          handbook that reveals a path forward as it skillfully guides us to an
          awakening of the heart to the full expression of peace. I highly
          recommend this book which offers grounded practices that will be a
          revolution in your daily life.<br />

          With passions and anxiety high, we are called<br />
          to find power from within. <i>Soul Awakening Practice</i><br />
          is not only on time, but a guide to help everyone<br />
          re-connect to their Source of power. James O'Dea's&nbsp; <br />
          uncanny ability and clarity is spot on for bringing<br />
          us all to a deeper, more powerful way of living.<br />
