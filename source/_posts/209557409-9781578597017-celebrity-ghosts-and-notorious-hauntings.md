          <b>Rich. Famous. Glamorous. Dead … and Immortal!</b>
          <p>
            From old Hollywood silent film stars to rock stars to athletes, past
            presidents, and famous generals, celebrated individuals sometimes
            become celebrity ghosts, and they haunt their homes, workplaces, and
            even burial places. In turn, those places become famous, even
            notorious, thanks to the ghost that is haunting it!
            <i><b>Celebrity Ghosts and Notorious Hauntings</b></i> looks at many
            famous ghosts—dead celebrities that haunt old Hollywood locales,
            famous generals that appear to witnesses at great battlefields, and
            noted politicians that roam the hallways of courthouses,
            statehouses, and even the White House! Plus, this fascinating
            frightfest examines the famous haunted locations themselves, such as
            the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, the Hotel del Coronado, Gettysburg,
            the Stanley Hotel (which inspired Stephen King’s <i>The Shining</i>)
            and so many others that claim the supernatural as part of their
            heritage and history.
          </p>
          <p>
            This riveting look at the unexplained also investigates movie lore,
            including the unsettling incidents on the Amityville Horror set;
            “The Dark Knight” curse that includes on-set accidents from the
            horrible death of Heath Ledger, who played the Joker, to the mass
            shooting at a midnight screening of <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>;
            the deaths and curse surrounding <i>The Matrix</i>; the Infamous
            Stage 28 at Universal Studios; and Paramount Studios’ long history
            of hauntings and strange goings-on.

            V. Rudolph Valentino, Mary Pickford, Marilyn Monroe, and “Superman”
            actor George Reeves. Houdini, Redd Foxx, Liberace, and serial-killer
            Ted Bundy. They all lurk in this riveting book. Haunted graveyards
            (of course), haunted historical landmarks and battlefields, plus
            haunted libraries, courthouses, ships, submarines, lighthouses,
            hotels, roadways, byways, bridges, prisons, and hospitals are all
            gathered together in this comprehensive look at the ghastly
            afterlife of the renowned. From famous faces to famous places, if it
            involves fame and celebrity, fortune and notoriety, legend and lore,
            <i><b>Celebrity Ghosts and Notorious Hauntings</b></i> covers it.
