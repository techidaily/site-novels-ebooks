            <b>Connect with your own spirit guide and transform your life</b
            ><br /><br /><i>Spirit Translator</i> is a remarkable book that
            gives readers the tools to find and connect with their spirit guide.
            In her work as a spirit translator, Diana Cole has asked spirit
            thousands of questions on behalf of her clients and herself. These
            messages are distilled into the seven transformative truths for
            well-being and happiness that form the backbone of the book. She
            outlines her own walk with spirit; how she transformed a shattered
            career and broken relationships into a fulfilling life with the help
            of her spirit guide. Most importantly, Diana helps readers meet and
            begin a new relationship with their own spirit guides, a dialogue
            that will transform their lives.<br /><br />At its heart,
            <i>Spirit Translator </i>is a book of self-empowerment, giving
            readers the knowledge to begin a conversation with spirit that will
            be a lifelong source of well-being and love.

          "Diana Cole has a rare gift that she has lived with for a lifetime,
          one that she is only now bringing to the world stage. She is the
          Spirit Translator, using her direct line of communication with the
          invisible world to answer the questions that matter most to each of
          us. Connect with Diana in person or online, and prepare to live the
          life you have always dreamed of."—Jack Canfield, originator of the
          Chicken Soup for the Soul series<br /><br />“Having been a part of the
          transformational field for over twenty years, I think it’s rare to
          encounter someone like Diana Cole, an emerging teacher of exceptional
          skill. She merges intuition, compassion, and wisdom — and all with a
          laser-like intelligence that wakes people up.”<br />—Kristine Carlson,
          co-author of the Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff Series<br /><br />“Diana
          Cole has a precious and rare gift to clearly connect with your soul
          and then deliver to you articulate messages that are meaningful and
          useful. She possesses a unique combination of innocence, humility and
          deep wisdom.”<br />—Arielle Ford, author, speaker, relationship
          expert<br /><br />“<i>Spirit Translator</i> is an important book and
          Diana Cole is the real deal. This book will awaken you to the
          importance of listening to your inner wisdom—plus give you the tools
          you need to hear your spirit guides and better understand why we
          experience difficulties. You will learn how to turn pain into purpose.
          Diana gently nudges you forward—helping you to step into your full
          power, so you can show the world who you truly are—no matter what
          you've been through. Or rather, thanks to what you've been through. If
          you're ready to change your life, read this book!” <br />—Karen
          Salmansohn, Multi bestselling author<br /><br />"Diana Cole is a
          conduit for miracles to happen. She is so clear and so committed to
          well-being that when she turns her intuitive abilities in your
          direction, positive change is inevitable. <i>Spirit Translator</i> is
          the book that makes her gifts available to the whole world for the
          first time." <br />—Marci Shimoff, #1 New York Times bestselling
          author of <i>Happy for No Reason</i> <br /><br />"I am so grateful
          that Diana Cole has finally said yes to her gift of connection with
          spirit and invited us all in, giving us a front row seat. We get to
          see her innate ability to not just listen but smell and taste the
          world beyond. She indeed reminds us of our own divine invisibility by
          making the spirit world visible and audible." <br />—Christina
          Rasmussen, Author of <i>Where Did You Go? </i>
