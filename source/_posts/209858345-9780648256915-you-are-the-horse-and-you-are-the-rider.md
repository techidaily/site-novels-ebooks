            absorbing, thoughtful book providing excellent explanations od
            functional and dysfunctional behaviour packed full of relevant
            examples from the authors vast professional background and offers
            cutting edge thinking. This work is rich with story, graphics and an

            "This book is a veritable global nomad's guide to the galaxies, all
            of them; replete with the humour and pragmatism from Down Under.
            Having worked as a physician for decades with expatriates in
            overseas settings, there has always been a need for great resource
            books, and here's one you should read and have! The introduction
            presents the concept of the disparate horse and rider. Through
            vignettes and well illustrated rich scientific theory this concept
            grows through the book, culminating in a cleverly integrated
            function as a "Centaured Being". This will join my list of
            recommended readings. In the waiting room or on the coffee table, it
            will inspire conversation, introspection and action."
