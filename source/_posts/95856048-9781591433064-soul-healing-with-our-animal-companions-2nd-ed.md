          A guide to understanding the profound connection in animal/human
          relationships and its potential for mutual healing <br /><br />• 2020
          Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold Award <br /><br />• Explains the
          unspoken connection between people and their animal companions and how
          they share the same energetic patterns and emotional wounds
          <br /><br />• Outlines specific behavioral traits and physical issues
          that animals may exhibit as they mirror their caregiver’s emotional
          state of being <br /><br />• Explores holistic modalities humans can
          employ, such as energy therapy, to promote healing in animals and
          ultimately themselves <br /><br />The animals we attract in our lives
          reflect us in many ways. Our connections with them run deeply, down to
          the soul level. Just like us, they are also on a journey to evolve
          their soul through their relationships and experiences, and each has
          deeply spiritual messages for us and intentions for our personal
          growth. In this book, Tammy Billups invites you to explore and deepen
          this profound relationship, showing how you can co-evolve along with
          your animal companions, experience unconditional love, and,
          ultimately, enact healing for both animal and caregiver.
          <br /><br />Offering a soulful and bioenergetic perspective on
          decoding our animals’ actions, behaviors, and physical issues, Billups
          explains how our animal companions share our energetic patterns and
          emotional wounds, revealing issues in our own lives that may be hidden
          or suppressed. She identifies the five core emotional wounds in
          animals and the ways in which they manifest, outlining specific
          behavioral traits and physical issues animals may exhibit as they
          mirror our emotional states. She explains how to connect with them on
          a profound level so we can grasp their needs more clearly and learn
          what they have to teach us. She also provides guidance to help your
          animals heal the emotional wounds and traumas that create their
          anxiety, stress behaviors, aggression, and fears. <br /><br />The
          author details a three-step process to help you through decisions you
          will make on your pets’ behalf and explains how, when a person works
          on healing a core emotional issue in their life--abandonment for
          example--it helps the animal release this same issue and the
          corresponding negative behaviors as well. She also shows how extremely
          receptive animals are to energy work, holistic healing, and spiritual
          practices, explaining how these methods unlock emotional barriers and
          enable both person and animal to heal and reach their highest
          potential in conscious evolution. <br /><br />Providing tools to
          identify our animals’ messages more quickly, the author shows how our
          pets’ higher purpose is to help people understand themselves.

          “<i>Soul Healing with Our Animal Companions</i> gives the reader a
          more conscious understanding of the relationship between humans and
          their pets. This book shows how animals mirror our own lives and
          emotions and gift us endless blessings that many times we completely
          miss. By understanding how we are in relationship with our pets, we
          can more quickly help them to feel better. My wish is for all people
          to have exposure to the vast knowledge and teachings of
          <i>Soul Healing with Our Animal Companions</i> for their own healing
          and the wellbeing of their pets. Thanks, Tammy, for sharing your
          knowledge, guidance, and gifts with us!”
