          A young boy nearly paralyzed in a car accident runs for the first time
          in his life during a baseball game. A refugee family from despoiled
          East Africa plays soccer in my suburban backyard on Thanksgiving Day.
          A group of college boys is challenged to a game of basketball against
          the women’s varsity team in an empty gym, then another on a tough
          inner city court. I hit the first homerun of my life when I am
          thirty-three years old. These are Ordinary Games. <br />This is a book
          of pure inspiration. Many of the sporting world’s most profound
          achievements and displays of humanity are never recorded. They happen
          on sandlots, asphalt, and backyards. Stories of well-known athletes
          and teams abound in popular literature – what is missing is an
          exaltation of the moments that can happen to any of the rest of us -
          and do. Ordinary Games is the grandstand for everyday miracles.
          <br />This is an inspirational book that shows how any one of us can
          transcend possibility or lighten life’s burdens simply by picking up a
          ball. It is a collection of poignant memoirs of games played without
          grandstands. Some of the stories relive everyday miracles, while
          others find the souls of players ascending into the spirits of the
          games they play. They tell of the glory, despair, and humanity that
          can be found any afternoon or evening, at any playground, gym, or
          empty field. <br />The tone is frequently humorous, but the tenor is
          deeply and genuinely human. While the primary themes involve
          overcoming impossible odds, secondary themes focus on overcoming
          common misperceptions. Throughout the narrative, these pieces explore
          racial and gender divides (including a history of violent separatism)
          with subtlety, grace, realization, respect, and the common language of
          competition. The vantage point is wholly familiar, yet new and fresh.
          My voice is that of a mediocre athlete who can hold his own (but to
          save his life cannot run fast), and whose sensibilities ignite when
          the game is on. This familiarity and intensity let readers watch and
          play at the same time, and hardly notice the difference. Something in
          each chapter has happened to them, too, and is worth remembering.

          “In these pages, Kirk Westphal gives us the essence of sports. He
          reminds us why we liked playing and watching sports in the first
          place. Anyone who has assembled a little Fenway out of their own
          backyard (the evergreen trees are the Green Monster and dad's car is
          the right field bullpen) will understand and love this book.”<br /><br />-
