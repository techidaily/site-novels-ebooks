            If you have bipolar disorder, you struggle with psychological
            balance, swinging between highly depressed and highly manic states.
            For you, finding the middle path can be a challenge, which is why
            the Tao understanding of energy can be so helpful. “Tao,” is a
            Chinese word meaning “the way” and a metaphysical concept for
            understanding the universe as a circular flow of energy. The Tao
            understanding of bipolar disorder is that symptoms are the result of
            a disrupted or imbalanced energy flow that can be brought back to
            harmony with dedication and practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            In The Tao of Bipolar, you will reconnect with your essential,
            stable, balanced nature, which, according to the Tao, is the
            inherent state of all matter. In the book, you will learn to manage
            your energy with meditation and other techniques so that you can
            always return to their stable center. While you may lose touch with
            the center during bipolar episodes, this book encourages you to use
            mindfulness and meditation to consciously shift your energy back to
            this center before a bipolar episode gets too extreme.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to bipolar disorder, managing emotions, preventing
            manic episodes, and dealing effectively with periods of depression
            is key to your mental health and well-being. This book will give you
            the tools you need to get your bipolar disorder under control, and
            get back to living life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you learn to manage your moods, you can function normally and
            experience far less suffering from the disorder, even when you do
            have bipolar episodes.

          “Throughout this helpful, holistic, clear, and cogent book the
          experienced authors skillfully depict both the bipolar condition and
          the many therapeutic ways its symptoms may be alleviated.
          Compassionately reassuring the sufferer, they encourage an attitude of
          non-judgmental awareness accomplished by meditation and breathing
          exercises to follow each day. . . . This book will be of great help to
          any who reads it and applies it to their lives.”<br />—<strong
