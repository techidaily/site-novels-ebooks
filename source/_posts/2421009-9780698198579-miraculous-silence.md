            >Regardless of where you are in life—whether you’re celebrating new
            beginnings, mourning a loss, weathering a hardship, or seeking
            inspiration—you will find this book of prayers to be the perfect
            companion.</b
          ><br /><br />
          At seventeen, Mitra Rahbar left her homeland due to political unrest.
          However, she would soon find her way in an unfamiliar land through an
          ever-deepening prayer life that led her to her soul’s core. Turning
          outward, she pursued a life of service—first as a social worker and
          then as a spiritual teacher, healer, and guide. Having worked with
          students from many walks of life for more than thirty years, Rahbar
          has a deep understanding of what spiritual seekers long to learn and
          how best to teach them.<br /><br />
          In <i>Miraculous Silence</i><b>,</b> she takes us on a journey into
          the sacred space of prayer and spiritual healing, providing practical
          guidance on how to pray and meditate, as well as many of her own
          prayers to inspire and encourage us. Rahbar also suggests images to
          visualize and meditate on, mantras to recite in every situation, and
          stones to aid in the healing process. In these practices, prayers, and
          inspirations, you will find comfort, illumination, and renewal.
