          If you were God for a day, what would you do? If you had to remember
          the moment in your life when you felt the most alone, when would it
          be? If you were to name one event that most challenged your
          relationship with your family, what would you say? If your soul was a
          color, which color would it be? If you learned that there actually was
          a Heaven and Hell, what is the first thing you'd change in your
          life?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
          ultimate task we face in life is the process of finding and accepting
          our true selves, our souls. It's often too scary, too overwhelming, or
          too time-consuming to begin the whole introspective process of
          self-discovery. So we often don't look. Instead, we do such things as
          work harder, spend money, eat and drink more, or maybe just clean the
          house. But what we forget--or maybe never knew--about soul-searching
          is that this process can be deeply rewarding, fun, and even
          entertaining. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
          their bestselling series of If . . . books, If . . . (Questions for
          the Game of Life), If2 . . . (More Questions for the Game of Life),
          and If3 . . . (Questions for the Game of Love), authors Evelyn
          McFarlane and James Saywell have reintroduced the power of the
          question. These "If . . . " questions have served as icebreakers,
          after-dinner games, and a platform for intensifying relationships with
          one's friends, lovers, and self. Now, in If . . . : Questions for the
          Soul, they present a phenomenal collection of questions that will help
          you begin your soul search. These questions will inspire and challenge
          you and guide you to a deeper understanding of your soul.
