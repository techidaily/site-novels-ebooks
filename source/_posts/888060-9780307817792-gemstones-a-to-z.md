          Legendary healer Diane Stein shares her extensive knowledge of
          gemstones in this concise agate-to-zircon reference. Each listing
          includes the stone's common name, its corresponding color and chakra,
          and a concise resume of its healing properties. Stein suggests ways to
          use stones to support physical and psychic well-being, by simply
          carrying one in a hand or pocket, wearing it as jewelry, or engaging
          in more advanced practices like the "laying on of stones." She also
          presents a glossary of terms designed for beginning students of
          metaphysical healing practices, and teaches how to clear, dedicate,
          and maintain crystals to maximize their beneficial effects.
          <br /><br />A quick reference to 550 gemstones and crystals (including
          many that are new to the marketplace), and their special healing
          properties and most helpful applications. Includes diagrams of the
          Kundalini (physical) and Hara Line (emotional) chakra healing systems
          for simplified cross-referencing with the stones. Diane Stein's books
          have sold more than half a million copies and are available in six
          languages.
