            >In this forty-fifth anniversary edition, a humble, one-armed Swiss
            farmer named Billy Meier documents his date with destiny with
            hundreds of photos, videos, and written conversations with
            extraterrestrial visitors from the Pleiades star cluster.
            <i>UFO…Contact from the Pleiades </i>offers the inside story of one
            of the most remarkable and convincing extraterrestrial encounters
            ever reported.</b
          ><br /><br />For the first time—forty-five years after their original
          publication—the two photo-journal volumes of
          <i>UFO…Contact from the Pleiades</i> are combined in one book for a
          modern audience, with a new foreword written by Shirley MacLaine, a
          prologue written by Mexican UFOlogist Jamie Maussan, and a new
          introduction and preface written by Brit Elders.<br />
          <br />
          This photo-journal presents the unique contact case of a Swiss farmer,
          Billy Meier, who claims to have met with the Pleiadians hundreds of
          times, compiling many layers of evidence including notes on their
          conversations, hundreds of photographs, movie footage, audio
          recordings of the craft, landing tracks of the spaceships, dozens of
          witnesses, and even metal samples of the craft itself. The quality and
          amount of evidence was convincing, making this unlike any case
          previously seen.<br />
          <br />
          <i>UFO…Contact from the Pleiades</i> takes the reader back to a time
          before home computers, digital photography, and easily accessible
          photo enhancement programs. Yet the evidence—analyzed in laboratories
          around the world—could not be easily dismissed, and supported the
          claims of the contactee, Billy Meier. The breathtaking images,
          profound words of the Pleiadians, and the extensive investigation that
          spanned seven years are as relevant today as they were forty-five
          years ago.

          "The 45th&nbsp;edition of
          <i>UFO... Contact from the Pleiades</i> should be part of any library
          archive in the serious study of contact and UFOs. One only needs to
          understand that in the 1970s we were given a pathway to evolution and
          a way to join the cosmic neighborhood. We are given this chance
          again."
