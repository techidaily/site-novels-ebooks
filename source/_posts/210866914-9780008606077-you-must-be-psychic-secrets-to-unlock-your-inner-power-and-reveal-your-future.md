            Have you ever felt as though you had a sixth sense, or had an
            experience you can’t quite explain? Or maybe you had a strange ‘gut
            feeling’ about a situation, and then it all came to fruition? These
            aren’t just coincidences, and in You Must Be Psychic, the UK’s
            favourite celebrity psychic, Chris Riley, talks you through the
            different aspects of the psychic gift and mediumship with tools and
            tips to tap into your abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Learn how to become more of an intuitive, how to connect to the
            spirit world, and how to protect your psychic ability from being
            taken advantage of by narcissists, energy vampires, and toxic
            personalities through Chris’ practical guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using accessible means such as meditation, tarot cards, and
            crystals, this book will help you learn how to better understand
            your abilities and what your future holds.

          A treasure trove of knowledge that must be read by those interested in
          awakening their psychic potential. This is your opportunity to be
          guided by a world-class psychic, Chris Riley. – &lt;b&gt;Claire Stone,
          spiritual author and award-winning psychic development
          expert&lt;/b&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris, who is a real-deal psychic super-talent – I bloody love him! –
          has generously shared all of his wisdom, skills and expertise (and
          secrets) to help you unlock &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; psychic powers. If
          you want to know how to connect with your Higher Self, what it means
          when you see 11.11, how to access your extra-sensory gifts or what
          crystal to use to attract luck, Chris, in his honest and relatable
          style, has written this book for &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;! –
          &lt;b&gt;Lisa Lister, author of &lt;i&gt;Witch&lt;/i&gt;,
          &lt;i&gt;Presence&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Code Red&lt;/i&gt; and
          &lt;i&gt;Self Source-ery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris' insight into the psychic world feels unique, fresh, genuine,
          comforting and full of hope. – &lt;b&gt;Naomi Channel, TV producer and
          host of true-crime podcast &lt;i&gt;Real&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          Chris' kindness is only paralleled by his accuracy and guidance. He
          cuts through so quickly and sharply with the kind of information even
          those closest to me haven't known. He has a true gift of sight, and I
          am lucky enough to have experienced it. – &lt;b&gt;Kat Graham,
          actress, &lt;i&gt;The Vampire Diaries&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a reading done by Chris and it was the most incredible
          experience I could ever have hoped for. He knew things nobody would
          have known, helped me have a clearer vision of my life's direction and
          left me feeling so comforted by connecting with my loved ones. I'm
          very grateful to Chris and I can't recommend him enough. Chris, you
          are amazing. – &lt;b&gt;Siannise Fudge, &lt;i&gt;Love Island
          UK,&lt;/i&gt; Season 6&lt;/b&gt;
