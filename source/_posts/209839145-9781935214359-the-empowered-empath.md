          If you're among the 1 in 20 people born as an "empath,"life's about to
          get a whole lot better...* Does being with certain people leave you
          physically drained?* Do you seem to soak up other people's emotions
          like a sponge?* Do you feel overshadowed by others, not sure who you
          really are?* Have you tried other advice for empaths to no avail?* Do
          you secretly worry there's something wrong with you? Life as an empath
          (someone who can experience another person's reality) can be
          wonderful. And confusing. While it can give you an edge in every arena
          of your life, for unskilled empaths, it can mean a bewildering tidal
          wave of unwanted, unwelcome and usually unconscious empath merges with
          other people's energy. And that's no fun. But...What if you could
          learn how to turn that connection offwhenever you wanted?That's the
          promise of The Empowered Empath. While both substantive and fun to
          read, don't let the lighthearted tone fool you: These are serious
          skills from the world's foremost expert at helping "born empaths"-Rose
          Rosetree. In this visionary work, Rosetree offers nothing less
          than:Simple, straightforward and proven techniques for consciously
          controlling your empath gifts-on command. And it gets better. Along
          the way, you'll discover that many "guru-prescribed" activities are,
          in fact, unnecessary, don't work, and -- if you understand what really
          makes an empath tick -- can't work. These include such busywork as:*
          Protecting yourself against "psychic vampires"* Using thoughts,
          feelings or behaviors to manage your sensitivity* Constantly trying to
          "clean up your energy field"* Doing grueling, ongoing work on your
          "boundaries"Instead, you'll discover a path that's far easier and more
          effective, and one that'll leave you with an enhanced sense of self,
          along with greater peace of mind, clarity, and personal power. Quit
          suffering and start living!Note: This is the full-length version of
          Rose's power-packed book for empaths. For a shorter edition, choose
