          One needs a very sympathetic ear and a very sympathetic heart to
          understand these beautiful parables, which are a rarity in Osho's work
          because they don't come from the talks that have made him so famous --
          the parables are actually written by him. Mystics like Buddha and
          Jesus talked in parables -- and in his book Osho provides us with
          sixty parables, anecdotes, and stories that speak directly to us --
          contemporary people of the modern age. These parables and their
          metaphors are all very simple, and because they are so simple they
          have a purity, they are unpolluted by complicated rationalizations of
          the modern mind. They are straightforward and direct, aimed to the
          heart like an arrow.<br /><br />In these parables Osho says in a
          poetic way things that cannot be said in prose. He is expressing
          things from the heart, things that cannot be expressed by the head.
          Each parable is a lesson to bring insights into one of the most
          important issues we face in life.<br /><br />As he points out, a
          parable is a way to talk in pictures and not in words. And in our
          dreams, we are again living in parables because the unconscious
          understands only pictures. Your conscious has become trained for
          language, words, but the unconscious is still that of a child.<br /><br />When
          a mystic like Osho wants to communicate something from his innermost
          depth to your innermost depth -- he uses parables. They function like
          a seed, hovering around the consciousness and emerging into sharp
          focus when our everyday life experiences bring an opportunity to apply
          their lessons. It is very easy to remember them.<br /><br />In the
          preface to this book, Osho writes: "What do I find when I look deeply
          into man? I find that man, too, is an earthen lamp! But he is not just
          a lamp made of clay; in him there is also a flame of light that is
          constantly rising towards the sun. Only his body is made of earth, his
          soul is that very flame."

        <p>
          <b>Osho</b> is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have
          influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.
          His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more
          and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around
          the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize
          the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to
          the issues we are facing today. The Sunday Times in London named Osho
          as one of the "1,000 Makers of the 20th Century". He is known around
          the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation - the
          science of inner transformation - with the unique approach of his
          "OSHO Active Meditations" acknowledging the accelerated pace of
          contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life.
