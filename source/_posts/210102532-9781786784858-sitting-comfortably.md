            >Sitting Comfortably is a guide to setting up your long-term healthy
            and enjoyable meditation practice. This is the only book offering a
            comprehensive approach to the preparation for sitting meditation
            without aches and pains.</b
          ><br /><br />Meditation practice can be blocked by aches and pains
          felt while sitting. This allows the jittery mind to take up residence,
          and leads to the feeling of "not being good at meditation".
          <br /><br />Sitting Comfortably explores the physical issues that may
          arise while sitting, from painful knees to tight hamstrings. Swami
          Saradananda shows how yoga preparation, breathing and adapting
          postures can help to strengthen the body to be able to maintain a
          sitting meditation. She invites us to understand how the mind can
          easily be distracted, like a puppy, and that physical discomfort can
          often be this distraction in disguise.<br /><br />This is the only
          book to focus on the physicality of a formal meditation practice.
          Helping prepare the body for the mindful practice of meditation, so
          that mind and body are in synchronicity. It will be an invaluable
          reference guide for students of mindfulness, yoga, Buddhism, as well
          as New Age traditions.<br /><br />The book is broken down into 8
          chapters, including: Overcoming obstacles to meditation; The art of
          sitting for meditation; Stretches/yoga poses that can help you sit
          comfortably; Breathing exercises (pranayama); Diet and lifestyle; Off
          your cushion and into the world. Beautifully illustrated throughout,
          this is the ultimate guide to preparing to meditate.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Swami Saradananda is an internationally renowned yoga and meditation
          teacher who has inspired thousands of people to practice. She has been
          teaching for almost forty years, and is the author of a number of
          books, including The Power of Breath, Chakra Meditation Relax and
          Unwind with Yoga, Yoga Mind and Body, The Essential Guide to Chakras
          and the upcoming Mudras for Modern Life. For 26 years, she worked with
          the International Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres and directed their
          facilities in New York, London, New Delhi and the Himalayas. After an
          extended period of personal practice in the Himalayas in 2001, she was
          author in residence at the Peacemaker Community in Western
          Massachusetts, and she then went on to direct yoga and meditation
          retreat Haus Yoga Vidya, just outside of Cologne, Germany. For the
          past few years, she has lived between London and New York but she
          spends several months each year teaching in Germany and several more
          in India. Swami Saradananda teaches yoga worldwide, leads pilgrimages
          to India and writes extensively. She is also a trustee of the Ganga
          Prem Hospice, a charity that is seeking to build a cancer hospice in
