            It was October 31, 1571, when Martin Luther disclosed his 95 thesis
            that began the Reformation and the birth Protestantism. It was one
            of many acts that launched a revolution of thought that spread
            across Europe and beyond.
          </p>
          <p>
            It had the inertia of the Renaissance to its back which was centered
            around social change and new concepts.

            Johannes Gutenberg's mechanical printing press allowed the dispersal
            of knowledge and information to cross all boundaries of country and
            all perspective of mind. At the beginning of the movement, the Bible
            was only available in Latin, Greek or Hebrew. In 1535, the first
            English translation was completed. The mass printing that took place
            opened the door to put God's words in the hands of every man, woman
            and child. No longer would the common person have to depend on the
            clergy for spiritual direction and guidance.

            This story is about those times and the influence the Reformation
            was having on every city, town and hamlet across all of Europe. Its
            influence inspired promise, possibilities and opportunities in all
            fields of life. The characters in this story are fictitious, but
            their witness to the events and times of the period are not. Their
            stories and the like still carry on to this day. They had the same
            desires, the same dreams, shrouded by a cloak of perception that was
            in a constant state of change and transformation.
          </p>

            Solomon claimed that there is a season and a time for every purpose
            under heaven. The Reformation was the season for change and forever
            a time for progress.

            Every sunrise offers a new opportunity for a change in direction, a
            change in heart, or a renewal of self. It's up to the observer to
            decide when and how the change will come about. To all it is given,
            and to all it shall always be.
