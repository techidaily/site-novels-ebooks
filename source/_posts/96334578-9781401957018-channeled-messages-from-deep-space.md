            ><i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Mike Dooley, one of
            today's most celebrated New Thought leaders, holds a conversation
            with a collective of intelligent beings--channeled by Tracy
            Farquhar--to shed light on a new era of expanded awareness and
            limitless possibilities.</b
          >
          <br /><br />How are we doing as a civilization? Why are societies so
          deeply divided? What happened to the many advanced cultures that
          preceded ours? Are there sentient beings visiting us from other
          planets, and if so, why haven't they made themselves known? Is there a
          God like the one we've been taught to believe in? And how far might
          spirituality take us, or does science hold the key to progress? We all
          ask questions like these not even expecting answers--but what if
          answers existed? Would we recognize the truth once uncovered?<br /><br />Enter
          Frank: a collective of eight beings from a distant planet who know
          what we're going through because they've been there too. Their
          civilization, once beset by many of the same challenges we face, has
          now advanced to a point where they can offer an informed and
          compassionate perspective on our trials, tribulations, and triumphs
          here on Earth. Speaking to Mike Dooley, one of today's most celebrated
          New Thought leaders, with medium Tracy Farquhar serving as their
          channel, Frank answers questions about:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Life
          on Brahoshka, from culture, technology, and education to leisure
          pursuits, food supply, relationships...
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Pressing earthly matters, from our
          political and social realities to the truth behind the Loch Ness
          Monster <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;The power of imagination,
          meditation, concentrated thought, divination, and prayer
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;The truth concerning angels, other
          dimensions, and what we can do to make a better world

          profoundly unique insights that can improve the world, one person at a

          you have ever thought that if you had only known then what you know
          now, your entire life would have been a far more peaceful and
          satisfying one, then you must read this beautifully channeled book of
          wise elders speaking to us from Deep Space who offer just this kind of
          wisdom. A fascinating, yet immensely practical love letter to we
          humans, this advanced group of beings collectively called ‘Frank’
          generously shares the wisdom they have acquired, having faced and
          transcended challenges similar to our own here on Earth. This book is
          clearly a timely gift to all, and leads to more peace for both
          ourselves and our planet. I couldn’t put it down.”<br /><b

          really smart ETs who live 3.6 billion light years away. And even more
          rare, it seems to me, to find they champion many of the same ideas as
          me: that being playful is the best expression of ourselves, that
          stretching boundaries and challenging well-worn systems is a high
          calling, and that imagination is our most potent superpower. They also
          picked one of my favorite people to deliver their life-changing
          message. Thank you, Mike, for being one of those artists, free
          thinkers, and anarchists (their words) who is open-minded enough to
          bring us these tectonic teachings.”<br /><b>— PAM GROUT</b>,
