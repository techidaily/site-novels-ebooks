          “Thich Nhat Hanh shows us the connection between personal inner peace
          and peace on earth.”<br />—<b>His Holiness the Dalai Lama</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh is a holy man, for he is humble
          and devout. He is a scholar of immense intellectual capacity. His
          ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to
          world brotherhood, to humanity.”<br />—<b
            >Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh’s work, on and off the page, has
          proven to be the antidote to our modern pain and sorrows. Here is a
          monumental, life-giving mind, preserved as textual force. And that's
          what I feel reading and practicing his teachings: that I am being
          acted on by a compassion equal to and pervasive as gravity
          itself.&nbsp;His books help me be more human, more&nbsp;me&nbsp;than I
          was before.”<br />—<b
            >Ocean Vuong, author of <i>On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</i></b

            >San Francisco Chronicle</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh is a great teacher. I have studied
          him, his work, his passage through life, with gratitude and joy.
          Through his writings, his public offerings, his insights, I’ve gained
          vision and clarity; I’ve often felt it would be impossible to find a
          more lucid, determined, and courageous soul.”<br />—<b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Thich Nhat Hanh was a world-renowned spiritual teacher and peace
          activist. Born in Vietnam in 1926, he became a Zen Buddhist monk at
          the age of sixteen. Over seven decades of teaching, he published more
          than 100 books, which have sold more than four million copies in the
          United States alone. Exiled from Vietnam in 1966 for promoting peace,
          his teachings on Buddhism as a path to social and political
          transformation are responsible for bringing the mindfulness movement
          to Western culture. He established the international Plum Village
          Community of Engaged Buddhism in France, now the largest Buddhist
          monastery in Europe and the heart of a growing community of
          mindfulness practice centers around the world. He passed away in 2022
          at the age of 95 at his root temple, Tu Hieu, in Hue, Vietnam.
