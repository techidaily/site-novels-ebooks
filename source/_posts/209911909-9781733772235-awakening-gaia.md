            Fred's first book, Spiritual Genomics&nbsp;explored how we can heal
            ourselves through mindfulness, sound healing, plant medicine and
            other modailities.&nbsp;In this lastest&nbsp;book published in
            December 2019, Fred takes you on a journey of planetary shamanism as
            he taps into higher-dimensional insights and flows with magical
            synchronicities to place lemurian crystals and sacred geometric
            forms around the world. These include the sacred ancient sites of
            Palenque, Rapa Nui, Chaco Canyon, and many others.&nbsp;His ultimate
            goal is to counter the darkness in our world by re-activating,
            re-connecting and radiating ancient healing energies and grids of
            the Native Americans, Maya, Incas, Egyptians, Polynesians and even
            more ancient civilizations. He invites you to resonate with this
            expanding field of energy, and encourages everyone to illuminate
            Gaia with their own light and love for their own health, and the
            sustainability of our planet. &nbsp;

          I wholeheartedly recommend Awakening Gaia to everyone who is looking
          to experience this elevated awareness with Gaia and walk on the
          empowered path of creating a world magical, compassionate and
          beneficial to all beings. Will you join him in this journey?

          I&nbsp;loved this book! &nbsp;Fred once again gives a grounded view of
          the magic that is unfolding as the Earth’s crystalline grid becomes
          re-activated. &nbsp;His eloquent insights remind us that we’re all
          guided by spirit and we are all part of&nbsp;the awakening of Gaia.
          The timing of this book couldn’t be better. You’ll find yourself
          smiling at each of his adventures, trusting that our world is in good
          hands…our hands.

          It is exciting to meet an old soul who has awakened…it’s even more
          exciting to witness this spiritual enlightenment in a medical
          doctor.&nbsp; His wonderful book shares his journey of his awakening
          and synchronicities which lead him to access ancient knowledge held in
          his DNA… with its roots beginning in Lemuria. He follows his heart,
          maintains pure intentions, and helps heal patients and Gaia in the
          way. I celebrate his journey and his story in this book. Synchronicity
          likely brought you to read this amazing book.
