          <b>Be an Instrument for Love</b><br /><br />Gabrielle says, "My
          commitment with this book is to wake up as many people as possible to
          their connection to faith and joy. In that connection, we can be
          guided to our true purpose: <b>to be love and spread love</b>. These
          words can no longer be cute buzz phrases that we merely post on social
          media. Rather, these words must be our mission. The happiness, safety,
          and security we long for lies in our commitment to love."<br /><br />When
          you follow this path, you’ll begin to feel a swell of energy move
          through you. You will find strength when you are down, synchronicity
          and support when you’re lost, safety in the face of uncertainty, and
          joy when you &nbsp;are otherwise in pain.<br /><br />Your energetic
          shift clears space for more miracles on a global scale. Not only will
          you experience massive abundance — you’ll help heal the world, too.<br /><b
