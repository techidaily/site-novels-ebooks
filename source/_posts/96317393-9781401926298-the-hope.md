            >Sacred Activism is compassion in action - the blending of physical
            work with spiritual intent to create a holy force and fusion of
            humankind's greatest achievements and principles.<br /></b
          ><br />With over thirty years' experience living a lifestyle that
          promotes change through compassion, including under the guidance of
          the renowned Tibetan adept Thuksey Rinpoche, Andrew Harvey explains
          how to combine the foundations of wisdom with the power of love in
          action to create a better world of meaning, empathy, strength and
          joy.<br /><br />The Hope will give the most practical possible help to
          all those who realise the urgent truth of our world - that these
          troubled times offer a gateway for dramatic and positive change - and
          who want to act as effectively as possible from wisdom and compassion.

          "Andrew Harvey is one of the most important teachers of our times for
          his extraordinary capacity to marry the deep mystical teachings of our
          essential unity with awakened action. Sacred Activism is the yoga of
          the now, it inspires and guides our way into the challenge of rebirth
          and great awakening. I will give and recommend <i>The Hope</i> to
          all!"<br />- <b>Shiva Rea</b>, Yogini, catalyst of the Global Mala
          Project and Dance for Life: Moving Activism to Plant 1,080,000 Trees
          with Trees for the Future.<br /><br />"As a fellow Sacred Activist, I
          support and applaud the dedication of Andrew Harvey to bridge the gap
          between spirituality and activism...<i>THE HOPE</i> is a must read for
          anyone seeking to birth a new humanity."<br />- <b>Deepak Chopra</b>,
          Author, <i>Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul</i
          ><br /><br />"If God created a new curriculum for the human race--one
          that might insure our continued<br />place on this planet--I think he
          would make <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i> required
          reading."<br /><b>-&nbsp;Elizabeth Lesser</b>, Co-Founder of Omega
          Institute &amp; author of <i>Broken Open</i><br /><br />"Sacred
          activism is the most potent after effect of our inner spiritual
          practices. When the heart explodes in conscious oneness with the
          Beloved, what remains is a burning desire to be a servant to the One
          that enlivens all sentient beings, every speck of space. Through his
          descriptions of the great lovers of humankind, Andrew gives us a
          clarion call to go beyond admiration to activation of that same
          capacity within our own hearts that we, too, may become a beneficial
          presence on the planet."<br />-&nbsp;<b>Michael Bernard Beckwith</b
          >,<b>&nbsp;</b>author of
          <i>Spiritual Liberation Fulfilling Your Soul's Potential</i
          ><br /><br />"Sacred Activism is a timely and desperately needed
          activist manifesto. It evolves what it truly means to be an activist
          in today's world and empowers us to model the change we seek. It's
          helped me bridge my activism and spiritual life like no other tool.
          Fellow activists: don't let the unexamined assumption that activism
          and spirituality don't mix stand in the way of you reading this book.
          The revolutionary message of Sacred Activism will empower you to reach
          a new level of effectiveness at producing results while simultaneously
          being more joyful, peaceful and fulfilled."<br />-

          <b>Caroline Myss</b>, Author of <i>Sacred Contracts </i>&amp;
          <i>Defy Gravity<br /></i><br />"This book takes one on a great journey
          through profound experiences of many, including the author Andrew
          Harvey. It engages each one of us in the most important inquiry for
          today's world: who am I in the emerging narrative, in creating new
          patterns for a world that works for everyone? It is about the
          compassion of our sacred space and the courage to create alternatives
          where needed."<br />- <b>Dr. Monica Sharma</b> Director, Leadership
