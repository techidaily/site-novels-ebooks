              >A practical, user-friendly guide for women seeking focus and calm
              in the midst of life's storms.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />Overwhelmed by the demands of family, work, and multiple
          responsibilities, many women find themselves feeling scattered, and
          distracted. In this eye-opening book, co-founder and CEO of the
          Mindsight Institute, Caroline Welch takes readers on a mindfulness
          journey to help them de-stress and cultivate inner peace. According to
          Welch, you do not need countless hours sitting in silence to be more
          present in your life--the key is to practice mindfulness wherever you
          are and whenever you can.<br /><br /><i>The Gift of Presence</i
          >&nbsp;guides readers in developing four innate capacities we all
          possess that will allow us to become more resilient and centered in
          our lives--even when life is throwing all that it has at us:<br /><br />Presence:
          the ability to remain firmly in the present moment; to be fully aware
          of what's happening as it's happening.<br /><br />Purpose: the
          personal meaning that gets us going and gives direction to our
          lives.<br /><br />Pivoting: an openness to change that allows you to
          switch direction if that is what is needed.<br /><br />Pacing: the
          awareness that it is impossible to do everything we want or need to do
          all at once; the ability to take life one step at a time.<br /><br />This
          life-changing book reveals that you already hold in your hands the
          keys to a more harmonious life--you simply need to look within.
