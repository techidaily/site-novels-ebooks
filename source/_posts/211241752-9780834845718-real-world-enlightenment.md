          Beloved mindfulness teacher, best-selling author, and longtime
          Buddhist practitioner Susan Kaiser Greenland explores time-honored
          themes that tap into the enduring sense of love, connection, and
          well-being that is with us regardless of our circumstances. These
          universal themes—including Change, Humility, Interdependence,
          Concentration, Joy, Kindness, and Discernment, among many others—help
          us find emotional and psychological freedom by lessening our
          reactivity, broadening our perspectives, and deepening our
          relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Drawing from science, psychology, Buddhism, wisdom traditions, and
          personal stories, Kaiser Greenland gives us strategies to shift from a
          narrow survival-driven frame of mind to one that is grounded and
          expansive. She offers valuable methods to apply these themes daily,
          including:<br /><br />
          Robust tools to manage stress and develop attention, like tapping into
          sensory pleasures or focusing on a single image or phrase.Catchy
          slogans that promote emotional balance when you feel overwhelmed, like
          “drop the baggage,” or “don’t play the scene before you get there.”
          These and other phrases can interrupt spiraling thoughts and move you
          back into your comfort zone.&nbsp;Accessible meditations to experience
          greater equanimity, slow down your thinking process, and heighten
          awareness of the natural movement of your mind.Time-tested life hacks
          to care for yourself and others with greater kindness and
          compassion.&nbsp;Strategies that bring greater ease and effortlessness
          into your life and relationships by helping you remain flexible and
          creative, even in challenging situations.And much more.&nbsp;

          “Susan Kaiser Greenland has improved the world immensely by bringing
          mindfulness to kids and parents at a time of escalating mental health
          challenges. Now she’s taking the concept of enlightenment, often
          shrouded in exotica and esoterica, and bringing it into the lives of
          regular people in doable and fascinating ways. Bravo.”<br />
          —<b>Dan Harris</b>, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of
          <i>10% Happier</i> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Real-World Enlightenment</i> is a beautiful book. In easily
          accessible, down-to-earth language, Susan Kaiser Greenland helps us
          appreciate that everyday glimpses of enlightenment are available right
          now. She shows us that it is about the small things we say and do each
          day. Sprinkled with compelling anecdotes and simple, easy-to-implement
          short practices, this book has something for everyone.”<br />
          —<b>Richard J. Davidson</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author

          “Susan Kaiser Greenland’s beautifully written new book ‘enlightens’ us
          as it masterfully weaves together personal stories; Buddhist practice
          and teachings; literary, cultural, and philosophical references;
          scientific research; and practical exercises. Susan’s gift, honed from
          years of teaching mindfulness to children, is her ability to take
          complex and even esoteric concepts and make them immensely relatable
          and accessible to us all. This book is thought-provoking, inspiring,
          and a joy to read.”<br />

          “Imagine the humility of an everyday sage who lives with the mortals
          among us and has the wisdom and clarity to share her hard-earned
          insights and deep, contemplative practice from ancient traditions—and
          to weave these with lessons from modern day science for us all to
          benefit from. This is the profound gift that Susan Kaiser Greenland

          the world that can transform a life of chaos and confusion to one of
          clarity and connection. This is a book to treasure on each reading, to
          keep on our bed stands for ready access each day, and to offer as a
          gift that keeps on giving to anyone we care about, including
          ourselves. Thank you, Susan, for such an important offering to the
          world during these challenging times for us all.”<br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          “This book offers a practical way to find what many of us are
          seeking—waking up to a reality that’s bigger than our limited
          self-perceptions. It draws on many spiritual traditions as well as
          personal stories to illustrate how enlightenment isn’t some mystical
          state to be found only in a cave. It’s a way of relating to each
          ordinary moment that can break us out of our usual way of seeing
          things and show us the beauty that’s already there.”<br />
          —<b>Kristin Neff</b>, author of <i>Self-Compassion</i><br />

          can I lead a more meaningful life?’ Weaving together Buddhist wisdom,
          literary insights, and personal anecdotes, Susan Kaiser Greenland
          takes enlightenment down from the pedestal and empowers us to find
          kindness and connection in the precious moments of our everyday life.
          With rich wisdom offered through approachable takeaways and practices,
          this book can serve as a cherished companion you can return to again
          and again on the path to freedom.”<br />

          <i>Real Life</i><br />
          <u> </u><br />
          “Inspiring, clear, and practical,

          everywhere looking to taste the fruits of spiritual practice in

          &nbsp;<br />
          “Every so often a book or teacher comes along that manages to be both
          simple and profound. In <i>Real-World Enlightenment</i>, Susan
          Kaiser-Greenland does just&nbsp;that, stripping the esoteric from the
          idea of enlightenment. The real world is heavy enough, and Susan
          Kaiser Greenland brings light and a playful energy to practice for
          anyone, anywhere, anytime.”<br />

          <i> </i><br />
          “Enlightenment for an everyday person like me? Susan Kaiser Greenland
          shows us that awakening can be found not only in a cave but in a
          kitchen. This much-needed set of beautifully written, relatable, and
          down-to-earth teachings helps those of us living in the real world
          learn how freedom is found right at home. If the Real Housewives of
          Buddhism had a book on their nightstand, it would be<i>
            Real-World Enlightenment</i
