          ><i
            ><b>The Map<br /></b><br /></i
          >Where are we going? How will we get there? In a world of uncertainty,
          most of us don’t really know. Our challenge is to sail into uncharted
          waters —away from the familiar ways that don’t work anymore —to
          discover ourselves and the infinite potential for our lives. It’s in
          these as-yet-undiscovered places within us that we come to recognize
          what we can be and what we can co-create with Spirit.<br />If we try
          to create guided only by the old, familiar map of our lives, what we
          create won’t be authentic to who we are becoming; we’ll just be doing
          the same thing over and over. As intuitive counselor and “spiritual
          cartographer” Colette Baron-Reid explains, we need a different kind of
          map —not one that tells us where we’ve been, but one we fill in as
          each new experience changes us into who we need to be to live our
          destiny. This new map is a map of the soul.<br />In <i>Uncharted</i>,
          you’ll learn to draw your own map of the soul as Colette guides you on
          an inward journey through five interconnected realms. First you’ll get
          oriented in the Realm of Spirit, your “home” that connects the other
          four. Then you will do the work of self-evolution and co-creation in
          the Realms of Mind, Light, Energy, and Form.<br />In the Realm of
          Mind, you experience your consciousness intermingled with that of all
          Consciousness. In the Realm of Light, you illuminate the darkness and
          experience transformation as you reclaim lost parts of yourself. In
          the Realm of Energy, you consciously direct the forces influencing
          you. In the Realm of Form, you see the results of your self-evolution
          manifested in the material world. At every step, you learn to harness
          your personal power and turn fear into possibility as you venture into
          the undiscovered places where magic happens.

          Baron-Reid is a rare and wonderful hybrid: she is both a wise teacher

          the depths of your ocean floor. Let Colette expertly support you, with
          her signature style of exercises and inquiry, to excavate your own

          were headed for big things. Not only is she brilliant, wise, and
          wholeheartedly connected to magic, but she knows, like few others,
          that spirituality is meant to be fun. Who else would call the bigger
          thing Quantum Fred, a title I delight in every time she playfully
          mentions it? Colette is privy to the fact that taking ourselves less
          seriously and playing around in the infinite field of possibility is
          the only real way to experience Truth. In this remarkable new book,
          she joins forces with Fred to deliver brand-new revelations. Pump your
          fists in the air, as I did when I read this book, and know you’re
          about to embark on the journey of a lifetime.”<br /><b>— Pam Grout</b
