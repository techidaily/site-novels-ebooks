            will take you by the hand and walk you step-by-step through the
            learning process as you discover how to:&nbsp; successfully learn
            and practice psychometry; accurately interpret your dreams; begin to
            understand and read the Tarot cards; safely conduct your own seance;
            practice effective candle magic; make your own amulets and

          <p>
            As an internationally known professional psychic John is frequently
            asked by his worldwide clientele, “How can I develop my own psychic
            abilities?”&nbsp; In response to those requests John has authored
            this book to help anyone to increase their own psychic powers, and
            to apply those powers in practical ways in order to better their
            lives and the lives of others.

          <p>
            The reader doesn’t have to have any psychic knowledge or training to
            be able to use this book right away.&nbsp; The complete beginner can
            begin with the first chapter and learn to practice psychometry
            successfully, and then proceed through the book and learn other
            exciting, entertaining, and useful techniques.&nbsp; And someone
            with above average psychic abilities and understanding may still
            find some useful theory and knowledge that they can apply, as well
            as new food for thought.

            From the foreword written by JV Johnson (Ghost Hunters TV
            show.&nbsp; Host — Paranormal IRL; Beyond Reality; The Independence
            Gang.&nbsp; publisher/editor of TAPS Para-magazine.):&nbsp; "In 20
            Ways to Increase Your Psychic Abilities, John offers the same
            guidance for any who look to broaden their spectrum of
            understanding. John presents a straightforward and eye-opening
            approach to unleashing your psychic potential. As he says, '…like
            all things, practice and consistency is key.'&nbsp; You will find
            him to be an inspiration as I have for the years I have known him.
            And, even though you may not have the chance to meet John
            personally, through his books and his words, you will find in him,
            as I did, a true friend."&nbsp; JV Johnson.
