            >An inspirational memoir of one man’s transformation after being
            near-death and witnessing the selfless acts of others.</b
          ><br /><br />One day, while leaving a routine doctor’s appointment,
          Kevin asks his doctor a simple question that later proves to save,
          extend, and profoundly change his life—a question he believes is
          divinely inspired. <i>Life 2.0</i> follows Kevin’s journey through
          open-heart surgery and recovery. But, more than that, this is the
          story of the impact little things can have when people open their
          hearts.<br /><br />As Kevin journeys through recovery and
          rehabilitation, he starts to notice the selfless little things others
          do—and develops a new perspective on life. Coupled with encounters
          with Angels, Kevin’s new life is molded into a life of profound
          physical, emotional, and spiritual change, and he decided to call it
          Life 2.0. An inspiration for healthcare providers, patients, and their
          families, <i>Life 2.0</i> demonstrates how the little things can
          profoundly impact the lives of others and how anyone, if they so
          choose, can live their own Life 2.0.<br /><br /><b
            >“Kevin has not only redefined the world around him, but his ability
            to inspire and motivate others in the path of happiness and
            faith-filled living is remarkable! His love for family and care for
            all those who meet him have inspired me to be a better version of
            myself&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. imagine the world if we all rejoiced as
            Kevin does in <i>Life 2.0</i>.” —Susan K. Moats, DNP, MBA, RN, NEA,
            BC, Chief Nursing Officer, Vice President of Patient Care
            Services</b
