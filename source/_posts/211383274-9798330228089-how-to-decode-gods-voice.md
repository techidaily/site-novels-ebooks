          <p>
            So friends, we're looking at how to decode God's voice. There are
            various ways God speaks to us. The text we'll be looking at today is
            1 Samuel chapter 3. But just on an introductory term, it is possible
            you're already hearing God. The issue is either you're not attentive
            or you don't understand when He speaks or you've not been taught on
            how to be able to decode what He's saying.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And so in this short exhortation, I would like us to look at the
            five ways God speaks to us. Five ways. And they are by audible
            voice, by revelation and revelations broken down into visions,
            trances and dreams. By inward witnessing, that is number three.
            Number four, by prophecies or word of knowledge. And number five, by
            the written word.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            But there might be more of other ways because God can use anything
            to speak to us. You know, so He uses various ways and means to
            communicate to us. Like the backslidden prophet, Balaam, that He
            used the donkey to speak to him after warning him not to go to curse
            the children of Israel. He insisted on going and God told him to go
            ahead under a permissive will scenario. You can read that story in
            Number 22:21-39.
          </p>
          <p>
            And on the way, his donkey began to speak to him when he began to
            flog the donkey. The donkey received the human voice and began to
            speak to him. And there was an angel that was right there in front
            of them with a sword Ô∏è drawn to strike Balaam, the backslidden
            prophet.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And so we don't want to put God in a box, but there are these five
            ways that God speaks most of the time. And so we want to look at
            them one after the other, so the five of them. Now, before I go on,
            you understand that as you go through scripture, you see even in the
            garden of Eden, God coming down in the cool of the day and
            discussing with the humans, that is Adam and Eve, and taking a
            walking with them, spirit to spirit. And so we see that. We see how
            he came down to warn Cain, he should be careful because evil was
            planned against him and he must master it. So he doesn't go ahead
            and kill his brother, he was warned ahead of time. And then when he
            carried out that the intent of his heart, driven by hatred, God came
            and discussed with him, "Where is your brother?" and cain responded,
            "Am I my brother's keeper?" that is God talking to man and man
            talking back to God. That account is in Genesis 4.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And we go on and on where Enoch walk with God and was not for God
            took him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we go down to Noah, the first flood that filled the earth. We
            see there that Noah got specific instruction and the design of the
            ark. And so there was an ongoing back-to-back communication with
            specifics on what needs to be done, the measurement, the dimensions,
            the heights, the width, and all of that, the number of animals that
            should go in and all of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            And he continued and continued. We go to Abraham where God called
            Abraham to leave his country. He spoke to him. It wasn't a foreign
            thing. It wasn't something that is rare for God not to speak to
            human. God spoke to one of the kings that wanted to take over
            Abraham's wife and dealt with them in Egypt. That was Pharaoh. They
            were able to tell who spoke to them. In Egypt, that happened. And
            then in Philistines, the king of the Philistines, Abimelech, God
            also spoke to him in a dream. And there was an engagement going in
            the dream. Can you beat that? This is somebody who doesn't have any
            relationship with God and God was speaking to him. So we go on and
            on and on and on.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            We have scenarios where He spoke to Paul. Paul was on his way to
            arrest Christians, to imprison, to kill. He was a sinner,
            essentially with godly zeal. But God interrupted that trip and was
            able to stop him and make him blind. He heard everything.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And in our day and age, God is still speaking. And so I want to look
            at the audible voice.
