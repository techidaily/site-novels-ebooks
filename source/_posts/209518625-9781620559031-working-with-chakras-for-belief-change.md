          An easy-to-use therapy tool for transforming unhelpful belief patterns
          and envisioning positive change <br /><br />• Identifies 28 beliefs
          per chakra that can be energetically realigned using the Healing
          InSight Method <br /><br />• Offers a tool set of therapeutic
          processes, affirmations, visualization, and bodywork for the practical
          application of the transformational belief realignment method
          <br /><br />• Includes 56 full-color, high-vibration chakra images,
          one for each main chakra as well as 7 additional empowering images for
          each chakra <br /><br />• Paperback with lay flat binding
          <br /><br /><i>Working with Chakras for Belief Change</i> transforms
          people’s unhelpful beliefs through clearing their chakras, raising
          their vibrations, and creating a fertile space for the New to come in.
          The Healing InSight Method presented in this practical full-color book
          is based on affirmations used together with individual chakra work and
          specific bodywork exercises, including techniques drawn from
          kinesiology, qigong, whole-brain integration, visualization, and
          infinity symbol exercises. Psychologist and energy therapist Nikki
          Gresham-Record channeled 28 common beliefs for each chakra, 196 total,
          which can be fully realigned using this transformational system of
          complete mind-body-spirit healing. The author organizes the beliefs
          around the chakra system and explains how unhealthy beliefs can take
          root within the chakras and the body. She shows how her belief
          realignment method is capable of changing beliefs and their associated
          vibrations in the subconscious mind and energy body, thus enabling any
          blocks to dissolve and your system to open up to the opportunity for
          change. <br /><br />The 56 high-vibration chakra images included in
          this book can be used as a tool for therapeutic guidance as well as
          for positive manifestation. Each chakra is represented by a main
          chakra image along with 7 chakra aspect images, affirming potent
          qualities that we are all able to access when balanced and in harmony
          within ourselves. The artistry of the chakra images offers an
          immersion in the vibration of the empowering chakra-related beliefs
          and aids energetic resonance to help people feel good and begin
          healing. Also offering case studies and a life-review process to help
          the reader take stock of their situation before and after they begin
          the Healing InSight Method,
          <i>Working with Chakras for Belief Change</i> provides a gentle,
          energetic, yet potentially life-changing tool for personal growth and
          development.

          "What a miracle worker this 304 page labor of love is. I was
          completely woke up by the idea of healing ones belief systems through
          the chakras. I am well aware that disease has so much to do with the
          beliefs and resulting actions we hold. The method is simple and easy
          to follow and I loved the pictures throughout. The message was loud
          and clear as we change our thoughts we change our energy and we heal.
          I truly would recommend my new best friend to anyone wanting a
          healthier way to be and a gentle way to get there. Thanks Nikki, I so
          get this."
