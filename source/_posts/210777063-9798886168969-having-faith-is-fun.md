            Having faith is fun, and it really is just that--fun! When you
            realize that faith has all the answers to your situation, why would
            you live in fear? When you live in fear, your fear is your faith,
            and you believe what fear says. We have all been given a measure of
            faith not to hold on to but to use. Faith is an action word, which
            requires action to reap the rewards of answered prayers of those
            things hoped for. Believing when we pray powers our faith. In the
            book of James, he reminds us that "faith without works is dead"
            (James 2:20 KJV). As time goes by, our measure of faith, which we
            should be using whether it's the mustard seed or something greater,
            would grow over time into a mustard tree (Matthew 21:34-37). No one
            should have the same measure of faith they were given at birth.
            Babies don't know anything about faith, but there is a mechanism in
            place that when a baby cries, attention comes. It's the same with
            our faith: when it is used, it brings God's attention to our
            situation. So as you see, having faith is fun. Faith already has the
            answer to whatever you're going through. Try having fun with faith,
            and you'll see and notice the difference in your trials. Let go of
            fear and grab your faith because having faith is fun when you use it
            and believe it!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            What I noticed is the power that faith produces from one trial to
            another. Faith grows. It should not be the same faith you used when
            you were younger. Faith doesn't stay the same. It changes, it grows.
            It is sad when I hear someone say, "I have mustard seed faith after
            going through many trials." Faith is a seed that is meant to grow
            bigger and better with every trial. Faith makes you a winner. Real
            faith never fails. Make faith your friend and fear your enemy. You
            will see the difference in the results.
