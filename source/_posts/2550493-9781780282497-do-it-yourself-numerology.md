          The previous edition of this practical guide sold more than 100,000
          copiesâ€”and it still provides the best hands-on introduction to
          numerology available. Based on your birth date, this age-old science
          can reveal essential information about your work, relationships,
          health, life, even your looks. Discover the essential significance of
          the Personality Numbers 1 to 31 (rather than the 1 to 9 of most
          books), and the strengths, challenges, physical traits, and childhood
          influences associated with each number. Do simple calculations to
          figure out Master, Collective, and Personal Year numbers, which
          enhance intuition and self-understanding. And of course, examine the
          numbers of friends and family to gain extraordinary insight into their
          personalities and propensities, too! Starting with a simple formula
          for determining your personality number (based on the date on which
          you were born), this book reveals the keys to career, relationships,
          and health. Among the fascinating information you will learn is the
          significance of the personality numbers; the influence of numerology
          on health, romance, and childhood issues; and personality profiles of
          famous people through the ages.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Sonia Ducie Dip.CSN.AIN. is a teacher at The Connaissance School of
          Numerology and a member of the Association Internationale De
          Numerologues. She has been a professional Numerologist for more than
          23 years and has written 12 books, which have been translated into 13
          languages, including Numerology: Your Personal Guide to Life (2007)
          and Do It Yourself Numerology (2009). With a background in journalism
          and an early fascination for science and mathematics, she was drawn
          from a young age to the intuitive, transformational and metaphysical
          aspects of Numerology. Over the years, she has worked not only with
          many individuals but also with many businesses to enhance their
          growth, success and satisfaction from the inside out. Every day
          numbers reveal more of the unseen to her, and add to her sense of
          compassion for and understanding of the universe. She lives every day
          in awe of the journey of our soul and humanity as explored through
          number, and she is passionate about sharing this with others, whether
          newcomers to the field or people who already know some and would like
          to know more.
