          A fully illustrated inspirational art book from visionary painter
          Francene Hart<br /><br />• Includes more than 80 full-color
          reproductions of Hart’s intricate watercolor paintings and the stories
          behind them<br /><br />• Recounts the evolution of her art and her
          discovery of the hidden order of Nature that led to her masterful
          artistic integrations of Nature, Spirit, and Sacred Geometry<br /><br />•
          Explores how to tap into the energies provided by spirit guides and
          power animals, like Jaguar, Raven, Octopus, and Dolphin, and harness
          the intelligence of the heart for creative inspiration and vision<br /><br />Every
          one of us possesses the potential to receive visionary experiences and
          integrate them into our lives. Artists become visionaries by
          cultivating their instinctive creative spark and sharing their
          profound visions with the world.<br /><br />In this lavishly
          illustrated memoir, including more than 80 full-color reproductions of
          her intricate watercolor paintings and the stories behind them,
          Francene Hart recounts the evolution of her art from formative
          influences to her masterful integrations of Nature, Spirit, and Sacred
          Geometry. Opening with her early work on mandalas and her explorations
          of the work of Joseph Campbell and C. G. Jung, Hart explains how her
          first works of art were in response to the solitary life she led in
          the forest, where she discovered the hidden order of Nature. She
          reveals how she learned to center her artistic explorations on the
          intelligence of the heart rather than the intellect, utilizing the
          wisdom and imagery of Sacred Geometry, reverence for the natural
          environment, and the interconnectedness between all things as her
          inspirations. She describes the shamanic lessons that accompanied her
          discoveries and shaped her understanding of sacred relationships with
          the self, others, and Mother Earth. She explores how to tap into the
          energies provided by spirit guides and power animals, like Jaguar,
          Raven, Octopus, and Dolphin, and explains her profound affinity for
          the ocean, including her discovery of water consciousness in Hawaii.
          Offering chronicles of her inspiring travels and transformational
          encounters around the world, Hart shares her experiences at sacred
          sites in the Amazon, Central America, Egypt, England, Scotland, Paris,
          Cambodia, and the Himalayas and how these places influenced her
          art.<br /><br />Exploring what is revealed as inspiration arises,
          Spirit informs, and vision is transformed into art, Francene Hart’s
          journey offers a window into the secret order of Nature, the power of
          sacred symbols for evolving consciousness, and a visionary artistic
          path that perfectly blends the mathematical rigors of sacred geometry
          and the numinous.
