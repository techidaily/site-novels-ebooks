          "From the very first line, to the very last sentence I was so engulfed
          in this fantastic book that I spent the better half of three days
          reading. It was captivating, flowed perfectly and was written in a way
          that all readers could truly appreciate its value and teachings. I for
          one learned a great deal and encourage those who are reading this
          review to invest in this book. You will simply not be able to put it
          down. I guarantee that "Unleash Your Psychic Power," will not only be
          epic for you, it will also be a classic read that you will be able to
          enjoy over and over." ~&nbsp;Lazaro

          "I have always believed that there is something more to life and us
          humans than what is simply set in front of us. I also believe that
          each and every one of us has powers that we just do not have the
          understanding to tap into just yet. So, it was truly amazing to met
          hat the VERY FIRST line in this book pretty much verified what I've
          been thinking and I can tell you from then on...I was hooked. This
          book, while of 350+ pages in length, is absolutely awesome. Teaching
          others to think outside of the box and to look at things from other
          perspectivesis a very hard thing to do, and is the basic ground work
          for rebuilding a persons sense of beliefs on what is, and isn't,&nbsp;
          &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          possible....this book does all of this and much, much more!" ~

          "Along with information on auras, channeling and animal whispering it
          contains just about every psychic and paranormal topic you can think
          of. The section on Ki energy was excellent. The author really over
          delivers in material and it is a nice change from books with hardly
          any info."&nbsp; ~ Diana L.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The author shows a skill for weaving words and explaining the
          intricacies of the wealth of psychic realms, managing to introduce me
          to all the many psychic areas a person could become proficient in...
          and then he showed me how to begin my journey of uncovering my own
          talents in the psychic world. From a reader's standpoint, the book is
          filled with countless insights into psychic powers/abilities as well
          as a deeper understanding of how to train your mind/body to become in
          tune with the psychic world."&nbsp; ~ L. Collins

          "A welcome relief. I was a little skeptical about the validity of the
          contents of this book . . . UNTIL I read it. Being a paranormal
          researcher myself, and up-to-date on psychic phenomena, the ins and
          outs, the dos and don'ts, and all the scams in-between, I was ready
          for a none too favorable review. How nice to be disappointed!
          &nbsp;This impressive book is very well written; and remarkably - it
          iscomprehensive without being boring. I strongly suggest that you read
          it from cover to cover BEFORE delving into the supernatural world of
          Psychic Power - from Channeling to Psychic Self Defense, and Telepathy
          to my personal favorite- Lucid Dreams."&nbsp; ~ Lyn Murray
