          The only thing greater than fear is hope Frustrations with jobs and
          employers, mortgages and car repairs, college debt and marital
          conflict make us so overwhelmed we cant even sleep. And thanks to
          wonderful drug advertising, very few of us are not on some sort of
          toxic substance to either help rest our minds at night or cope with
          stress during the day. Ask yourself if this is not true. People are
          taking their own life over this stuff, which makes me wonder if weve
          missed out on some secret. When wounded souls feel they have no other
          option but to remove themselves from this earth before their time, wed
          better start uncovering some hope, and soon. Lets be honest. Our world
          is broken. We patch it up with all sorts of things, but underneath,
          where we really live, there is everything from anger, regret, lust,
          despair, and pain to fear, guilt, depression, greed, and
          unforgiveness. We are bombarded with distraction, deception, and way
          too much self-absorption to even recognize truth anymore. Is there any
          way out of this mess? Yes! There is indeed. It is found in one person,
          who gave everything to rescue us. His name is Jesus. The Prized
          Possession will help you discover who Jesus really is and why He is
          the only hope for hurting hearts. You will see why self-absorption and
          self-reliance are highly overrated, and how they keep us far from the
          freedom we need to see beyond our circumstances. Within these pages
          are true, personal stories sure to inspire your heart and stretch your
          understanding of God and His unrivaled love for humanity. If you have
          questions about life, come along on an exciting journey toward hope,
          purpose, and redemption. There is a very generous God just waiting for
          you.
