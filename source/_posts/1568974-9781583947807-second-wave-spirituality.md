          In his work as a spiritual teacher interacting with seekers and
          activists from around the world, Chris Saade has witnessed a
          remarkable recent phenomenon: an emerging wave of spirituality that is
          socially and globally engaged in the pursuit of justice, earth care,
          and solidarity. Saade calls this movement "second wave spirituality,"
          and in this book he maps out the cutting-edge ideas that are fueling
          this burgeoning wave of engaged spirituality. He challenges us to rise
          to our spiritual task and join the millions of all faiths who are
          awakening to the suffering and social struggles of all living beings.
          <br /><br />According to Saade, second wave spirituality holds a
          vision of the intrinsic values of love: justice, global peace,
          solidarity, inclusion, democratic freedom, compassion, and
          reconciliation. Saade explores current trends of thought that are
          shaking the foundations of our belief systems and propelling us toward
          an evolutionary leap. We are in the midst of a spiritual renaissance,
          Saade asserts, a universal reawakening that will steer us away from
          the abysmal global dangers we are facing.<br /><br />The book also
          includes a collection of quotations as a resource for those working
          for peace, justice, and inclusion. By dividing the selections into
          theme-specific chapters, Saade helps us easily access the wisdom and
          companionship of other souls committed to our diversity, our oneness,
          and our pursuit of justice.<br /><br />Contents<br />Foreword by
