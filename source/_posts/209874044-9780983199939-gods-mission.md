          Spiritual warfare might be scary to some people. It involves fighting
          and overcoming evil and demonic forces sent against you by someone
          skilled in satanic crafts. Sometimes, it is Satan challenging you in
          the anointing God placed on your life. The reality of spiritual
          warfare comes alive in this book, as the author relates her
          experiences. When faced with spiritual warfare, ready or not, you must
          deal with it. The reality of spiritual warfare comes alive in this
          book, as the author relates her experiences. God gave her and her
          family dreams to prepare them for her experiences. She can now help
          others fight their spiritual battles, overcome forces of darkness, and
          reject the Biblical "mark of the beast."It might seem strange for
          someone to speak of being attacked by evil and demonic spirits. You
          will most likely be labeled as being crazy, if you dare to share your
          experiences. However, if you only take the time to search the Bible,
          you will find many stories of Jesus casting out evil and demonic
          spirits from people who were sickened in one way or the other by them.
          Even Jesus' disciples were able to cast them out in Jesus' name after
          He gave them the power to do so. It was a sad day for earth when Satan
          and his angels were cast out of Heaven. Adam and Eve were the first to
          fall into Satan's trap. Satan and his angels are the powers by which
          people inflict injuries on others, spiritually. The Bible tells of
          people working curious arts (satanic crafts), which were documented in
          books (Acts 19:19); so, it continues in our days. People skilled in
          satanic crafts are inflicting injuries on others, through spiritual
          means. The author is a victim of such spiritual wickedness. This book
          is about God taking her through His mission of battling evil and
          demonic spirits and conquering them. For the author, spiritual
          wickedness was discovered to be contributing to what was thought to be
          an all-natural illness, resulting from a car accident. She has been
          through experiences of outright spiritual battles with the Trinity
          (God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit) providing help throughout her
          ordeals. She was exposed to different levels of evil spirits and
          demons and had the revelation of how to handle the Biblical "mark of
          the beast" - 666.
