              >“Written in the form of 200 meditations . . . aimed at those
              enmeshed in other people’s problems . . . [Casey] acts as a sister
              in the process of recovery.” —<i>Library Journal</i></b
            ><br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Do you ever feel like you might be giving other people too much
            power over your mood? Do you find yourself feeling immobilized by
            expectations and demands? The cure for facing codependence, says
            Karen Casey, is detachment.<br /><br />
            Control your life&nbsp;by letting go. When we remove codependent
            behavior from our lives, we discover a life of balance and freedom.
            Whether you find yourself tempted to become enmeshed in other
            people’s problems or rushing to their rescue, Casey reminds us to
            stop controlling behavior—that we cannot control anyone or anything
            beyond ourselves.<br /><br />
            What is codependency&nbsp;and detachment?&nbsp;Inside, you’ll find
            gems of insight for every stage of your codependence recovery
            journey. Through 200 recovery meditations and
            reflections,&nbsp;Casey explores how to set boundaries, control
            emotions, face attachment issues in adults, and more. Inspirational
            and easy to read,&nbsp;<i>Let Go Now</i>&nbsp;guides us away from
            taking care of others, and toward taking care of ourselves.<br /><br />
            If you’re looking for a codependent book or an attachment book —like
            Melody Beattie books,&nbsp;<i>The Power of Letting Go</i>,<i
              >Codependent No More,</i
            >&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>The Language of Letting Go</i>—you’ll love&nbsp;<i

              >“A cornerstone concept of both Eastern philosophy and Twelve Step
              programs . . . Casey elegantly brings this time-honored term into
              everyday situations so that it can become a true, user-friendly
              tool for recovery.” —Tian Dayton, PhD, author of&nbsp;<i

          “Karen Casey teaches us how to row our boat (note: not other people’s
          boats) gently down the stream. When we row gently, we don’t yell who
          or what must be on the bank around the bend. We peacefully accept what
          comes and this makes us very merry. We quietly bless the people who
          are there, knowing that is exactly where they should be. We let go and
          allow the River to carry us home, certain that the River is our
          God-given will, our safety, our comfort, and our peace.
          <i>Let Go Now</i> is one of the most profoundly spiritual and helpful
          books I have read.”<br />
          —Hugh Prather, author of <i>Morning Notes</i> and
          <i>The Little Book of Letting Go</i>

          “You just can’t go wrong with Karen Casey. In <i>Let Go Now</i> she
          steers a course though the at-times confusing waters of detachment.
          She takes the reader though 200 little classes explaining what
          detachment is and what it is not. This book would help anyone trying
          to live a life as serene yet productive as possible in this often busy
          time.”<br />
          —Earnie Larsen, author of
          <i>Stage II Recovery: Life Beyond Addiction</i> and

          “A cornerstone concept of both Eastern philosophy and Twelve Step
          programs, detachment is often misunderstood and misapplied. In
          <i>Let Go Now</i> Karen Casey elegantly brings this time-honored term
          into everyday situations so that it can become a true, userfriendly
          tool for recovery. She not only tells us what detachment means, she
          shows us how to do it, one day at a time.”<br />

        <p>
          “Casey has given us a wonderful guidebook for one of life’s ongoing
          challenges —detachment —so essential to our spiritual health. No one
          with a caring heart would want to miss this essential read. Another
          winner for Karen Casey and thus for all of us!” <br />

          “My measure of a book’s worth: 1. Does it open a window in my mind? 2.
          Do I change? 3. Is my life improved? The answer? Yes on all counts for
          <i>Let Go Now</i>.”<br />
