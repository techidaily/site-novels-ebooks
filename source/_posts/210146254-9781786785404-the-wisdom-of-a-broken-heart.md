            ><b>We’ll all </b>experience emotional pain in our lives—but the
            secret teachings of Jesus and Mary Magdalene show us how adversity

            >A beautiful guide to self-care, told in verse, by
            <b>renowned mystic and spiritual teacher Lars Muhl</b></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In a time when we are challenged in many ways, Lars Muhl stresses that
          it’s through the pain suffered by so many of us—and by understanding
          its deeper meaning—that we are given a unique opportunity for a
          breakthrough at the spiritual plane.<br /><br />
          Arranged in verse form, this beautiful gift book contains the essence
          of the secret teachings taught by Yeshua (Jesus) the Nazarene and
          Mariam (Mary) Magdalene 2,000 years ago. Over the years, these
          teachings have been revealed in fragments and scattered glimpses. Now,
          Muhl&nbsp;creates a synthesis of the beautiful wisdom of the complete
          human being. Topics range from the profound energetic exchange that
          occurs between two lovers to using mantras, song, and dance in order
          to reach divine awareness; to numerology and other symbolism.
          Ultimately, this is a complete guide to living the Law of Light for
          the benefit of yourself and the wider world.<br /><br />
          As Lars says: “We are all potential healers, and if there is anything
          the world needs right now, it is exactly healers.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          Lars Muhl is a Danish author, mystic and musician. Like Paulo Coelho,
          he was for many years a successful singer/songwriter who, concurrently
          with his music, studied esoteric knowledge. Then in 1996, he was
          struck down by an unexplained illness that neither doctors nor
          alternative therapists could diagnose. For three years he lay in bed
          without being able to move or think straight. Through a close friend's
          intervention, Lars was put in touch with a seer who, via the
          telephone, brought him back to life. That was the start of a
          completely new existence and the beginning of that quest he has so
          grippingly described in his trilogy The O Manuscript.
