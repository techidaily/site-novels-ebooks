            >“Paxson provides songs, rituals, magical exercises, and practical
            advice to help you develop your own personal relationship with the
            Lord of Runes.” —Judika Illes, author of
            <i>Encyclopedia of 5,000 Spells</i></b
          ><br /><br />Odin is arguably one of the most enigmatic and complex
          characters in Norse mythology. Revered since the Viking Age, Odin has
          been called the greatest of the gods—the god of words and wisdom,
          runes and magic, a transformer of consciousness, and a trickster who
          teaches truth. He is both war god and poetry god, and he is the Lord
          of Ravens, the All- Father, and the rune master.<br /><br /><i
            >Odin: Ecstasy, Runes, and Norse Magic</i
          >
          is the first book on Odin that is both historically sourced and
          accessible to a general audience. It explores Odin’s origins, his
          appearances in sagas, old magic spells, and the Poetic Edda, and his
          influence on modern media, such as Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings
          trilogy. Each chapter features suggestions for rituals, exercises, and
          music, so readers can comprehend and become closer to this complicated
          god.<br /><br />Author Diana Paxson, an expert on Viking-era
          mythology, provides a complete portrait of Odin and draws on both
          scholarship and experience to provide context, resources, and guidance
          for those who are drawn to work with the Master of Ecstasy today.<br /><br />“This
          remarkable book is at times ribald and reverent, worldwise and
          innocent, pragmatic and idealistic, as needed to masterfully show the
          ways of a very complex God.” —Ivo Domiguez, Jr, author of
          <i>Keys to Perception</i>

          "It was said in the lore and legends of Norse mythology that people
          who got interested in Odin, the god of hunters, warriors and oracular
          seers were "seized" by this deity, fascinated by this multifarious
          character. Diana Paxson, author of historical novels and short stories
          on themes from Norse and Celtic mythology was clearly seized, somewhat
          to her own surprise. She here beautifully re-tells some classic
          stories from this mythic complex and relates how they are reflected in
          the ceremonial practices of the contemporary Neo-Pagan revival. I
          recommend it highly."<br /><br />"Reading Diana Paxson's most
          excellent book, Odin: Ecstasy, Runes, and Norse Magic, whilst
          listening to WardRuna. This is perhaps the most comprehensive book
          ever written about Odin. Written with sound scholarship allied to
          intuitive perception. Capturing the best of both, and a sense of
          humour to boot. Each chapter is ended by a list of suggestions for
          working with him. Apart from the scholarship and poetic vision, it is
          also a most pleasant read! Recommended for everyone interested in
          Odin. Very, very helpful to students, but also rich in details and
          associations from other good books. which are listed in the
          bibliography! All in all, a very worthwhile work and as such equally
          useful to Old Timers like me."<br /><br />"Odin: Ecstasy, Runes, and
          Norse Magic is a journey through personal histories of encounters with
          Odin, a weaving of old lore and modern thought, and a guide to
          practices that deepen your connection to his mysteries. Even if you
          don't work with Odin or this pantheon, this book is a treasure house
          of ideas for anyone who is serious about working with Goddesses and
          Gods. Moreover, there are people that are dear to me that work with
          Odin and this book has given me insight into the whys and wherefores
          of their spiritual path. This remarkable book is at times ribald and
          reverent, worldwise and innocent, pragmatic and idealistic, as needed
          to masterfully show the ways of a very complex God."
