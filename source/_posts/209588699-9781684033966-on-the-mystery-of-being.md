        </h4>

          <b>Zaya Benazzo</b> is a filmmaker from Bulgaria with degrees in
          engineering, environmental science, and film. For many years, she
          worked as an environmental activist in Holland and Bulgaria, and later
          produced and directed several award-winning documentaries in Europe
          and the United States.<br /><br /><b>Maurizio Benazzo</b> grew up in
          Italy, and in 1984 came to the United States on a
          ninety-eight-year-old sailing boat. He started working as an actor,
          model, and filmmaker, but his thirst for knowledge was only satisfied
          in 2001 upon encountering <i>I Am That</i>, the seminal work by Sri
          Nisargadatta Maharaj, while he was in India shooting the award-winning
          documentary <i>Short Cut to Nirvana</i>.<br /><br />
          Maurizio and Zaya merged their lifelong passions for science and
          mysticism when they met in 2007, and their first project together was
          filming the documentary <i>Rays of the Absolute</i> on the life and
          teachings of Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj. This project sparked their next
          level of creation and collaboration: Science and Nonduality (SAND)—a
          global community inspired by the timeless wisdom traditions, informed
          by modern science, and grounded in direct experience.<br /><br />
          Foreword writer <b>Deepak Chopra</b> is author of more than seventy
          books, including numerous <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers. His
          medical training is in internal medicine and endocrinology.<br /><br />
          Afterword writer <b>Michael A. Singer</b> is author of the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>The Untethered Soul</i>, which
          has also been published in numerous languages around the world
