            >TV's popular <i>Ghost Hunters </i>reveal all-new, never-before-told
            stories from their spooky early investigations!</b
          ><br /><br /><b
            >For the first time ever, Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, founders of
            The Atlantic Paranormal Society (T.</b
          >A.P.S.), share their most memorable and spine-tingling early cases --
          none of which has ever appeared on television. Beginning with the
          previously untold experiences that sparked their passion for ghost
          hunting, Jason and Grant's bone-chilling investigations uncover:<br />
          <br />• A Connecticut woman who seems to exist in two places at
          once<br />
          • A little girl whose invisible playmate retaliates against her
          father's punishments<br />
          • A man overcome by an evil entity as Jason and Grant survey his
          home<br />
          • A distraught woman who dreams of paranormal events before she
          experiences them...and much more!<br />
          <br />Jason and Grant didn't always have the fancy scientific
          equipment and experienced team that fans now watch on their smash-hit
          television show. As they share their hair-raising first experiences,
          they offer essential tips for budding paranormal investigators --
          including how to use an electromagnetic field (EMF) meter and an
          infrared camera, determine if a supernatural phenomenon is good or
          evil, and deal with spirits. Whether you're a skeptic or a believer,
          these fascinating and frightening true stories will keep you up at
          night!

          "One could not have two better guides than Jason Hawes and Grant
          Wilson when it comes to understanding the permeable membrane between
          our world and the one inhabited by paranormal entities.
          <i>Seeking Spirits</i> is must-reading for those who have experienced
          supernatural phenomena or those who have a passing curiosity about
          ghosts. Hawes and Wilson educate about the science of their field
          while relating compelling personal experiences, and gently remind us
          that being a ghost hunter is not just about understanding the dead,
          but about helping the living explore the parameters of this world."
