            >Called "such a sad, tough story, but finally so life-affirming,
            filled with spirit and love" by Anne Lamott, this is a raw and
            intensely affecting memoir by a young priest about loss of a child,
            its grief and its aftermath, and the hard-won joy that can
            follow.</b
          ><br /><br />Liz Tichenor has taken her newborn son, five weeks old,
          to the doctor, from a cabin on the shores of Lake Tahoe. She is sent
          home to her husband and two-year-old daughter with the baby, who is
          pronounced "fine" by an urgent care physician. Six hours later, the
          baby dies in their bed. Less than a year and a half before, Tichenor's
          mother jumped from a building and killed herself after a long struggle
          with alcoholism. As a very young Episcopal priest, Tichenor has to
          "preach the Good News," to find faith where there is no hope, but she
          realizes these terrible parts of her own life will join her in the
          pulpit. <br /><br /><i>The Night Lake </i>is the story of finding a
          way forward through tragedies that seem like they might be beyond
          surviving and of carving out space for the slow labor of learning to
          live again, in grief.

          "<i>The Night Lake</i> is a memoir written as it was lived—in
          measured, small steps forward . . . A&nbsp;purposeful and artistic
          offering of what it means to live in the wake of death . . .&nbsp;The
          generosity of Tichenor’s writing and her faith remind us that her
          story is our story, too." —Kaethe Schwehn, <i>Christian Century</i>
          <br /><br />"The memoir is a courageous and thoughtful companion to
          all those who have suffered a traumatic loss. Her telling exposes both
          the deep sadness and trauma of deep loss but also reveals the
          overwhelming rage that often is buried and denied under grief. In
          doing so, she gives those who have suffered a traumatic loss
          permission to rant and raise their fist to God in both anger as well
          as hope. —Bonnie McDougall Olson, <i>The Intima<br /><br /></i>"In
          stunning, raw prose, Tichenor invites readers into a heartrending but
          ultimately hopeful story of grief, life and renewal." —Cameron Dezen
          Hammon, <i>America</i> <br /><br />"A book as resolute and grounded in
          the truth of experience as <i>The Night Lake</i> will endure as a
          beacon for anguish . . . In refusing to be placated or comforted by
          strained banalities, Liz Tichenor is reaching for a deeper mode of
          existence and co-existence in which the possibility of real compassion
          is opened by such brave and unguarded storytelling." — Vanessa Able,
          <i>The Dewdrop<br /><br /></i>"This debut memoir from an Episcopal
          priest offers&nbsp;a surprising take on grief, faith and loss . . .
          <i>The Night Lake</i> is&nbsp;an excellent example of making something
          beautiful out of unimaginable pain." —<i>Bookpage</i
          ><br /><br />"Heart-wrenching&nbsp;yet gorgeous . . . Tichenor’s
          honest and plush writing lets readers sink into her settings and
          emotions, whether in grief, hope, or wonder. Perfect for fans of Anne
          Lamott and any reader interested in the intersection of grief and
          faith." ––Kathy Sexton, <i>Booklist</i> (starred review)&nbsp;<br /><br />"A
          powerful, forthright chronicle of surviving profound loss."&nbsp;—<i
            >Kirkus Reviews&nbsp;<br /><br /></i
          >"Tichenor's courageous memoir is an exquisitely crafted, painfully
          beautiful chronicle of loss . . .&nbsp;Navigating as a bereft wife and
          mother, a pastor, a friend and a daughter orphaned because of her
          mother's helplessness, Tichenor discovers that pain, joy and sadness
          can prove enlightening, buoying her with hope and eloquent moments of
          grace.&nbsp;A devastatingly beautiful memoir by a young mother and
          newly ordained Episcopal priest who is forced to reconcile the loss of
          her newborn son." —Kathleen Gerard, <i>Shelf Awareness</i
          ><br /><br />"Written with extraordinary insight and grace,
          <i>The Night Lake</i> is a stunning and powerful reminder that tragedy
          can't be overcome by avoidance; that surrendering to heartache loosens
          its grip; that true acceptance abides even the deepest pain."
          --Margaret Wilkerson Sexton, author of
          <i>The Revisioners<br /><br /></i>"When Tichenor suffers two tragic
          and primary losses in her late twenties, she collapses into grief,
          even as her calling as an Episcopal priest presses her to support
          others in theirs. With grace, humility, and even humor, she grounds
          the unfathomable in rituals ornate and ordinary. The result is a raw
          meditation on fear and courage, loss and love." -- Cynthia Li, MD,
          author of <i>Brave New Medicine</i><br /><br />"From an unspeakable
          loss, Liz Tichenor speaks. With a courage both heartrending and
          fierce, she traces a terrain of aching grace. <i>The Night Lake</i> is
          an astonishingly generous gift."&nbsp;—Jan Richardson, author of
          <i>Sparrow: A Book of Life and Death and Life</i><br /><br />"<i
            >The Night Lake</i
          >
          author Liz Tichenor uses spare, honest, muscular prose to tell a
          rending story of loss . . . In the face of planetary and individual
          death and grief, I learn again from <i>The Night Lake</i> that there
          are companions for us in this world, and that the worl3d is suffused
          with overflowing love. Run––for she is a runner––with
          Tichenor––through the story of loss and love that is
          <i>The Night Lake</i>––it is a story for our time, for all of
          us."--Marc Andrus, Episcopal Bishop of the Diocese of California
