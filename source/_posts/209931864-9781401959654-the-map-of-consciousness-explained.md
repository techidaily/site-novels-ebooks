            >A simple and accessible exploration of the best-selling author of
            <i>Letting Go</i> and <i>Power vs. Force</i> David R. Hawkins, M.D.,
            Ph.D. most famous work, <i>The Map of Consciousness,</i> that will
            help you to experience healing and transcendence.</b
          ><br /><br />World-renowned author, psychiatrist, clinician, spiritual
          teacher, and researcher of consciousness David R. Hawkins shares that
          we are all born with an energetic frequency within the vast field of
          consciousness. And with The Map of Consciousness, we can truly
          understand the total spectrum of human emotions and consciousness.<br /><br />Using
          a unique muscle-testing method, Dr. David R. Hawkins conducted more
          than 250,000 calibrations during 20 years of research to define a
          range of values, attitudes, and emotions that correspond to levels of
          consciousness. This range of values-along with a logarithmic scale of
          1 to 1,000-became the <i>Map of Consciousness</i>, which Dr. David R.
          Hawkins first wrote about in his best-selling book,
          <i>Power vs. Force</i>.<br /><br />With the Map, Dr. David R. Hawkins
          laid out the entire spectrum of consciousness, from the lower levels
          of Shame, Guilt, Apathy, Fear, Anger, and Pride; to Courage,
          Acceptance, and Reason; all the way up to the more expanded levels of
          Love, Ecstasy, Peace, and Enlightenment. These "higher" energy fields
          are a carrier wave of immense life energy.<br /><br />An essential
          primer on the late Dr. David R. Hawkins's teachings on human
          consciousness and their associated energy fields,
          <i>The Map of Consciousness Explained</i> offers an introduction and
          deeper understanding of the Map, with visual charts and practical
          applications to help you heal, recover, and evolve to higher levels of
          consciousness and energy.<br /><br />This enlightening book transcends
          the boundaries of conventional wisdom, integrating the realms of
          psychology, philosophy, and spirituality in a powerful exploration of
          human consciousness and human potential to help you be more effective
          in every area of your life.<br /><br />Some highlights include:<br /><br />·
          A thoughtful fusion of psychology, philosophy, and spirituality.<br /><br />·
          A comprehensive interpretation of the law of attraction and its
          intrinsic link with consciousness and personal evolution.<br /><br />·
          A scientifically grounded guide to harness the power of positive
          thinking and its practical applications.<br /><br />· An insightful
          perspective on the 'power vs force' dynamic, offering fresh insights
          into personal and professional relationships.<br /><br />· An
          enriching collection of practical exercises and affirmations designed
          to awaken and energize your consciousness.<br /><br />Dr. David R.
          Hawkins has a remarkable ability to simplify complex concepts. Whether
          you're in search of motivational books for women, leadership books for
          aspiring entrepreneurs, or behavior books to comprehend the nuances of
          human interaction, this book can revolutionize how you perceive and
          interact with the world, inspiring profound transformation and
          positive change.<br /><br />"<i
            >That which weakens life energy is to be avoided: shame, guilt,
            confusion, fear, hatred, pride, hopelessness, and falsehood. That
            which uplifts life is to be realized: truth, courage, acceptance,
            reason, love, beauty, joy, and peace.</i
          >" –David R. Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D.<br /><br />Whether you're a scholar,
          a personal growth enthusiast, or simply on a path of self-discovery,
          this book will help you live with more awareness and lead a more
          conscious and fulfilling life.
