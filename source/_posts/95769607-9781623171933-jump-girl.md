            >The remarkable life story of growing up psychic and learning to
            work with Spirit, as told by a medium and psychic seer</b
          ><br /><br />Carrying on traditions woven of her Blackfoot and Celtic
          roots, Salicrow is a natural psychic medium from a family with a long
          history of profound connection to the unseen world. In this intimate
          memoir, she tells the story of how she became aware of her gifts as a
          child, how she was taught and encouraged by her grandmother and
          father, and how for more than 25 years she has worked as a seer, using
          the Tarot and Runes as tools to help people communicate with their
          beloved dead, as well as to contact the guiding spirits who watch over
          them. Revealing what it feels like to be called to serve in the
          metaphysical world, she describes her experiences divining the future
          and revisiting the past, speaking with herself from prior lives, time
          traveling to do energetic healing work on the planet, learning from
          the spirits themselves, using kinetic force, continuing to study and
          hone her skills, and much more.

          “Sali’s story teaches us the fundamentals of mediumship, psychic
          perception, geomancy, spiritual healing, and a basket of other unusual
          human capacities. To those who have wondered what it's like to have
          such talents, this book is an intimate revelation.”<br />—From the
          foreword by Robert Simmons<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />“At first a homespun child’s tale
          of the intersection of the spirit world and our everyday lives, this
          book becomes a fascinating exploration of one of our eternal
          mysteries—the boundaries between life and death. For any who have
          gazed into a mirror for a long time, and found the rest of the world
          in there, this book will be very satisfying.”<br />—Katherine
          Quittner, music editor and sound healer<br /><br />“<i>Jump Girl</i>
          is a truly significant story that invites—no, magically draws—us
          inward to seeing the invisible, then back outward to achieve the
          impossible. With the skill of a surgeon, the honesty of a seer, the
          fierceness of a warrioress, and the compassion of a healer, Salicrow
          demonstrates that anyone willing to hear and attend to the call from
          our core can truly become extraordinary.”<br />—Orion Foxwood, author
          of Candle at the Crossroads

        </h4>
        <p>
          SALICROW is a natural psychic medium who has been aware of her gifts
          since childhood. For over twenty-five years she has worked as a seer,
          using the tarot and runes as her tools. With her ability to divine the
          future and revisit the past, she advises her clients with compassion
          and a straight forward approach. As a medium, she helps people to
          connect with their beloved dead, family, friends, and loved ones who
          have passed, as well as make connections with the guiding spirits who
          watch over them. As an intuitive healer, Saliwcrow is dedicated to
          helping the beings of our planet and the Earth itself. She is a reiki
          master in six schools of reiki, a sound healer, druid, and a
          practioner of Rune Valdr and Seithr.<br /><br />Salicrow lives in the
          Northeast Kingdom of Vermont with her husband of twenty-four years.
          Her children, grandchildren, and community are a big part of her life.
          She is a deep lover of sacred travel and has been known to go on
          adventures, near and far, where she can most likely be found doing
          healing work on the spirits of the land and on the land itself.
