            There are many reasons you could have been drawn to this book — or,
            perhaps, this book somehow found you! Are you looking for answers as
            to what happens to your loved ones after they pass? Perhaps you’re
            wondering what you should do after having had a psychic experience.
            Whether you’re a student of psychic studies or a practicing medium,
            a believer or a skeptic, or someone who is bereaved as a result of a
            loss, this book was written to provide you with all the answers to
            your questions about the Other-Side.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Bridging Two Realms</i>, renowned psychic medium
            <b>John Holland</b> offers one of the clearest pictures anyone could
            have of the Spirit World. He draws on his decades of personal
            experiences with Spirit, and includes inspirational stories and
            real-life case studies, to help you pursue the unfoldment of your
            own spiritual abilities safely and wisely. His hope is to help the
            bereaved by giving them comfort and inspiration in knowing that
            there really is <i>life after physical death</i>. There
            <i>is</i> evidence of the Spirit World and what happens in those
            spiritual realms.&nbsp;<b
              >Your loved ones are just a thought away, and you can still
              communicate with them. </b
            >They’re still close, and they often try to reach out to us to lend
            their love and support.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, you will learn that mediumship is not just about
            connecting to the Spirit World; it’s just as much about helping and
            healing the living. There are spiritual bridges that can be built to
            connect to your loved ones who have passed, as well as the most
            important bridge of all: the bridge to your own spirit.

          "The wonderfully gifted and renowned psychic medium John Holland has
          written a comprehensive guidebook to help you understand and develop
          your own intuitive abilities and mediumistic skills.
          <i>Bridging Two Realms</i> is a very practical manual filled with
          beautiful stories, techniques, and exercises. I highly recommend this
          book."<br />— <b>Brian L. Weiss, M.D.</b>, author of
          <i>Many Lives, Many Masters</i><br /><br />"This book is a tour de
          force! I imagine that those who have passed over are clamoring for us
          to read it to know they truly indeed do exist. They want us to learn
          how to contact them — and this book shows us how. There are so many
          things that I love about this book, but the thing that stands out is
          that simply reading it opens a mystic gateway, making it so much
          easier to reach loved ones on the Other-Side. The veil becomes
          thinner, and the light of heaven shines more brightly in your life.
          Your loved ones are truly just a thought away, and
          <i>Bridging Two Realms</i> opens those heavenly gates. I highly
          recommend this book."<br />— <b>Denise Linn</b>, author of
          <i>Sacred Space<br /></i><br />"<i>Bridging Two Realms</i> is a
          must-have for those looking to develop their mediumistic abilities and
          connection to the Spiritual realms. The book gives clear, sound
          information about the psychic and mediumistic process of unfoldment.
          John Holland also introduces those who have lost someone to their own
          soul-to-soul connection with their departed loved ones, allowing us to
          maintain a new relationship with them between two worlds. This is a
          wonderful reference guide you will return to again and again.
          Masterfully done!"<br />— <b>Rev. Janet Nohavec</b>, pastor of Journey
          Within Church and author of <i>Where Two Worlds Meet</i
          ><br /><br />"Bringing messages from departed loved ones to audiences
          and clients around the world, renowned psychic medium and spiritual
          teacher John Holland bridges the gap between Heaven and earth. John
          takes the reader on a journey to learn what the other dimension holds
          for us through after-death communications, and he also imparts
          knowledge on many other topics such as our current incarnation, the
          spiritual body, grief, reincarnation, and tapping into our own psychic
          abilities. Understanding that consciousness continues beyond the veil,
          traditional myths are put aside, opening up a new world where we learn
          that death is nothing to fear, we are never alone, and the soul lives
          forever. I highly recommend this book, not only to those who are
          grieving the loss of loved ones, but also those looking for a deeper
          understanding as to what comes after we leave our physical bodies."<br />—
          <b>Anita Moorjani</b>, author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
          <i>Dying to Be Me</i><br /><br />"<i>Bridging Two Realms</i> is one of
          the most thorough, grounded, practical, and inspired guides into the
          subtle realms you will find anywhere. If you yearn to make personal
          contact with those in the Spirit World, John Holland’s book will
          gracefully open the door and lead you across the veil with ease. It’s
          a beautiful guide."<br />— <b>Sonia Choquette</b>, author of
          <i>Ask Your Guides</i><br /><br />"John Holland is one of the most
          respected psychic mediums in the world. Now in
          <i>Bridging Two Realms</i>, he has opened the doors for everyone to
          learn about Spirit, life after death, and how anyone can connect with
          a departed loved one. Captivating, soul affirming, and a fascinating
          look at the Spirit World, this is a must-read for everyone!"<br />—
          <b>Dougall Fraser</b>, author of <i>Your Life in Color</i
          ><br /><br />"<i>Bridging Two Realms</i>&nbsp;provides a fresh,
          all-encompassing perspective when it comes to communicating with the
          Spirit World. John Holland has the unique ability to convey, in his
          down-to-earth style, the most in-depth information available to all
          who are interested in the afterlife. I’ve truly never seen a more
          detailed, expansive book on bridging two worlds that has the potential
          to change your life! Whether you’re interested in psychic-medium
          abilities, evidence of life after death, or ways to heal your grief,
          John has hit a home run with this magnificent treasure."<br />—
