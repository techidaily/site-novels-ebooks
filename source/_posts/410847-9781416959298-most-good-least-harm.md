            >With a world steeped in materialism, environmental destruction, and
            injustice, what can one individual possibly do to change it? While
            the present obstacles we face may seem overwhelming, author and
            humane educator Zoe Weil shows us that change doesn't have to start
            with an army.</b
          >
          It starts with you. Through her straightforward approaches to living a
          MOGO, or "most good," life, she reveals that the true path to inner
          peace doesn't require a retreat from the world. Rather, she gives the
          reader powerful and practicable tools to face these global issues, and
          improve both our planet and our personal lives. <br />
          <br />
          Weil explores direct ways to become involved with the community, make
          better choices as consumers, and develop positive messages to live by,
          showing readers that their simple decisions really can change the
          world. Inspiring and remarkably inclusive of the interconnected
          challenges we face today, <i>Most Good, Least Harm</i> is the next
          step beyond "green" -- a radical new way to empower the individual and
          motivate positive change.
