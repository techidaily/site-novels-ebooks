            Our orthodoxy that produces our being-to-the-contexts in our life.
            Put simply it produces for us our human nature, to any given life
            situation. In our orthodoxy is the second component -
            <strong>to-know-to-</strong>know-to-be to context. By it, we know to
            express our human nature&nbsp;to get a job, chum with others, and
            court our girlfriend/boyfriend or to be anxious, depressed or angry.
          </p>
          <p>
            The normal patterning of behaviour out of our orthodoxy is the basis
            for the insight by the ancient lyric poet, Horace:
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >"You can take a pitchfork to human nature, but it will always
              come back."</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Herein, we can take Yoda's advice to Luke Skywalker: "You have to
            unlearn, what you have learnt".
          </p>
          <p>
            The simple question "Is it possible to change?" leads Dennis and
            Jennifer to explore change and "the change of change". Discover
            "how-one-knows-to be" and "how-one-KNOWS TO-KNOW-to-be". For those
            of us who have once said, "I've had this problem all my life", there
            is hope. We can change our human nature&nbsp;so that we can say, "I
            no longer have that problem".

          "A transformation happens within you as you read the books written by
          these brilliant authors. This book, especially, offers insights into
          being human in an incredibly truthful way, opening your mind up to the
          possibilities about yourself that once realized you can reach new
          heights in every aspect of your life. Your relationships, work life,
          mental and physical health all start with taking responsibility for
          your own life and this book teaches you HOW to do exactly that." -
          Yusra Debowski, P.Eng.

          "Human Nature by Dennis and Jennifer Chong is a must read for anyone
          who truly seeks to better understand the Human nature of themselves
          and others. The real gift that this work offers is that it goes
          further by providing insight and discovery that will assist clinicians
          to treat and cure patients in ways that completely challenge the
          orthodoxy of tradition psychiatry or psychology. In short, it provides
          insight and solutions." - Steven Corbeil, President of PMC/PGF
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Chong's latest book is a definitive summary of how it is possible
          "to change human nature&nbsp;and actually cure people of their chronic
          smoking, alcoholism, depression, anxiety, and other problem states".
          It is magnificent, profound beyond words and a joy to read. It is
          peppered with humor throughout, which serves to break up the
          encyclopaedia of critical new information into a brilliant yet simple
          package. These pages contain a genuine revolution in thought and
          understanding so radical that it can change the world of counselling
          and psychology. Its personal and humorous style makes it eminently
          readable and enjoyable. Dr. Chong and wife Jennifer are geniuses.
          Their breakthrough perspective gives us tools for regaining
          sovereignty over our lives. This work is thought-provoking,
          insightful, and will hopefully lead people to ask better quality
          questions and make better decisions. Dennis once blessed me with a
          quote which I now return to him and Jennifer: This work is
          "deliciously mad, maddeningly exquisite, exquisitely demanding,
          demandingly rigorous, rigorously challenging, and challengingly
          excellent!" " - Scout Cloud Lee, Ed.D. Emeritus Professor at
          University of Illinois
