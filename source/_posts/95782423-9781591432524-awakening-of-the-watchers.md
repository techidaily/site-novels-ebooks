          Writing together with Timothy Wyllie, the angel Georgia details the
          events of Earth’s ancient history from 16,500 BC to 8,000 BC<br /><br />•
          Chronicles the disappearance of Lemuria, the rise of Atlantean
          technology and piracy, and the first wave of rebel angels incarnating
          as Atlantean slaves<br /><br />• Explains the 3 eras of Atlantis and
          how the island was finally destroyed in 1198 BC<br /><br />•
          Interwoven throughout with observations about Timothy Wyllie’s current
          and previous lives, such as his years of involvement with the Process
          Church<br /><br />After 200 millennia of celestial quarantine in the
          wake of Lucifer’s angelic revolt, Earth and the rebel angels isolated
          here are being welcomed back into the benevolent and caring
          Multiverse. Writing together with Timothy Wyllie, Georgia--a rebel
          angel who took on the role of Watcher after the rebellion--provides
          her personal account of Earth from 16,500 BC to 8,000 BC, a period
          that encompasses the first two eras of Atlantis.<br /><br />Georgia
          shares her experiences being present for the final disappearance of
          Lemuria and the loss of their spiritual system. She describes advanced
          Lemurian technology that was designed for the betterment of the Earth
          and its people, and was then lost, and the aggressive piracy of the
          Atlanteans, who preyed on the Lemurian survivors. Detailing the three
          eras of Atlantis and how the island’s final destruction was in 1198
          BC, she explains the rise of Atlantis as a technological power. She
          reveals the quarrels between the Pleiadians and the Sirians during
          this period and explores the myths of the Anunnaki, reputed to have
          arrived on Earth to mine for gold. Georgia interweaves her story with
          observations about Timothy Wyllie’s current and previous lives,
          focusing here on his involvement with the Process Church as well as
          his experiences with bizarrely orchestrated orgies, psychometrics, and
          psychedelic culture in Europe in the 1970s. <br /><br />Georgia shares
          her words, in part, to awaken some of the more than 100 million rebel
          angels currently living their human lives, most unaware of their
          angelic heritage and struggling with their sense of being different.
          She reveals how a mortal incarnation for a rebel angel is an
          opportunity to redeem the past and help prepare the way for the
          transformation of global consciousness now beginning as the rebel-held
          planets, including Earth, are being welcomed back into the Multiverse.
