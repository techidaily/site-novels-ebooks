          First English translation of the book that introduced the realm of
          Hollow Earth <br /><br />• Explores the underground world of Agarttha,
          sometimes known as Shambhala, a realm that is spiritually and
          technologically advanced beyond our modern culture<br /><br />• One of
          the most influential works of 19th-century occultism<br /><br />•
          Written by the philosopher who influenced Papus, Rene Guénon, and
          Rudolf Steiner<br /><br />The underground realm of Agarttha was first
          introduced to the Western world in 1886 by the French esoteric
          philosopher Alexandre Saint-Yves d’Alveydre with his book
          <i>Mission de l’Inde</i>, translated here for the first time into
          English. Saint-Yves’s book maintained that deep below the Himalayas
          were enormous underground cities, which were under the rule of a
          sovereign pontiff known as the Brahâtma. Throughout history, the
          “unknown superiors” cited by secret societies were believed to be
          emissaries from this realm who had moved underground at the onset of
          the Kali-Yuga, the Iron Age. <br /><br />Ruled in accordance with the
          highest principles, the kingdom of Agarttha, sometimes known as
          Shambhala, represents a world that is far advanced beyond our modern
          culture, both technologically and spiritually. The inhabitants possess
          amazing skills their above ground counterparts have long since
          forgotten. In addition, Agarttha is home to huge libraries of books
          engraved in stone, enshrining the collective knowledge of humanity
          from its remotest origins. Saint-Yves explained that the secret world
          of Agarttha, and all its wisdom and wealth, would be made available
          for humanity when Christianity and all other known religions of the
          world began truly honoring their own sacred teachings.

          “There is a grandeur to this book. Its vivid and elegant prose lifts
          it far above the logorrheic authors of visionary and channeled
          literature. It rivals the fantasy fiction of H. P. Lovecraft or Jorge
          Luis Borges and reminds us that the earth is a place with many
          unexplored corners, enigmas, and surprises in store for us
          surface-dwellers.”

        <p>
          The Marquis Alexandre Saint-Yves d’Alveydre (1842-1909) is a key
          figure of French esoteric tradition who had a great influence on the
          magus Papus (who described Saint-Yves as his “intellectual teacher”)
          as well as Helena Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner, and René Guénon.
          Saint-Yves also was the creator of the Archeometer, a measuring
          instrument, which he claimed was a “key” to understanding the
          Mysteries of the Word.
