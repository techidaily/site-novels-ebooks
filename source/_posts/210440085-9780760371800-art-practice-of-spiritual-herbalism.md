        <p></p>
        <p>
          Trained in Eastern and Western Herbal Medicine, Master Herbalist,
          <b>Karen M. Rose</b> has dedicated her life’s work to empowering
          individuals to reconnect to their own ancestral traditions. Over the
          past 20 years, she has created several outlets to offer her teachings
          and healing modalities to women, people of color, Black, and LGBTQX
          communities. The opening of the Brooklyn-based Sacred Vibes Apothecary
          in 2009 was merely the beginning. Karen has now expanded her
          enterprise, opening Sacred Botanica and Sacred Spice in 2020, two new
          locations in Brooklyn, to make healing more accessible to the greater
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karen’s inspiration for this work began as a child in her native home
          of Guyana, where she was exposed to how African, Caribbean, and Latin
          American traditions profoundly influenced plant medicine and community
          healing. The legacy of these lands is the foundation of Karen’s core
          values and spiritual practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarded as a Spiritual Herbalist, Karen is revered for being the
          first to teach Spiritual Herbalism, plant medicine deeply rooted in
          ancestral healing and spiritual consciousness. Offering guidance to
          those on the path to finding the truth, she has trained over 400
          herbalists through her Spiritual Herbalism Apprenticeship program as
          an act to reclaim their own health and offer healing to their own
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karen’s accomplishments include several in-house projects such as the
          Sacred Vibes’ Annual NYC Spiritual Herbalism Conference, the 2019,
          2020 Herbal Almanac, the Global Virtual Apprenticeship Program, the
          Spiritual Herbalism Apprenticeship Community, and the free Herbal
          Community Summer workshops. Karen has been featured in the
          <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>,
          <i>Black Enterprise</i>, Refinery29, <i>Allure Magazine</i>,
          <i>Organic Life Magazine</i>, and Elle.com and has partnered with
          brands like BET and Squarespace. Karen currently resides in New York
          City with her three children, grandson, parents, and sisters. Her
          family is valued foremost and all of her work is supported by this
          firm foundation.
