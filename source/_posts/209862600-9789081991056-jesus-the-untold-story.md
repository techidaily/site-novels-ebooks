            Most people know Jesus from the four gospels in the Bible and have
            built up a picture from that material. In our times, other writings
            have been found that show a very different Jesus, such as the
            gospels of Thomas, Mary Magdalene and Judas. The Jesus in those
            writings is much more spiritual, sometimes even a mystic, showing us
            the way to our inner selves through insights that we also come
            across in Buddhism, Hinduism and Taoism.
          </p>
          <p>
            This touching novel tells us about Jesus’ childhood, the untold
            story that cannot be found in the Bible. The recently discovered
            manuscripts help shape the story. The author has woven some
            wonderful spiritual insights into the narrative. Judas is for
            instance no longer the traitor and Mary Magdalene no longer the
            whore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The story brings Jesus close like never before, wrestling in a very
            human way with the burden that has been placed on his shoulders. The
            choices that he has to make are so identifiable that many readers
            will recognise aspects of themselves in him.

            beautifully, with so much positivity and purity. I even had to wipe

          Life story of Jesus of Nazareth. The author describes Jesus as
          a&nbsp;spiritual figure: a boy and later man who inspired his
          environment and lived to spread the message from God. Because the
          early life of Jesus gets most attention in this story, it makes the
          whole fascinating. Very well written and easy to read book with wisdom
          and spiritual insights. Dutch Library Association.

          This book delivers what it promises: you get a different view of
          Jesus. The story carries you away. This alone helps to get rid of a
          certain image and see everything from a different perspective. I find
          it very strong. Piet Monsma, pastor PKN (Dutch Protestant Church).
        </p>
        <p>
          In this book we get to know Jesus as a very special man who was
          inspired by God's spirit. It is fascinating to read the famous stories
          from a very human perspective. The book therefore offers a new and
          broader angle on the New Testament. The most important message is that
          the Kingdom of God is closer than we think: it is in ourselves!
