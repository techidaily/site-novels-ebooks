            >Develop your innate intuition, deepen your connection to the energy
            flow of the universe, and manifest your heart's desires using the
            power of your own electromagnetic field by diving deeply into the
            spiritual science of auras, the colorful energy fields that surround
            each and every one of us.</b
          ><br /><br />A fresh take on auras from a medical intuitive who has
          been working with energy on a quantum level for over twenty years.
          Take a deep dive into the history and science of auras with this
          in-depth guide, learning not just what the colors of auras mean and
          how to see them in yourself and others, but how to raise the frequency
          of your own aura and those of others and use that knowledge to
          manifest your best life, filled with harmony and abundance.<br /><br />This
          books dives profoundly into the truth of complete interconnection in
          the universe and the living electromagnetic fields around all living
          things, which we call auras. In essence, the study and awareness of
          auras is an opening to feel the connection between all life. It also
          encourages and necessitates opening the clairvoyant and other
          intuitive senses to feel, taste, smell, touch, see, and hear auras and
          perceive them in new and expanded ways. These experiences allow the
          reader to open mind and heart to the universal life force that
          comprises all existence.
