          Most self-improvement programs train people to identify and solve
          problems by grappling with them endlessly, often to no avail.
          Executive coach Steve Sisgold, however, knows that the body--not the
          mind--is the most reliable and effective pathway to realizing your
          innermost desires and achieving success. His unique, body-centric
          approach will show you how to get out of your head and take charge of
          every area of your life with increased awareness, clarity, and
          confidence. <br /><br />
          <i>Whole Body Intelligence</i> teaches you how to become aware of
          subtle body sensations--such as gripping the phone or clenching your
          jaw during a tense conversation--and how to interpret their meanings,
          linking them to negative thoughts and behaviors that are impeding your
          success and happiness. You will recognize the patterns and imprints
          that have shaped your experiences and decisions for your entire life
          and learn how to change these thoughts and behaviors before they
          become self-sabotaging. No more overthinking! Decisions will become
          easier to make and you will stay engaged, resilient, and relaxed in
          any situation. <br /><br />
          With an easy-to-follow 30-day plan, body centric stress management
          tools, and inspiring stories of people who have changed their lives
          using this system, <i>Whole Body Intelligence</i> empowers you to
          channel the power of your body to achieve your wildest dreams.

          “Steve granted me a huge gift by helping me reclaim my relationship
          with my body so I could learn to feel and interpret what my body is
          telling me. It has become a tuning fork that guides me in all aspects
          of my life. My work with Steve has helped me reclaim my health, heal
          unhealthy relationship patterns, grow on my spiritual path, and heal
          my money issues so I can rewrite the script of the movie of my life.”
          —<i
            >Lissa Rankin, MD, New York Times bestselling author of Mind Over
            Medicine</i
          ><br /><br />“In today's fast-paced world, we use ever-changing
          technology, analytics and metrics to improve performance in many areas
          of our lives. However, Steve Sisgold has tapped into our greatest
          resource-our body's innate intelligence.
          <i>Whole Body Intelligence</i> offers compelling information,
          practical tools and a dynamic program that can help any individual,
          team or organization get to the next level of success.” —<i
            >Andrew Friedman, President of Baseball Operations, Los Angeles
            Dodgers</i
          ><br /><br />“The strategies and techniques in this book will allow
          you to become a better human, business owner or leader. My customers
          are some of the toughest around: the FBI, US Marshals, and the US
          Defense Department. Since becoming whole body intelligent, ideas come
          easier, answers come quicker and I am told I exude a quiet confidence.
          Do yourself a favor - read this book and take some action - you too
          will be better off for it.” —<i>David Hale, CEO, DHA Inc</i
          ><br /><br />“Steve Sisgold has mastered helping others discover and
          change limiting beliefs through the science of Whole Body
          Intelligence. I've experienced WBI in settings like corporate
          coaching, keynotes and a personal intensive. WBI will help you release
          pain, anxiety, and fear and realize more peace and happiness than you
          ever imagined was possible. Read this book and you will feel renewed
          and ready to show up at your best and truly discover the inner peace
          and happiness everyone deserves.” —<i
            >Christine Landon, Senior Director, Leadership &amp; Culture,
            Workday Inc.</i
          ><br /><br />“Steve's work brings us back to the wisdom in our bodies
          and shows us how to experience clarity, confidence, and joy. The
          exercises in this book are a pathway to a fully engaged and purposeful
          life.” —<i
            >Eileen Fisher, Clothing Designer and Founder of EILEEN FISHER,
            Inc.</i
          ><br /><br />“As a physician, I use Steve Sisgold's Whole Body
          Intelligence as my "secret weapon." The information and practices he
          shares in this book has helped my patients on numerous occasions get
          to the core of their physical and emotional issues and live healthier,
          happier and more successful lives.” —<i
            >Richard Shames, MD, author of Thyroid Mind Power</i
          ><br /><br />“Our executives found WBI incredibly useful and on-point.
          IT provided tremendous value, by teaching us how to listen to our
          bodies, re-boot, and ultimately we learned how to tackle specific
          issues that we each face in working in small teams in a very hands-on
          way.” —<i>Rafik Bawa, General Counsel, eBay Inc.</i><br /><br />“This
          is the intelligence everyone needs!
          <i>Whole Body Intelligence</i> will help you navigate life easier. It
          helps me understand unconscious messages my body cues tell me, and
          transforms negative beliefs I carried, into positive ones, all by
          using the intelligence of my own body.” —<i
            >Rachael O'Meara, Sales Manager, Google</i
          ><br /><br />“What Steve shares was one of the watershed turning
          points of our lives. What we learned helped us manifest everything
          that had once seemed only vague dreams before, including appearing on
          <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> twice.” —<i
            >Gay Hendricks, New York Times bestselling author of Five Wishes</i
          ><br /><br />“Every page of this depth-full book will inspire you to
          live in the brilliance of your body, and awaken and utilize the wisdom
          and intelligence that's within you.” —<i
            >SARK, author of Succulent Wild Woman</i
          ><br /><br />“As someone dedicated to mastering the art of living and
          moving in the body, Steve Sisgold offers practical tools for enhancing
          all aspects of my life. It is the simplicity of his work that makes it
          deeply enriching and so powerful in enhancing my in body experience.
