          From the beloved author of the bestselling
          <i>To Bless the Space Between Us</i> and <i>Anam Cara </i>comes a new
          work that shares his insights on nature and the ancient wisdom of this
          earth.<br /><br />John O'Donohue won hundreds of thousands of admirers
          with his now classic work on Celtic spirituality <i>Anam Cara</i>.
          Unfortunately he died suddenly at age fifty-two just as his book of
          blessings, <i>To Bless the Space Between Us</i>, was being published.
          The loss of his powerfully wise and lyrical voice has been profoundly
          missed, but his many readers are given a special opportunity to
          revisit John in a new book based on a series of papers he wrote on the
          elements of water, stone, air, and fire, now published here for the
          first time. O'Donohue's readers know him as both a spiritual guide and
          a poet, and in this work he exhibits both qualities, sharing his
          Celtic heritage and his love for his native landscape in the west of
          Ireland. As O'Donohue explores a range of themes relating to the way
          we live our lives today, he reveals how the energy and rhythm of the
          natural world—its innocence and creativity, its power and
          splendor—hold profound lessons for us all. With a foreword written by
          his beloved brother, Pat, this illuminating book is an inspired
          reflection on the ancient wisdom of the earth.
