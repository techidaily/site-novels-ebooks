          Training methods for tracking and wilderness observation woven into
          extraordinary real-life stories of intuitive animal-reading skills
          <br />
          <br />• Explains technical tracking methods and observational skills
          such as shadowing and envisioning through the innermost thoughts of an
          accomplished native tracker <br />
          <br />• Reveals how to track by expanding your awareness and
          consciousness to become one with the animal you are tracking <br />
          <br />• Shares stories of tracking Wolves, Bears, Deer, Cougars, and
          many other animals <br />
          <br />Stepping beyond the shape of a footprint and into the unseen
          story of the track, veteran wilderness guide Tamarack Song takes you
          inside the eyes and mind of an intuitive tracker, with intimate
          stories where Frogs show the way out of the woods, scat reveals life
          histories, and Bears demonstrate how to find missing people. <br />
          <br />Drawing from his years of surviving in the wild, apprenticing to
          native elders, and living with a family of wolves, Tamarack reveals
          how to achieve a level of perception like that of aboriginal trackers
          by becoming one with the animal you are tracking, whether Fox, Deer,
          Coyote, or Cougar. Sharing his innermost thoughts while following
          track and sign, the book’s adventures merge technical tracking methods
          with skills such as shadowing and envisioning, while demonstrating
          animal-reading skills considered outside the human realm. The author
          explains how to expand your awareness--to learn from nature by
          becoming nature--and tap in to the intuitive tracking consciousness
          each of us has inherited from our Paleolithic ancestors. <br />
          <br />Through his stories from the trail, Tamarack shows the art of
          tracking not simply as a skill for hunters and naturalists but as a
          metaphor for conscious living. By exploring the intricacies of the
          natural world, we explore not only our connections to the world around
          us but also our internal landscapes. We learn to better express
          ourselves and listen, meet our needs, and help others. Intuitive
          tracking provides a path to finding ourselves, becoming one with all
          life, and restoring humanity’s place in the Great Hoop of Life.

          as well as living with a pack of Wolves. In 1987, he founded the
