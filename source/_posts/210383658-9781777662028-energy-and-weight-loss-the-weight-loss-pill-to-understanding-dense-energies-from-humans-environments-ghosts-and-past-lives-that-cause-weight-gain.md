            Energy and Weight loss "The Weight loss Pill" to understanding dense
            energies from humans, environments. ghost and past lives that cause
            weight gain! Inspired by true events of Kerri Hermary, a survivor of
            30 years of family violence, she couldn't walk away but learned
            through her guide, "Mel" she had to heal a past life blueprint, that
            kept her an energetic prisoner, over weight and very unhealthy in
            this lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world is full of humans living dysfunctional lifestyles that
            want change but don't know how. Humans can't change if they aren't
            aware of what is causing the repeat patterns. Knowledge is powerful!
          </p>
          <p>
            Four million women get assaulted by a domestic partner.
            Approximately 67% of Canadians personally know at least one woman
            who lives with family violence. Children who witness abuse have
            twice the rate of psychiatric disorders than non violent homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            One-third of people (34%) believe they have had some sort of psychic
            episode. Psychic occurrences are more common among women (40%) than
            men (29%). Among buyers 69% of people are looking for their purpose
            through spirituality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The American journal of clinical Nutrition states weight gain
            remains challenge. There are 56.4% women and men 41.7% who have
            tried to reduce their weight in all age groups.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through Kerri's own challenges with physical and mental abuse
            experienced all the above and through seeing proof from true events
            that everything is energy but energy can cause chaos within the
            human body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the pages of energy and weight loss the reader will learn
            their circumstances is not who they truly are. That they are an
            energy being born with psychic abilities and life purpose which lies
            dormant within the blueprint for this lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blueprint is the road map that every humans for each lifetime.
            The blueprint can't be seen physically because it is located within
            the Energy Being.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Energy Being enters into the Physical Being after the first
            breathe is taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            The physical body is developed within another physical body and the
            Energy being comes complete from spirit. Both being's need each
            other to survive while on the earth plane.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Physical body was developed especially for the Energy Being, the
            house to protect the Energy being. The physical being enables the
            high vibrating Energy being to move a round on earth in a denser
            energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Physical body has systems and the Energy being has body systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans are taught about the physical body systems in school but not
            the energy systems. Kerri's book will educate the reader on the
            energy systems and their importance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Energy being arrives within the Physical body with the blue
            print need for this lifetime experiences. The Energy being designed
            the blueprint to match what the Energy being wants to experience in
            this lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans relationships, jobs, life choices all can be located within
            their blueprint. The Energy being knows exactly what the physical
            being needs to do with in this lifetime but the physical being has
            no clue about the blueprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a chosen lifestyle the Energy must educate the Physical
            being during the dysfunction so the two beings can come together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kerri's Energy being chose family violence because the blueprint for
            this lifetime was about learning how the abuse affected not only her
            but her family and how energy played an important role in keeping
            Kerri in a prison of her own design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone in Kerri's blueprint was hand picked for this lifetime
            task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans don't know the bigger plan but the Energy being does and
            always has control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Human become lost and the Energy being becomes found through being
            sick, overweight, depressed and wanting change.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kerri's story and her book will give others the understanding of
            their own story and that change is possible!
