            >Open your mind, have fun, and get ready to experience the greatest
            mystery of all.<br /></b
          ><br />The saints and mystics are unanimous in their belief that we
          are not the separate beings we believe ourselves to be, but that we
          are in reality—<i>One</i>. Best-selling author, filmmaker, and
          musician James Twyman tested this in a dramatic experiment that has
          inspired hundreds of thousands of people, proving that our thoughts
          can be shared and that we aren’t as isolated as we once thought.
          There’s a bond that exists between us, an unseen link that unites and
          satisfies us in ways that nothing else can. In the end, what we’re
          seeking isn’t the riches of the world, but the richness of our souls;
          and this can only come from realizing that we are connected and whole.
          Simply put: <i>we are One</i>.<br /><br />Join James and spiritual
          teacher Anakha Coman as they break down the process of discovering
          Oneness into 40 practices that can profoundly change your life.
          Through step-by-step instructions, James also shows you how to
          re-create his amazing experiment, enabling you to connect to the
          stream of Oneness and actually tune in to the thoughts of others.
          Unearth your own hidden power and achieve the miracles you’ve only
          dreamed of before! This is more than an instruction manual—it’s a
          doorway into a new world.

        </h4>
        <p>
          James F. Twyman is the best-selling author of ten books, including The
          Moses Code, Emissary of Light, and The Art of Spiritual Peacemaking.
          He’s also an internationally renowned "Peace Troubadour" who has the
          reputation for drawing millions of people together in prayer to
          positively influence crises throughout the world. He has been invited
          by leaders of countries such as Iraq, Northern Ireland, South Africa,
          Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia to perform The Peace Concert—often while
          conflicts raged in those areas; and he has performed at the United
          Nations, the Pentagon, and more. James is the executive producer and
          co-writer of the feature film Indigo, and the director of Indigo
          Evolution and the documentary The Moses Code. He is also a member of
          the Order of St. Francis and the co-director of the World Community of
          Saint Francis. Anakha Coman is a sacred-heart mystic walking and
          teaching the path of embodied love and reclaiming the sacred feminine.
          She is an ordained New Thought minister and founder of The FireHeart
          Sanctuary, a beloved community of sacred activists devoted to
          resurrecting the essential teachings of Yeshua and Magdalene and
          living the Christ consciousness. Anakha is an inspired speaker who
          shares her intimate experience of the mystic’s path with churches,
          spiritual centers, and organizations throughout the Pacific Northwest
          and abroad.
