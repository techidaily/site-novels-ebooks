            The The Emerald Tablet of Hermes &amp; Kybalion compose two pillars
            of Hermetic thought. Combined here in one volume, these two works
            share true wisdom with those ready to receive it. “When the ears of
            the student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to fill them
            with wisdom.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kybalion was first published anonymously in 1908 by “The Three
            Initiates.” The true authorship of the work is unknown, although
            theories suggest it was written entirely or in part by William
            Walker Atkinson.
          </p>
          <p>
            Atkinson was a prolific writer and supported the New Thought
            movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries. New Thought included
            the belief that our realities can be manifested by mental effort,
            which is also suggested in Hermetic principles. Scholars point to
            similarities in style and content between The Kybalion and
            Atkinson’s own The Arcane Teachings as evidence that he was one (or
            all) of “The Three Initiates.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kybalion provides an introduction to the teachings of Hermes
            Trismegistus—Hermes “the Thrice-Greatest.” This “Master of Masters”
            is said in The Kybalion to have lived 300 years on Earth, and
            believed by some to be the founder of both astrology and alchemy
            (precursors to astronomy and chemistry, respectively). Hermes
            Trismegistus was deified after his death as Toth by the ancient
            Egyptians, and Hermes by the Greeks. In both pantheons, this
            man-turned-god was considered a symbol of great wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Kybalion's explanation of Hermetic teachings are claimed to have
            been passed down orally for centuries, eventually reaching “The
            Three Initiates.” The fundamental Hermetic traditions presented in
            The Kybalion consist of seven “working principles”: Mentalism,
            Correspondence, Vibration, Polarity, Rhythm, Cause and Effect, and
            Gender. Within these seven principles is true wisdom, tied to no
            particular place and no particular religion. It is the “sacred
            flame” kept lit by a chosen few used to “re-light the lesser lamps
            of the outside world when the light of truth grew dim…” In short,
            these are the truths of the universe, regardless of era or creed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Emerald Tablet of Hermes is a short, ancient text attributed to
            Hermes Trismegistus himself. Unlike The Kybalion, which aims to
            provide some explanation and instruction, the brief Emerald Tablet
            has been puzzling and fascinating scholars for over 1,000 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consisting of a mere 14 stanzas, the Emerald Tablet is said to
            contain the secrets of prima materia—the foundational material of
            the universe. The Emerald Tablet and its teaching influenced
            freemasonry and philosophy throughout history. The text of the
            tablet has been translated and commented on by a variety of
            scholars, including Sir Isaac Newton who was inspired by its
            teachings throughout his life and work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The earliest known version of the text comes from an Arabic work
            written between the 6th and 8th centuries by Balinas. He claimed to
            have found the tablet hidden in a vault beneath a statue of Hermes.
            Another story claims the tablet was written by Seth, the third son
            of Adam and Eve. And yet another says the tablet was uncovered and
            then reburied by Alexander the Great.
          </p>
          <p>
            The source and material of the physical tablet is unknown. It was
            reported to be a rectangular green stone, with text in raised
            bas-relief rather than engraved. Some even claim there never was a
            physical tablet at all, although several accounts claim it was on
            display in Egypt in 330 BCE. Whatever its origins and history, the
            work was first introduced to the West in the 12th century through
            Latin translations. Since then, this cryptic text has been
            translated and re-translated, pored-over and analyzed by
            philosophers, historians, and theologians alike.
