          A step-by-step guide to the process of “scripting” your future and
          successfully manifesting what you want in life <br /><br />• Explores
          the science behind how the scripting method works and shares the vivid
          journal entries from the author’s big breakthrough--when he
          successfully used his method to land a lead role on a TV show<br /><br />•
          Details how the understanding of incredible new (and, until now,
          mostly unheard of) scientific discoveries and emerging technologies is
          the most important key to creating and manifesting in your life<br /><br />•
          Reveals fun, easy tools for manifesting and self-help, updated for a
          new generation <br /><br />In this step-by-step guide, filled with
          success stories and practical exercises, Royce Christyn details a
          simple “scripting” process for harnessing the Law of Attraction and
          manifesting what you want in your life--happiness, wealth, travel,
          love, health, the perfect career, or simply a productive day. The
          process is backed by science and experience, yet it feels like magic.
          And all you need is a pen and paper. <br /><br />Inspired by New
          Thought and Positive Thinking classics, Christyn explains how he
          developed his scripting method through 4 years of trial and error,
          keeping what worked and dropping what didn’t until he brought his
          success rate from 5% to nearly 100%. Sharing pages from his own
          journals, he outlines how to create the life you want with daily
          journaling exercises, beginning with a simple list-making practice to
          figure out your wants and intentions and then progressing to actual
          scripting of your future, whether the next 12 hours or the next 10
          days. He shows how, over time, your scripts will increase in accuracy
          until they converge with reality. He shares the vivid entries from his
          big breakthrough--when he successfully used his method to land a lead
          guest-starring role on Disney Channel’s
          <i>Wizards of Waverly Place</i> with Selena Gomez. He explores how
          “feeling” your future success as you write your daily scripts helps
          attract your desired outcomes, and he shares the key phrases to
          include to make your script come true. The author also explores the
          science behind how the scripting method works, including a
          down-to-earth examination of quantum mechanics. <br /><br />From small
          dreams to lifelong goals, this book gives you the tools to put your
          thoughts into action and finally close the gap between where you are
          and where you want to be in your life.

          "I love that the author presents a simple way to bring about changes
          in our day-to-day lives quickly. If you are drawn to the theory of the
          law of attraction but have trouble manifesting your desires, this book
          might help. The author writes with a passion and enthusiasm that
          inspired me to write my first daily script. This helped me focus on
          the day ahead. However, he does go into a lot of scientific
          information about how and why he thinks this works, which I’m not sure
          I needed. Nevertheless, this guide is good at showing you how to
          incorporate scripting into your life. All you need is a pen and
          paper."
