          An exploration of the sexual practices and doctrinal secrets of
          Gnosticism<br /><br />• Reconstructs the lost world of Gnostic
          spiritual-erotic experience through examination of every surviving
          text written by heresiologists <br /><br />• Investigates the sexual
          gnosis practices of the Barbelo Gnostics of the 2nd century and their
          connections to the Gnostic Aeon Sophia, the Wild Lady of Wisdom
          <br /><br />• Explains the vital significance of “the seed” as a
          sacrament in Gnostic practice<br /><br />Examining every surviving
          text written by heresiologists, accounts often ignored in favor of the
          famous Nag Hammadi Library, Tobias Churton reveals the most secret
          inner teaching passed down by initiated societies: the tradition of
          sexual gnosis--higher union with God through the sacrament of sex.
          Discovering actual sex practices hidden within the writings of the
          Church’s authorities, he reconstructs the lost world of Gnostic
          spiritual-erotic experience as taught by initiated masters and
          mistresses and practiced by Christian couples seeking spiritual
          freedom from the world. <br /><br />Churton explores the practices of
          the “first Gnostic,” the historical Simon Magus, and explains the
          vital significance of “the seed” in Gnostic practice, showing it to be
          the sacramental substance <i>par excellence</i>. He illuminates the
          suppressed truth of why the name “Valentine” came to be associated
          with ennobling erotic love and reveals profound parallels between
          sexual gnosis and Tantra, suggesting that gnosis lies at the root of
          the tantric path. <br /><br />Solving a millennia-old riddle regarding
          the identity and secret symbol of Sophia, the mysterious Gnostic
          “Aeon,” Churton investigates Sophia’s connections to Barbelo, also
          known as <i>Pruneikos</i>, the Wild Lady of Wisdom, and the central
          focus of the Barbelo Gnostics of the 2nd century, whose religious sex
          practices so shocked orthodox Christian contemporaries that they were
          condemned, their cults of spiritual gnosis and “redemption by sin”
          driven underground.<br /><br />Churton exposes the mystery of Sophia
          in the philosophy of the medieval Troubadours and explores William
          Blake’s inheritance of secret Renaissance sexual mysticism through the
          revolutionary English poet Andrew Marvell. Showing how Blake’s sexual
          and spiritual revolution connects to modern sexual magic, Churton also
          examines the esoteric meaning of the free-love explosion of the 1960s,
          revealing how sex can be raised from the realm of guilt into the
          highest magical sacrament of spiritual transformation.

        <p>
          “Churton brings to this frank and deeply insightful study a
          surprisingly personal and moving narrative. The late scholar of
          Gnosticism Ioan Couliano once said the Gnostics were the champions of
          free thought--asserting a freedom to explore every logical possibility
          of their complex demiurgic estrangement from God and nature. It’s not
          so surprising then that sexual metaphysics and practices in all of
          their permutations were explored, along with the big questions they
          pose, and the gnosis they transmit. As Churton observes, ‘The new
          heaven and new earth result from an improvement of sensual enjoyment.
          There was, and is, need of it.’”
