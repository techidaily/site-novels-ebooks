            >What if you awoke tomorrow with amnesia—no memory of who you are,
            what you like and dislike, and so on. Would you be the same person?
            <br /><br /></b
          >What if, as in the movie The Matrix, you discovered that everything
          was a simulation and you were just a programmed component? What if
          everything you believed was false? Who would you be then?<br /><br />
          Eldon Taylor has been researching the power of the mind for more than
          25 years. He has repeatedly demonstrated the overt attempts that have
          been made to control your thinking. While very interesting in theory,
          most of us do not understand this on a personal level. It is easy to
          understand the concept of Mind Programming when it is occurring with
          someone else, but most would deny that they too are victims.
          <br /><br /><i>What If?</i> is a very personal book. By using everyday
          situations and guiding you through numerous thought experiments, Eldon
          does an excellent job of peeling back the layers and revealing the
          dissonance in much of your thinking, beliefs, desires, and
          choices—contradictory beliefs held at the same time with no apparent
          awareness. <br /><br />Once you have seen your own mind with the
          filtered lenses removed, it is impossible to remain the same. That is
          why so many have praised this work as being absolutely
          life-changing—not just a fascinating read—but a transformational
          experience!
