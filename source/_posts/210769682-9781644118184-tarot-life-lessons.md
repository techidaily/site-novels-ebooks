            >Real-life stories using the Tarot as a tool of insight and
            self-transformation</b
          ><br /><br />• Explores the living wisdom of the Tarot, based on the
          author’s more than 40 years’ experience as a professional Tarot
          reader<br /><br />• Shares stories from the author’s client readings
          to show how each card tells a story and how it only takes a small
          amount of familiarity to decipher a world full of meaning in the
          cards<br /><br />• Shows how to use the Tarot to grow your strengths,
          identify your weaknesses, conquer problems, and move on from painful
          situations<br /><br />As Julia Gordon-Bramer reveals in profound
          detail, the miracle of tarot is how the right cards show up, time and
          time again, to provide guidance or symbolically illustrate your
          story—whether you believe in the tarot or not. <br /><br />In these
          real-life tales of tarot wisdom, Gordon-Bramer explores the modern
          applications and the living wisdom of the tarot, based on her more
          than 40 years’ experience as a professional tarot reader. Sharing
          stories from client readings and her own spiritual journey, she shows
          how to intuitively, logically, and sometimes playfully glean the
          meaning of each card that appears and integrate its powerful spiritual
          lessons for deeper understanding, guidance, and personal healing. She
          compares reading the tarot to dream analysis, explaining how the Major
          Arcana, such as the Fool, the Magician, the Lovers, and the Star,
          represent the key players and milestones in life, the sacred adventure
          from birth to death. She explains how each card tells its own story,
          often revealing subconscious beliefs and motivations through its
          colors, numbers, symbols, and pictures. <br /><br />Allowing you to
          make the leap from an abstract understanding of the tarot to actually
          working intuitively with the cards, this book shows how, when used as
          a life-transforming tool to awaken and tame the subconscious, the
          tarot offers a way to grow your strengths, identify your weaknesses,
          and conquer problems as you journey through life.
