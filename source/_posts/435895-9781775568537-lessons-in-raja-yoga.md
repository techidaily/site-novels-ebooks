          <p>
            In India, the Candidates for Initiation into the science of "Raja
            Yoga," when they apply to the Yogi Masters for instruction, are
            given a series of lessons designed to enlighten them regarding the
            nature of the Real Self, and to instruct them in the secret
            knowledge whereby they may develop the consciousness and realization
            of the real "I" within them. They are shown how they may cast aside
            the erroneous or imperfect knowledge regarding their real identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until the Candidate masters this instruction, or at least until the
            truth becomes fixed in his consciousness, further instruction is
            denied him, for it is held that until he has awakened to a conscious
            realization of his Actual Identity, he is not able to understand the
            source of his power, and, moreover, is not able to feel within him
            the power of the Will, which power underlies the entire teachings of
            "Raja Yoga."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Yogi Masters are hot satisfied if the Candidate forms merely a
            clear intellectual conception of this Actual Identity, but they
            insist that he must feel the truth of the same - must become aware
            of the Real Self - must enter into a consciousness in which the
            realization becomes a part of his everyday self - in which the
            realizing consciousness becomes the prevailing idea in his mind,
            around which his entire thoughts and actions revolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            To some Candidates, this realization comes like a lightning flash
            the moment the attention is directed toward it, while in other cases
            the Candidates find it necessary to follow a rigorous course of
            training before they acquire the realization in consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Yogi Masters teach that there are two degrees of this awakening
            consciousness of the Real Self. The first, which they call "the
            Consciousness of the 'I'," is the full consciousness of real
            existence that comes to the Candidate, and which causes him to know
            that he is a real entity having a life not depending upon the body -
            life that will go on in spite of the destruction of the body - real
            life, in fact. The second degree, which they call "the Consciousness
            of the 'I AM'," is the consciousness of one's identity with the
            Universal Life, and his relationship to, and "in-touchness" with all
            life, expressed and unexpressed. These two degrees of consciousness
            come in time to all who seek "The Path." To some it comes suddenly;
            to others it dawns gradually; to many it comes assisted by the
            exercises and practical work of "Raja Yoga."
