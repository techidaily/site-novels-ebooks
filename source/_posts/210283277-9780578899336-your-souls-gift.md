              relationships, sexuality, incest, adoption, poverty, suicide,
              rape, and mental illness. Working with a team of gifted mediums,
              Schwartz brings forth great love and wisdom from the other side to
              explain why such experiences are planned and the deep, soul-level
              healing they can create.</span

          "This book is an incredible guide map to your soul and the various
          jewels stored inside it. Read this to reconnect with your TRUE SELF."
          -&nbsp;James Van Praagh, author of&nbsp;Growing Up in Heaven

          "Rob Schwartz offers deep wisdom into the nature of our soul and the
          purpose of our lives. He explains life and karma with clarity and
          elegance." -&nbsp;Arielle Ford, author of&nbsp;The Soulmate Secret

        <p>
          "I was deeply impressed by Your Soul's Gift. This is a fine discussion
          of one of the great mysteries of existence: To what degree do we plan
          our lives before we are born? Rob Schwartz offers a profound spiritual
          analysis of some of life's most difficult crises and turning points.
          This book is well worth reading for its novel and surprising insights
          into the difficulties most of us face in life." -&nbsp;Raymond Moody,
          MD, PhD, author of&nbsp;Life After Life
        </p>

        <p>
          "For anyone who has unfinished anger, guilt, anxiety, or depression, I
          strongly recommend you read this outstanding, insightful book . . . to
          complete your journey to peace with yourself for the choices you made
          before you were born." -&nbsp;Norm Shealy, MD, PhD
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your Soul's Gift: The Healing Power of the Life You Planned Before
          You Were Born continues beyond Robert Schwartz's amazing first book.
          Here Schwartz brings more insights to us, insights that help us regain
          our strength and our knowing of who we are following devastating,
          life-changing experiences." - Sara J. Ruble, on Amazon

          "Robert Schwartz writes with compassion and empathy. He gently invites
          readers to view pre-birth agreements, healing, soul plans, past lives,
          free will, death, and life challenges through the captivating and
          insightful stories he researched. Schwartz is a clear-thinking,
          articulate individual with a big and awakened heart, who is committed
          to enlightening and inspiring others. He invites readers on a journey
          of a collective spiritual awakening."&nbsp;-&nbsp;Chris Mulligan, on
          Amazon
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          "The chapters are brilliantly positioned. There is an ebb and flow to
          the poignant stories; the reader is given respites between high
          intensity moments. Schwartz uses intellect and heart to create a
          flowing piece that does not overwhelm, but instead threads hope,
          succor, and inspiration throughout the material. I would encourage
          people to consider this book for their personal healing. This book is
          a powerful catalyst for change, helping you move to new vistas." -
