          For centuries, it has been assumed that there are vast limits to human
          capacity. Now, although a host of scientific discoveries prove this
          wrong, a mindset of limits persists, blocking us from our greatest
          possibilities and leaving us feeling bombarded by stress, change, and
          uncertainty. No matter how hard we work, no matter how much we give,
          we're still not getting what we hoped for. There is another way.<br /><br />Dr.
          Robert Cooper, a neuroscience pioneer and leadership advisor, urges us
          to take a radically different view of human capacity. We are mostly
          unused potential, he says, employing less than 10 percent of our
          brilliance or hidden talents. In easy-to-follow steps, he explains how
          to develop and apply the art and science of your hidden capacity.<br /><br />The
          art is the motivation and inspiration coming from the wonderful
          stories that are the heart of <b>The Other 90%</b>. Dr. Cooper draws
          on his wide-ranging insights and experiences to show how it's possible
          to make a difference in yourself and others.<br /><br />However,
          inspiration without a way to turn vision into reality is an empty
          vessel. Combining art with science, Dr. Cooper provides extraordinary
          help in the form of specific, little-known practical ways to use the
          latest research in neuroscience, performance psychology, and work
          physiology for excelling in a pressure-filled world. He shows you how
          to:<br /><br />* Increase energy at work -- and have more energy for
          personal and family life.<br /><br />* Activate the brain's "alertness
          switches" to defeat pressure and stress.<br /><br />* Use not only the
          brain in your head but the ones in your heart and gut.<br /><br />*
          Motivate exceptional ingenuity and performance in yourself and
          others.<br /><br />The most exciting breakthroughs will not come from
          advances in technology but from a deeper realization of what it means
          to be most human and alive. Many of the choices that can dramatically
          change our lives are simple and practical -- yet few people know what
          these choices are or how to apply them in work and life.
          <b>The Other 90%</b> is your guide to new territory and new
          challenges.

          daily lives and in the world of work. <b>The Other 90%</b> is that
          kind of book. Robert Cooper brilliantly upends conventional thinking
          about human capacity."<br />

          highest ratings, including inherent value, usefulness, applicability,
          and overall results." <br />-- John C. Horton, founder and president,
          The Leadership Center, Atlanta<br /><br />"This is a vital wake-up
          call to find the untapped potential in yourself and others."<br />
          -- Martha Rogers, Ph.D., coauthor of <b>The One to One Future</b
          ><br /><br />"Goes right to the heart of what matters most in
          leadership and life, with compelling insights from neuroscience,
