            What happens to our loved ones when they die? Can we communicate
            with them? How do they spend their time?
          </p>
          <p>
            After her daughter, Sam, passed away, Beverly Holliday sought
            answers to these questions. Through divine guidance, she found
            professional mediums who helped her connect with her daughter on the
            other side. These dialogues comforted and healed Beverly while
            illuminating an existence beyond earthly life. She devoted several
            years to recording and transcribing her conversations with her
            daughter, with the mission of sharing Sam's messages-to bring hope
            and comfort to others who are grieving or seeking guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
            This true story offers a glimpse into Beverly's life as the mother
            of a gentle, compassionate child who left this world unexpectedly.
            Throughout the book, Sam shares her insights about her time on earth
            and many fascinating and uplifting details about her life in heaven.
            These messages from Sam have dramatically changed Beverly's view on
            life, the afterlife, and losing her child-transforming her grief
            into joy.

          This is an author and a story you can trust. A fascinating, moving,
          and inspiring memoir about love, faith, and courage. This book taught
          me a lot about life after death-which, in turn, changed my life for
          the better.

          I think anyone who has experienced loss or wonders about what comes
          next should read this book. The overall tone of this book is uplifting
          and hopeful. I loved the short, easily digestible chapters that gave
          insight into Beverly's life, as well as Sam's (here and beyond). I
          have never heard of the afterlife described in the way Sam has
          communicated it. It is both intriguing and comforting.

          This true story was both educational and inspirational. Loss is always
          hard, but this book gave me hope. I am grateful the author
          courageously shared her experiences and passed on the wisdom! My
          future seems so much brighter now.

          This book has been therapeutic for me to read, as I'm still grieving
          the loss of a friend. Anyone who has lost someone can find something
          relatable in it. Highly recommend for women, mothers, daughters, and
          anyone grieving the loss of a loved one.

          Poignant, uplifting, and inspiring, Messages from Sam is a testament
          to the power of love-and a beautiful reminder that we are always
          supported by our loved ones on the other side. All we have to do is
          listen.
