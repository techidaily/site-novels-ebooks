            Ancient philosophers suggested that the appearance of spirits is
            evidence that we are part of a larger community of intelligences, a
            universe of interrelated species, both physical and nonphysical.
            Master ghost hunter and best-selling author Brad Steiger invites you
            to join him as he explores the many dark and nightmarish pathways
            leading to this shadowy world of spirits and hauntings.
            <b><i>Real Ghosts, Restless Spirits, and Haunted Places</i></b> is
            the defining work on spirit phenomena. It is a comprehensive
            classification of the spirit world touching on every possibility
            from time travel to parallel universes, presenting the full range of
            ghostly manifestations and haunted locations. A major work sure to
            be heralded by paranormal enthusiasts (whatever their corporeal
            state).

            Do you know the difference between poltergeists and spirits of the
            dead? The differences between spirits residue, spirit parasites and
            spirit masqueraders? With its 30 topical chapters,
            <i><b>Real Ghosts</b></i
            >, covers those differences and many more:
          </p>
          Spirits Seen at Death Beds and Funerals Haunted Churches, Cemeteries,
          and Burial Grounds Phantoms on Roads and Highways Battlefields Where
          Phantom Armies Eternally Wage War Speaking to Spirits: The Mystery of
          Mediumship Animal Ghosts—Domesticated and Wild Spirit Parasites That
          Possessed Apparitions of Religious Figures Haunted Hotels, Motels, and
          Inns
          <p>
            Did you know that ghosts still haunt Ohio’s State Reformatory,
            otherwise known as Shawshank? Or that the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
            is home to some of the most famous ghosts in the world? With Real
            Ghosts, you’ll discover that Abe Lincoln regularly consulted
            “spooks” and mediums, Rudolph Valentino haunts his old mansion, and
            the ghosts of Anne Boleyn, Henry VIII, Katharine Howard, Jane
            Seymour, Elizabeth I, and King George III all still haunt some of
            England’s most famous castles. You’ll also learn how to perform a
            cleansing ritual to rid your home of unwanted spectral visitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            More than a collection of true ghost stories, this book plunks you
            square into the middle of the eerie action with captivating stories
            that would be at home at any midnight campfire. The only difference
            is these stories aren't urban legends employing hooks, needles, or
            long, metal fingernails for their scare. These stories exist outside
            of the mind and live right next door to every one of us.
            <b><i>Real Ghosts</i></b> shouldn't be read when you are home alone
            and the lights begin to flicker!
