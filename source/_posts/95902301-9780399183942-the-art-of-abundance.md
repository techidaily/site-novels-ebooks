            >A life of wholeness and purpose are well within our reach--<i
              >The Art of Abundance</i
            >
            outlines ten rules, or practices, that lay the foundation for a life
            worth living.</b
          ><br /><br />Whether we're striving for a new job, a higher salary, or
          a stronger relationship, Dennis Merritt Jones explains in
          <i>The Art of Abundance</i> that we all essentially want the same
          things: freedom, inner peace, and a life filled with purpose and
          meaning. He shows that a life of wholeness and peaceful satisfaction
          is readily available to us--we just need the eyes to see it and the
          faith to claim it. The problem is that most people don't know where to
          look for such a life. This book will help readers open their eyes to
          the limitless abundance that lies waiting just beyond their current
          belief system.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
          <i>The Art of Abundance</i>, Jones identifies ten rules, or practices
          that, when followed faithfully, lay the foundation for a life worth
          living. In order to make each rule as easy to apply as possible, Jones
          lays out the premise, the problem, the principle, the practice, and
          the payoff of each. These practices assist readers in creating a
          greater flow of goodness into their lives--in ways they may have never
          considered.
