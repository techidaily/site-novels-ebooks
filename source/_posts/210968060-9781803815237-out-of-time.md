          In Out of Time: The Intergenerational Abduction Program Explored,
          author Steve Aspin has written a crossover work about the enduring
          worldwide reports of alien abduction. The book is intended for both
          those familiar with the historic published case material and the
          curious reader unfamiliar with the decades of serious academic
          research on this superficially improbable phenomenon.The author
          details his lifelong personal experience and the relationships he
          built with leading researchers during 15 years of investigating this
          phenomenon. He has at all times attempted to approach the subject with
          critical thoroughness and intellectual rigour.From stumbling on a
          cattle mutilation in Ireland in 1970, to witnessing a UFO after a
          period of missing time at age 16 in 1972, to a confrontational
          experience in a Sardinia hotel in 2006, the author relates a lifetime
          of 'anomalous' experiences. But this is only the starting point of the
          journey the reader of Out of Time will make. Steve then details
          several years of investigation into the subject and how what he has
          learned has shaped his thoughts on what is happening to perhaps
          millions of people worldwide. He had the good fortune to meet with
          several leading researchers in the field including Budd Hopkins and Dr
          David Jacobs and read hundreds of published works on the subject of
          UFOs and abductions. He has attempted to bring hard forensic evidence
          to the discussion and to follow that evidence where it may lead,
          paying particular attention to the clearly intergenerational aspect of
          the global abduction program which he demonstrates, with corroborating
          evidence, almost certainly dates from the 1890s.His conclusions will
          be of interest to anyone attentive to this field of study. Whether
          inevitably proved right or wrong, they stem from a conscious effort to
          bring objectivity and honesty to the analysis of this widely-reported
          phenomenon.Although successfully normalised in popular culture to
          become background noise or a minor comic footnote in otherwise busy
          lives, this subject has real and serious implications for both the
          individual experiencer and human society collectively.
