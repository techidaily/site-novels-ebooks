          An examination of the use of psychedelics for understanding ourselves,
          connecting with the world around us, and enacting outer change through
          inner transformation <br /><br />• Explores sacred tools and
          technologies to help us reestablish a lost ideology of unity, with a
          specific focus on natural plant/fungi psychedelics <br /><br />• Looks
          at the history of psychedelics and their role in facilitating natural
          intelligence’s ability to increase itself through ongoing analysis of
          its own experience <br /><br />• Provides guidelines for safely using
          natural plant/fungi psychedelics and integrating them into society to
          access unified consciousness and restore balance to our world
          <br /><br />Our ecological, social, and political issues all stem from
          the ideologies that drive our collective actions. In contrast to our
          innate humanity, which is rooted in unity, these ideologies have led
          us to believe that we are separate from each other, separate from
          nature, and separate from the results of our actions. Such a worldview
          encourages individuals to maximize self-interest, which then causes
          fragmentation, conflict, pollution, and the depletion of natural
          resources. Offering practical steps that we can take to heal ourselves
          and our fragmented world, author Daniel Grauer explores the use of
          sacred tools and technologies, such as natural psychedelics,
          meditation, and yoga, in order to reestablish an ideology of unity,
          work in symbiotic harmony with the Earth, and restore our world as a
          sustainable and prosperous whole. <br /><br />Grauer explains how
          individuals--and by extension societies--benefit from safely accessing
          transcendent states of consciousness, such as those provided by
          psychedelics. He explores how psychoactive substances have been used
          throughout history all over the world for healing, personal growth,
          spiritual development, and revealing hidden truths, such as in the
          Eleusinian Mysteries, Soma practices in Vedic India, and rituals in
          several South American indigenous cultures. Drawing on the plant
          intelligence work of Paul Stamets and Stephen Buhner, Grauer shows
          that the growth of individual and collective intelligence is hindered
          by the prohibition of psychedelics, which naturally foster humanity’s
          capacity for analysis, innovation, and cooperation. In addition to
          creating a sense of unity with all things, psychedelics offer the mind
          a new perspective from which to analyze its experience and heighten
          its awareness. Drawing on his own experience and research, Grauer
          provides guidelines for how to safely use natural plant/fungi
          psychedelics in order to access the unified consciousness of our
          ancestors and induce the states of awareness we need to restore
          natural harmony to our world.

          “In<i> Psychedelic Consciousness</i>, Daniel Grauer undertakes a
          highly ambitious assessment of the very nature of life itself, and of
          the countless tangulations, from physical to spiritual, that afflict
          humanity and promote suffering and misunderstanding. Taking us from
          early ancestry up through modern discovery, from single-cell life to
          complex society, he weaves a case for the employment of psychedelics
          as psychic crowbars capable of opening us to more life-affirming and
          expansive awareness.”
