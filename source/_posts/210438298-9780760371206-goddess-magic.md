            >Tune into the divine power of <i>Goddess Magic</i>, featuring a
            directory of deities alongside 50 spells, altars, and exaltations to
            amplify your highest vibes and attract fulfillment, success,
            friendship, growth, love, and fortune.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Goddesses, both new and old, will lend their powers to those who seek
          their favor. <i>Goddess Magic</i> helps you
          <b>channel divine power</b> while also helping you
          <b>find your patron deity</b> of choice.
          <b>Connect with your spiritual heritage</b> and tap into the powers of
          your ancestors and all the mystical beings around you.<br /><br />
          This beautiful handbook contains
          <b>well-known goddesses from the ancient world</b> famously claimed by
          witches throughout the ages as well as other, <b>less common ones</b>,
          like catholic patron saints, around whom specific spells and rituals
          have grown. Each goddess rules over her domain, protecting and
          inspiring those who seek her favor with traditional
          <b>rituals and spells</b> praising her. Her <b>symbols</b>,
          <b>favorite offerings</b>, and <b>favored forms of worship</b> are all
          explained in the same illustrated and informative way as the previous
          books in the series.<br /><br />
          Here is but a taste of the powerful patrons you can learn about:<br />
          &nbsp; <b>HECATE </b>is the Greek goddess of witchcraft and
          divination. Her roman counterpart is called <b>TRIVIA </b>and both
          accept offerings at crossroads. She transmits good news of the future,
          resides as a patron deity over divination spells. She’s an excellent
          guide for new ventures and is a powerful guardian. <b>KAMALA </b>is an
          incarnation of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and
          creativity. Invoke her to bring creative skills so that you can fill
          your life with pleasure and wealth of every kind by offerings of rice
          and ghee. <b>MARIE LAVEAU </b>may be the most influential American
          practitioner of the magical arts. The notorious Voudou Queen of New
          Orleans dispensed charms and potions (even saving several condemned
          men from the gallows), told fortunes, and healed the sick.
          <b>SAINT LUCIA</b> is the bearer of light in the darkness of winter.
          She is the patron saint of the blind, authors, cutlers, glaziers,
          laborers, martyrs, peasants, saddlers, salesmen, and stained glass
          workers. <b>YEMAYA</b> is the Yorùbá Orisha or Goddess of the living
          Ocean, considered the mother of all. She is the source of all the
          waters, including the rivers of western Africa, especially the River
          Ogun. She is associated with the Orisha Olokin (Who is variously
          described as female, male, or hermaphrodite), Who represents the
          depths of the Ocean and the unconscious, and together They form a
          balance. She is the sister and wife of Aganju, the God of the soil,
          and the mother of Oya, Goddess of the winds. <br /><b
