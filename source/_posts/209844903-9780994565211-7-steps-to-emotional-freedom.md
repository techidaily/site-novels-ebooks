            It was when I realised that there was so much more to life than just
            going to work and paying the bills that life began to alter
            significantly for me. I realised I have a gift to help other women
            develop and move forward no matter what their circumstances were.
            When you acknowledge there are some life experiences that are
            holding you back and you are truly ready for change then the full
            impact of Emotional Freedom is absolutely enlightening. This is when
            your life will change from within. Unless you experience this then
            it’s hard to comprehend. People say that they feel lighter or now
            understand themselves from within. It is something that simply can
            only be experienced to understand the shift of clarity, life, love
            and happiness that will enter your life. Donna is an author, a
            facilitator, a coach and has an understanding of key techniques to
            unlock your blocks in life. Donna’s life experiences from being in a
            Domestic Violence relationship and having to re-build her life from
            nothing, gives her the vision to create better opportunities for
            women. Having a real understanding of confidence levels being
            depleted and how to re-establish confidence with her rapid success
            techniques. Donna works with women all over Australia and looking at
            adopting her practices overseas. Currently working with women who
            want to achieve more in life and release any blocks or limitations
            they are currently experiencing, Corporate entities with
            opportunities to help women in business achieve higher results and
            remove any pre-conditioned limitations, and schools to help those
            young&nbsp; women develop strong values to enter adult life with
            confidence, after all they are who will become our future leaders.
          </p>

            Donna’s passion also allows her to give back to the community where
            she donates to organisations in need of financial assistance.
            Whether that is for charities or not for profit businesses, Donna
            works with a number of organisations.
