          Deepak Chopra presents ten lessons to help build awareness and change
          the distorted energy patterns that are the root cause of aging,
          infirmity, and disease.<br /><br />Fifteen years after his #1
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Ageless Body, Timeless Mind</i>,
          Deepak Chopra revisits "the forgotten miracle"–the body's infinite
          capacity for change and renewal. You cannot take advantage of this
          miracle, Chopra says, unless you are willing to completely reinvent
          your body, transforming it from a material object to a dynamic,
          flowing process. "Your physical body is a fiction," Chopra contends.
          Every cell is made up of two invisible ingredients: awareness and
          energy.<br /><br />Transformation can't stop with the body, however;
          it must involve the soul. The soul–seemingly invisible, aloof, and
          apart from the material world–actually creates the body. Only by going
          to the level of the soul will you access your full potential, bringing
          more intelligence, creativity, and awareness into every aspect of your
          life.<br /><br /><i>Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul</i>
          delivers ten breakthroughs–five for the body, five for the soul–that
          lead to self-transformation. In clear, accessible terms, Chopra shows
          us how to commit ourselves to deeper awareness, focus on relationships
          instead of consumption, embrace every day as a new world, and
          transcend the obstacles that afflict body and mind.<br /><br />Deepak
          Chopra has inspired millions with his profound teachings over the
          years. His bestselling books have explored the mind/body connection
          and the power of spirit. With his latest book, he invites you to
          experience with him the miracles that unfold when we connect the body
          directly to the awesome mysteries that give life meaning–directly to
          the soul. When you have completed this journey, after reinventing your
          body and resurrecting your soul, the ecstasy of true wholeness becomes
          possible for the very first time.<i><br /></i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          "Alternative medicine guru Chopra, author of more than 50
          books,&nbsp;argues that the bond between body and soul has been
          severed; it's his hope that humankind is about to embark on a
          restoration project that will give the soul the attention it deserves.
          Chopra presents five 'breakthroughs' that address the body and five
          that address the soul. He also walks readers through a fascinating
          discussion of how energy affects spiritual and physical health, and
          includes a scored personal energy efficiency quiz. According to
          Chopra, when 'subtle energy' becomes blocked, awareness can act like
          an invisible force that turns unhealthy energy around (he also
          explains how the expression of genes can be altered by lifestyle
          changes). Chopra encourages readers to follow their inner guidance, to
          embrace a journey to higher consciousness, to expand awareness through
          meditation and other methods, to ask for guidance and then wait for it
          to appear, and to trust their instincts. By accepting the over-arching
          power of the 'invisible' or non-physical world, Chopra maintains that
          we can begin to nourish a state of wholeness in which there is no
          longer a disconnect between body, mind, and soul. Though Chopra offers
          10 'simple steps' to wholeness (including focusing on relationships
          instead of consumption), this is a multilayered text to savor and
          study; readers will continue to contemplate the author's message long
          after the final page is turned." <br /><b

          begin in our consciousness, so awareness is the first step in healing.
          In <i>Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul</i>, Deepak Chopra
