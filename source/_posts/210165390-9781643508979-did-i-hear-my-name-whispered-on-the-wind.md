            This book was written from the point of helping people of all walks
            of life.Remember, just one of life's little details can change
            life's meaning. The power of faith, the power of love, and the power
            of the human spiritâ€“they are as far apart as they can be in this
            life. Yet it's these three elements that when combined can change
            who you are and what you can be.There is an expression through
            mortal eyes, and it is based on this fact and is true. The whole of
            the human race must realize that they can only look at life through
            mortal eyes. You would be surprised not only at what you would see
            but also at what you would encounter if you allow yourself to be
            immersed in your life's story. As you read this book and mix with
            humanity, you will see that there are a great many people that are
            handicapped. Some of the handicaps are visibly. Other are not so
            visible. A great many people may need someone like you to reach out
            and share yourself with them. Help someone open the door to his or
            her full potential! Help them not feel awkward or uncomfortable when
            they share a story or a joke. It may not be funny to you, but laugh
            anyway, or at least smile. There is no tax or charge.Life is full of
            opportunities to share yourself, from family members to friends or
            just an acquaintance. Make it a goal to give someone a hug today.
            Tell someone you love them every day. Remember that it takes great
            courage to expose the real self. Allow yourself the opportunity to
            get to know the greatest person in your earthly life: yourself.
