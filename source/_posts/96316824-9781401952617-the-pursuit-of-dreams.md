            >Everyone deserves to make their dreams a reality. What dreams of
            yours have you deferred for too long?</b
          >
          <br /><br />It’s all too common for our passions to fall by the
          wayside amongst the daily grind of ordinary living. Are you ready to
          take one step today toward answering your heart’s calling and
          fulfilling your destiny?<br /><br />In <i>The Pursuit of Dreams</i>,
          <b>Dr. Dragos</b> shares the deeply personal experience of how he
          accomplished his dreams —including traveling to the North and South
          Poles without any money or connections —to show how <i>you</i> can
          reclaim your power and take charge of your life by listening to the
          voice of Truth. <br /><br />Travel the world with Dr. Dragos, go
          behind the scenes in Silicon Valley and NASA headquarters, and meet an
          eclectic cast of characters, including a Buddhist teacher, a
          Freemason, an Army veteran, a monk from Transylvania, an innovator at
          Google, and a NASA legend. Their fascinating conversations connect
          science, spirituality, and entrepreneurship to inspire and empower you
          to realize your dreams.

          "In this engaging book, Dr. Dragos Bratasanu shows us that science is
          the contemporary language of spirituality. Read it, and you will learn
          that everything in your life is an initiation to your true
          potential—and pain and suffering, when you apply your will to move
          through difficult experiences, is the birthing process of wisdom. The
          Pursuit of Dreams teaches us that when we trust ourselves and fully
          surrender, our dreams will come true."<br />— Dr. Joe Dispenza, New
          York Times best-selling author of Becoming Supernatural and You Are
          the Placebo<br /><br />"The Pursuit of Dreams is the container for an
          elegant code. It’s an advanced and consciousness-shifting ‘mind-ware’
          that can breathe life into your greatest dreams and life’s
          passions."<br />— Gregg Braden, New York Times best-selling author of
          Human by Design and The Divine Matrix<br /><br />"Dr. Dragos stands
          for the hopeless, for the ones who starve for more meaning and
          purpose, for the rejected and the lonely. The genius of Dr. Dragos
          makes us clearly see that beyond our suffering, doubts, and problems
          that we face in life, there is a place in our hearts where courage,
          hope, and love still make our dreams possible."<br />— Guy Djoken, CEO
          and executive director of UNESCO Center for Peace<br /><br />"[Dragos
          is] an exceptionally creative and forward-thinking fellow who knows
          how to . . . produce excellent results."<br />— Dr. Guy André Boy,
          NASA chief scientist, professor at Florida Institute of Technology,
          and fellow of the Academy of Air &amp; Space<br /><br />"Dragos is one
          of those gifted contributors who is practicing what he is preaching.
          Maybe this explains his instant transformative effect on his
          audiences."<br />— Cristian Onetiu, entrepreneur in the Forbes Top 500
          and start-ups mentor
