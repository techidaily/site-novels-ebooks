            For the first time, the three great magical works of King Solomon
            are together in one volume. The Greater and Lesser Keys give a
            practical guide to the operation of his magic. The testament gives a
            historical account of its use by Solomon himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Key of Solomon the King was originally researched and translated
            by S.L. MacGregor Mathers from ancient manuscripts in the British
            museums. Included by Mathers is the Order of the Pentacles of
            Solomon, the Ancient Fragment of the Key of Solomon, The Qabalistic
            Invocation of Solomon, and 15 plates full of figures, seals and
            charts, as well as the original text giving detailed instruction for
            spells and invocations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work is traditionally divided into two books detailing the Key
            of King Solomon. Book One explains the operation of conjurations,
            curses, spells and other magical works. Book Two instructs the
            practitioner on the proper attire, purification rituals and other
            means of obtaining the goals of the Goetia. Between these two books
            is the list of plates that contain numerous illustrations and secret
            seals of Solomon, including the Mystical Seal of Solomon, the
            Pentacles of Solomon, and the Mystical Alphabet, which impart the
            mechanisms and requirements for the invocation of spirits and
            demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lesser Key of Solomon, or the Clavicula Salomonis Regis, or
            Lemegeton, is a compilation of materials and writings from ancient
            sources making up a text book of magic or “grimoire.” Portions of
            this book can be traced back to the mid-16th to 17th centuries, when
            occult researchers such as Cornelius Agrippa and Johannes
            Trithemisus assembled what they discovered during their
            investigations into their own great works.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a modern grimoire, the Lesser Key of Solomon has seen several
            editions with various authors and editors taking liberty to edit and
            translate the ancient writings and source material. In 1898, Arthur
            Edward Waite published his The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts,
            which contained large portions of the Lemegeton. He was followed by
            Mathers and Crowley in 1904 who published The Goetia: The Lesser Key
            of Solomon.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the preface to this edition, it is explained that a “Secret
            Chief” of the Rosicrucian Order directed the completion of the book.
            The original editor was a G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F. who translated ancient
            texts from French, Hebrew, and Latin, but was unable to complete his
            labors because of the martial assaults of the Four Great Princes.
            Crowley was then asked to step in and finish what the previous
            author had begun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Testament of Solomon is a pseudepigraphical work attributed to
            King Solomon the Wise of the Old Testament. Written in the
            first-person narrative, the book tells the story of the creation of
            the magical ring of King Solomon and how Solomon’s ring was used to
            bind and control demons, including Beelzebub. In this book of King
            Solomon, the discourses between the King and the various spirits are
            told, and the story shows how Solomon uses his wisdom to withstand
            the demons’ tricks and guile and enlist their aid in the building of
            his temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            The manuscripts from which this work was discovered date from the
            15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. All were written in Greek. This
            dating makes most experts believe that the work is medieval. But
            some scholars, including D.C. Duling, argue that it is likely that
            the work comes from the 5th or 6th centuries.
