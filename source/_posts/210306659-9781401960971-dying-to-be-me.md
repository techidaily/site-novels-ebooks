          In this truly inspirational memoir, Anita Moorjani relates how, after
          fighting cancer for almost four years, her body began shutting
          down—overwhelmed by the malignant cells spreading throughout her
          system. As her organs failed, she entered into an extraordinary
          near-death experience where she realized her inherent worth . . . and
          the actual cause of her disease. Upon regaining consciousness, Anita
          found that her condition had improved so rapidly that she was released
          from the hospital within weeks—without a trace of cancer in her body!
          <br /><br />Within these pages, Anita recounts stories of her
          childhood in Hong Kong, her challenge to establish her career and find
          true love, as well as how she eventually ended up in that hospital bed
          where she defied all medical knowledge. As part of a traditional Hindu
          family residing in a largely Chinese and British society, Anita had
          been pushed and pulled by cultural and religious customs since she was
          a little girl. After years of struggling to forge her own path while
          trying to meet everyone else’s expectations, she had the realization,
          as a result of her epiphany on the other side, that she had the power
          to heal herself . . . and that there are miracles in the Universe that
          she’d never even imagined. <br /><br />In <i>Dying to Be Me</i>, Anita
          freely shares all she has learned about illness, healing, fear, "being
          love," and the true magnificence of each and every human being! This
          is a book that definitely makes the case that we are spiritual beings
          having a human experience . . . and that we are all One!

          "I have been deeply and profoundly touched by the contents of this
          book, and even more so by my personal relationship with Anita
          Moorjani, who came into my life through a series of Divinely
          orchestrated coincidences." -&nbsp;<b>Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</b
          ><br /><br />"Describing her ensuing near-death experience as a realm
          of clarity and expansiveness, 'a state of being,' Moorjani made the
          choice to return, and her rapid and remarkable recovery defies all
          medical understanding.&nbsp; Her psychospiritual healing, which
          continues to this day, was self-realization: of her own magnificence,
          of oneness with universal energy and with a universe comprising. This
          candid memoir is a cathartic testimony to the magnificence and healing
          capacity of every human being."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i
          ><br /><br />"This book is very thought provoking. Can we take the
          learnings, and make the changes, from someone else's Near Death
          Experience? Can I create for myself the same level of faith and
          knowing just by reading this book? Honestly, I don't think I can. But
          what I can do is open my mind that little bit more, take this book as
          another brick in building that wall of strength, and take her
          learnings with me on my own journey. I recommend that you do that
          same." -&nbsp;<b>Rachel Bell</b><br /><br />"I had the pleasure of
          reading Anita's book after hearing her speak in Sydney, Australia at
          the end of January. Her NDE experience is profound. The wisdom she
          shares is life changing." -&nbsp;<b>Cheryl Richardson</b
          ><br /><br />"This book reminded me how important it is to&nbsp;live
          life from a place of passion rather than from a place of fear.&nbsp;No
          matter what challenge life gives us, it's really important to look for
          the gift in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; This book is truly amazing." - Vibrant

        </h4>
        <p>
          Anita Moorjani was born in Singapore of Indian parents, moved to Hong
          Kong at the age of two, and lived in Hong Kong until she moved to the
          United States in 2015. Because of her background and British
          education, she is multilingual and grew up speaking English,
          Cantonese, and an Indian dialect simultaneously. Anita worked in the
          corporate world for many years before being diagnosed with cancer in
          April 2002.<br />
          Her fascinating and moving near-death experience (NDE) in early 2006
          tremendously changed her perspective on life, and her work is now
          ingrained with the depths and insights she gained while in the other
          realm. She, and her miraculous story, were discovered by Dr Wayne Dyer
          who fostered her entrance into the world of public speaking, and urged
          her to write a book about her experience. And following his lead,
          Anita wrote her first book, Dying to be Me, and it reached the New
          York Times Best Seller list. Since then her two other books "What if
          this is Heaven" and "Sensitive is the New Strong" have reached
          significant acclaim. As a result of her NDE, Anita is often invited to
          speak at conferences and events around the globe to share her
          insights. From her Social Media channels to her live workshops, Anita
          demonstrates that she is the embodiment of the truth that we all have
          the inner power and wisdom to overcome even the most adverse
          situations.<br />
          Anita currently lives in California with her husband, and together
          they continue to share the messages that mean most to Anita through
          her books, social media platforms, online Sanctuary and retreats and
          workshops. Today, Anita is a contemporary activist for love and peace,
          sharing what she learned on the other side through her videos, books,
          and speeches.
