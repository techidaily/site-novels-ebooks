            Although Chloe Elizabeth endured childhood sexual trauma, she does
            not consider herself a victim or even a survivor of incest abuse.
            Rather, she considers herself a victor, a champion. Even so, she has
            felt, as many who have experienced similar trauma, that she was once
            shattered into a million pieces by the abuse, then scattered into a
            million places. It has taken a lifetime to regather the pieces,
            reassemble them, and redeem her life. First, Chloe took back
            control, and then she took back her life. Her efforts resulted in a
            miracle. Chloe's hard work with definite intent created for herself
            a life she could not imagine even in her wildest imagination was
            possible for her.After many years of recovery and healing, today
            Chloe considers herself sane and healthy. Her journey through
            recovery has demanded deliberate and determined effort necessary to
            pull herself out of a pit of miry clay and reclaim her life. Now she
            realizes that the painstaking effort required to recover has created
            much healing resulting in rich blessings in her life now, and
            lasting peace with her past. Today Chloe is empowered by her past.
            She understands the importance of every experience in her life,
            appreciating that each and every event was necessary to bring into
            existence the woman she is today.This is her story, courageously
            shared in hopes of inspiring others struggling as she has, that they
            too might find hope and healing for themselves. Recovery and healing
            has proven, without a doubt that Chloe is a gift, and nothing that
            can happen, or has happened can change that.
