              >From Christina Rasmussen, the much beloved and acclaimed author
              of&nbsp;<i>Second Firsts</i>, comes a&nbsp;groundbreaking
              exploration of the afterlife that combines spirituality with
              cutting edge science—and reveals we all have the power to connect
              with our loved ones on the other side.

          <p>
            “Where did you go?” This was the first question Christina Rasmussen
            asked after the death of her husband. A young widow with two
            daughters, Rasmussen would go on to become an esteemed grief
            educator who helped countless others rebuild their lives after loss.
            Yet, even as she learned to thrive again, that first heartbreaking
            question persisted. Even as she and her clients forged new paths and
            discovered new joy, the same questions remained: Are we capable of
            connecting to those who have passed on? What really happens after we
            die?
          </p>
          <p>
            As a professional grounded in science, Christina was a skeptic who
            shied away from the conventional mystical, supernatural, and
            religious descriptions of the afterlife—so she turned to what seemed
            “provable” to unravel the mystery of life beyond life: physics. What
            she found was beyond anything she could have expected: not only is
            there life after death, but we <i>all</i> have the ability to
            connect with loved ones who have passed on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharing an inspiring message of hope, optimism, and love,
            <i>Where Did You Go?</i> is a transporting step-by-step guide to
            journeying to the other side, from one of our most trusted voices on
            life after loss. Bridging the gap between the metaphysical and the
            measurable, it will change the way we grieve, the way we live and
            how we define our potential—in this life and the hereafter.
