          As a companion tool, this workbook includes further insight and
          activities to help process the principles outlined in Two on a Bridge,
          The Guidebook. These activities are designed to help access the
          different energy sources available to us and hopefully make them a
          part of oneâ€™s life. It is an essential tool that serves as a journal
          to reflect on thoughts and feelings as the reader and a partner
          dedicate time to meet and take a journey across the bridge. Over the
          course of the meetings, there are many opportunities to share goals,
          examine new ideas, and reflect on individual challenges. As in the
          Guidebook, the reader will discover the healing energy that can come
          from the power of two. About the Author: Linda L. Stampoulos lives in
