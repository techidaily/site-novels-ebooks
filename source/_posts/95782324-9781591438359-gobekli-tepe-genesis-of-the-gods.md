          An exploration of the megalithic complex at Göbekli Tepe, who built
          it, and how it gave rise to legends regarding the foundations of
          civilization <br />
          <br />• Details the layout, architecture, and exquisite carvings at
          Göbekli Tepe <br />
          <br />• Explores how it was built as a reaction to a global cataclysm
          <br />
          <br />• Explains that it was the Watchers of the Book of Enoch and the
          Anunnaki gods of Sumerian tradition who created it <br />
          <br />• Reveals the location of the remains of the Garden of Eden in
          the same region <br />
          <br />Built at the end of the last ice age, the mysterious stone
          temple complex of Göbekli Tepe in Turkey is one of the greatest
          challenges to 21st century archaeology. As much as 7,000 years older
          than the Great Pyramid and Stonehenge, its strange buildings and rings
          of T-shaped monoliths--built with stones weighing from 10 to 15
          tons--show a level of sophistication and artistic achievement
          unmatched until the rise of the great civilizations of the ancient
          world, Sumer, Egypt, and Babylon. <br />
          <br />Chronicling his travels to Göbekli Tepe and surrounding sites,
          Andrew Collins details the layout, architecture, and exquisite relief
          carvings of ice age animals and human forms found at this
          12,000-year-old megalithic complex, now recognized as the oldest stone
          architecture in the world. He explores how it was built as a reaction
          to a global cataclysm--the Great Flood in the Bible--and explains how
          it served as a gateway and map to the sky-world, the place of first
          creation, reached via a bright star in the constellation of Cygnus. He
          reveals those behind its construction as the Watchers of the Book of
          Enoch and the Anunnaki gods of Sumerian tradition. <br />
          <br />Unveiling Göbekli Tepe’s foundational role in the rise of
          civilization, Collins shows how it is connected to humanity’s creation
          in the Garden of Eden and the secrets Adam passed to his son Seth, the
          founder of an angelic race called the Sethites. In his search for
          Adam’s legendary Cave of Treasures, the author discovers the Garden of
          Eden and the remains of the Tree of Life--in the same sacred region
          where Göbekli Tepe is being uncovered today.

          massive cave complex beneath the Giza plateau, now known as “Collins’
