          A step-by-step guide to the occult science of sex magic <br />
          <br />• Based on the practices of P. B. Randolph, occult rival of H.
          P. Blavatsky <br />
          <br />• Reveals how to perform sex magic rituals for specific
          real-world results, such as greater strength or enhancement of the
          senses <br />
          <br />• Explains how to create magical talismans, such as rings with
          specific planetary forces, how to enliven a painting, and how to
          charge an effigy <br />
          <br />Conceived by Paschal Beverly Randolph, <i>Magia Sexualis</i> has
          been heralded as the most influential book about sex magic ever
          written, surviving to the present day solely through Maria de
          Naglowska’s French translation. Published more than 50 years after
          Randolph’s death, the authorship of this “translation” has been
          repeatedly called into question: While the greater part of the content
          can be traced to Randolph’s known works, a very significant portion
          cannot--leading to the conclusion that this work was supplemented by
          Naglowska’s own sex magic work and extensive occult teachings. <br />
          <br /><i>Magia Sexualis</i> explains Randolph’s meticulous science of
          sex magic, practiced by the Brotherhood of Eulis and the Hermetic
          Brotherhood of Light. Beginning with exercises to develop essential
          skills, the book explains in step-by-step detail how to perform sex
          magic rituals for specific results, such as greater strength or
          enhancement of the senses, how to charge and use a “volt”--an effigy
          of a specific person you want to influence or protect, how to enliven
          a painting in order to influence those around it, and how to create
          magical talismans with specific planetary forces, using what Randolph
          calls “fluid condensers.” This work from two great occult minds shows
          that true power of the spirit is acquired in conjunction with the
          power of sex--affirming that “sex is the fundamental force in every
          being, the most powerful force in Nature, and the most characteristic
          evidence of God.”

          “The practices contained in this work present an antidote to the
          disconnection of technology, the detachment of the corporeal and
          re-immerse the participant with the act they are engaging in. We can
          only hope, if people combat and remedy the removal of their souls from
          the actions of their bodies, it will spread to other areas of all of
          our lives.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825-1875) was an African American doctor,
          Rosicrucian, and occultist who introduced sex magic to North America.
          The founder of the Brotherhood of Eulis and a known occult rival of H.
          P. Blavatsky, he authored several books, including
          <i>Eulis: The History of Love</i>. Maria de Naglowska (1883-1936) was
          a Russian occultist, mystic, and founder of the Brotherhood of the
          Golden Arrow, whose conferences in Paris in the 1930s were attended by
          many now famous avant-garde and notorious writers and artists, such as
          Julius Evola, Man Ray, and André Breton. Donald Traxler is both a
          translator and student of the occult. He lives in Martinez,
          California.
