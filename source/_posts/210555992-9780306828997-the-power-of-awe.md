            >Discover a clinically proven way to reduce inflammation, stress,
            loneliness, and burnout&nbsp;</b

            >As lifelong meditators and mindfulness teachers, we confess we were
            almost embarrassed when we stumbled onto a 5–15 second shortcut to
            transcendence. &nbsp;This idea ran counter to everything we knew
            about meditation before we began our research. But, yes, it is
            possible. It only requires accessing the powerful emotion of awe in
            ordinary, everyday life. The changes in our lives have been
            profound, and after seeing the results repeated again and again in
            our thousands of patients, clients, and study participants, we’ve
            proven that our shortcut, coined the A.W.E. Method, works. </i
          ><br /><i>—</i>from the Preface<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Research has proven that mindfulness improves well-being and reduces
          stress, anxiety, and pain. But for some, the practice itself feels
          challenging and inaccessible. That’s where the A.W.E. Method comes in.
          In<i> The Power of Awe</i>, therapist Jake Eagle and chronic pain
          specialist Michael Amster, MD, share their extraordinary yet simple
          mindfulness practice that turns ordinary moments into awe-inducing
          experiences, helping you effortlessly achieve a heightened state of
          consciousness usually reserved for seasoned practitioners of
          mindfulness—all within a matter of seconds.<br /><br />
          A.W.E. stands for Attention, Wait, Exhale and Expand, and the method
          is a five- to fifteen-second, three-step process—a type of
          “microdosing mindfulness,” or a brief, informal mindfulness practice
          supported by research conducted at UC Berkeley. The A.W.E. Method
          quickly transports us into awe, an incredibly powerful emotion that
          produces wonderment and a heightened state of consciousness along with
          some remarkable changes in the mind and body that can improve health
          and wellness.<br /><br />
          Experiencing awe does not require any demanding discipline or skills
          or “awesome” settings. The A.W.E. Method ensures that awe and its many
          benefits are accessible to you at any time, in any place—sitting at a
          stoplight, cooking a meal, petting an animal, or listening to a loved
          one’s laugh.
