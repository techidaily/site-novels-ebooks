            Mariana's well-received book, Agartha - The Earth's Inner
            World,&nbsp;had just been released (2010) when she had a visitation
            from her cosmic friend and source of inspiration, Jan Frideg√•rd, who
            told her that he, too, had been to Agartha. He gave an account of
            his experiences there in the company of his dear friend and
            companion Lydia, whom we've met in a couple of previous books. They
            had also been on exciting adventures out in Space to the Pleiades,
            Sirius B, and Andromeda. Did Mariana wish to be his writing medium
            again? Of course!
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal"><br /></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal">
            In Agartha, they visit Porthologos, which houses a most
            extraordinary, gigantic library (with no books) that is several
            miles in length, wherein all human knowledge is contained. All one
            has to do is choose what one wishes to learn about, and in an
            instant, seemingly live holographic images appear, presenting the
            subject in question in a lifelike manner.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal"><br /></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal">
            In Agartha they meet the enigmatic Pilgrim, who imparts much of his
            immense wisdom to them and acts as their guide on several of their
            journeys. Among many other wonderfully fascinating places, they
            visit an intriguing research center, the Fortress, where notable
            inventions and discoveries evolve, and to which many eminent
            researchers from the surface world have been transferred, such as
            Darwin and Tesla.

            On the Pleiades (the Seven Sisters, containing many advanced
            Galactic Societies) no large cities exist, only very small
            communities in which virtually everyone knows one another and enjoys
            being in each other's company. Interesting accounts are given
            regarding the Pleiadean Parliament, their school system, and general
            way of living. Janne and Lydia also learn about its wildlife and sea
            people. Truly - this isn't a misprint - mermaids really do exist
            .... On Sirius B they make the acquaintance of a dolphin community,
            besides the amphibians - who have fish-suits. They further are
            privileged to experience a wondrously stupendous Evensong in the
            Ivory Cave.

            The journey ends in Andromeda, where all individuals are part of a
            higher consciousness, and life seems easy to live. They are shown
            healing houses, and even manage to visit a reptilian planet

          An energising read!!&nbsp;&nbsp; JJ Smith:"What a fabulous book,
          covering life in Agartha (Hollow Earth), Pleiades, Sirius and
          Andromeda ... and a reptilian planet!! Having read the authors other
          book "Agartha" I wanted, more ... and this one did not disappoint. It
          has certainly given me new insights and I'm looking forward to being
          5th dimensional so I can have some of these direct experiences for
          myself."

          Great book... P Dixson&nbsp; "Great book. I hope the concepts of a
          peaceful existence will apply to our planet real soon, I hope we can
          manifest these things."
