            >Astrologers use lunar eclipses for timing and prediction. Our birth
            charts reveal we belong to a heavenly family—a family of dragons, a
            family of galvanizing lunar eclipse patterns, many of which are
            ancient and have been returning for centuries. Get ready to meet
            your dragon family and discover life patterns unknowable by any

          ><br /><br />
          The ancient Chinese believed that lunar eclipse occurred when a dragon
          ate the moon. Our birth charts reveal we belong to a heavenly family—a
          family of dragons, or galvanizing lunar eclipse patterns, many of
          which are ancient and have been returning for centuries to check up on
          us, their earthly kin. Get ready to meet your dragon family and
          discover life patterns that have been dancing you through elaborate
          cosmic steps heretofore unknowable by any conventional means of
          astrological analysis.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Who wouldn’t want to dance with dragons? Nothing has captured their
          essence more than this book.<br />
          Who are these dragons?<br />
          Which Dragon family do you belong to?<br />
          Which Dragon owns the Astrological DNA of your soul?<br />
          How are Dragons influencing your life?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          If you’re looking for a precision instrument that is useful, reliable
          and will function 100 percent of the time, the forty-seven families of
          lunar eclipses outlined in this book have quite the stories to tell.
          Some are ancient, some are new, and some have yet to be born. But they
          each have the power to illuminate your sphere of influence. We all
          want to fulfill the highest, truest expression of ourselves as human
          beings and a knowledge of how these Lunar Saros Series eclipses work
          shines a special quality of light upon our personality and our pathway
          through the world. You will see how the eclipses have impacted lives
          and brought fame, fortune and sometimes despair. The author’s
          captivating humor takes the technical astrological data and makes it
          interesting to even those who are not astrology buffs.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Every Astrologer needs this book. It is as essential as the
          Ephemerides. It will make your practice come alive in ways you have
          never experienced.
