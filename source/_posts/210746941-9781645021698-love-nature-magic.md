              reflects on her surprising conversations with the spirits of the
              familiar plants and animals around us—and the knowledge they share
              with us.</strong

            In&nbsp;<strong>Love, Nature, Magic</strong>, organic advocate and
            former CEO of a global health and wellness company Maria Rodale
            combines her love of nature and gardening with her experience in
            shamanic journeying, embarking on an epic adventure to learn from
            plants, animals, and insects—including some of the most
            misunderstood beings in nature. Maria asks them their purpose and
            listens as they show and declare what they want us humans to know.
            From Thistles to Snakes, Poison Ivy to Mosquitoes, these nature
            beings convey messages that are relevant to every human, showing us
            how to live in balance and harmony on this Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through journeys filled with surprises, humor, and foibles, follow
            Maria’s evolution from resenting to accepting—and even falling in
            love with—our most difficult neighbors (including human ones).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Maria’s journeys include conversations with: Mugwort • Vulture •
              Bat • Rabbit • Lanternfly • Lightning Bug • Osage Orange • Deer •
              Paper Wasp • Dandelion • Tick • Groundhog • Milkweed • And
              more!</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout, Maria shares an essential truth that resonates across
            her shamanic explorations: We first must heal our own hearts, for
            only then can we truly love others and begin to heal planet Earth.
