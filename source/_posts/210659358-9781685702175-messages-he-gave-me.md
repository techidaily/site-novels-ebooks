            Joan Hope was born in Guyana in South America. She grew up in the
            Beterverwagting / Triumph area and attended elementary and high
            school in Georgetown.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In her first semester at Bishops' High, she attended the school's
            Bible Club meetings and there accepted Jesus as her Savior. She
            worshipped at Elim Pentecostal Church on Albert Street in
            Georgetown, was an active participant in the youth fellowship, and
            subsequently a part of the leadership. She loved to sing and became
            a member of the church choir.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            She married Hamlet Hope, and they have one son, Darrel. When her
            husband was offered a job at the College of the Bahamas, the family
            moved to Nassau, Bahamas. She attended Bahamas Faith Ministries and
            served with her husband, first as ushers and later as cell group
            pastors. She was a part of BFM's Woman of the Word and a member of
            the island's Women's Aglow Fellowship. As she attached herself to
            the women's groups, she became aware of her heart for Women's
            Ministry.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The family migrated to the USA and in Georgia, attended The Redeemed
            Christian Church of God, in Douglasville where she was a part of the
            Women's Ministry leadership.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Joan, a professional teacher for many years, was a lecturer in
            microbiology and head of the Medical Technology Department at the
            University of Guyana. In Nassau Bahamas, she was head of the Science
            Department at Kingsway Academy and taught Biology, Mathematics,
            Agriculture, and Health Science. She established and still
            coordinates the Vacation Bible School for Children in The Redeemed
            Christian Church of God, Praise Chapel, Georgia. Her zeal for
            teaching is reflected in her sermons.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            She is truly grateful to God for the opportunities afforded her over
            the years to be useful in various areas of His kingdom.
