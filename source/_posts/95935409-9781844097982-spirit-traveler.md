          “We have relied on science to tell us what happened in ancient sites
          around the world, it is time for research that is connected to
          Source.” --Sonja Grace "Spirit Traveler: Unlocking Ancient Mysteries
          and Secrets of Eight of the World’s Great Historic Sites" takes a
          unique approach to analyzing why famous historic sites, including the
          Great Pyramids, Stonehenge, and Tiwanaku, were constructed. Scientists
          and archaeologists have written thousands of books about these sites.
          While this information is crucial to our knowledge today, much of the
          mystery about these places remains unsolved and questions surrounding
          their purpose have lingered throughout the centuries. "Spirit
          Traveler", the companion book to the documentary film with the same
          title, offers a completely different perspective on why these sites
          were erected and what purpose they served. Only Sonja Grace, the
          internationally known mystic healer, is able to reveal the secrets of
          these ancient buildings in this new and fascinating way. Sonja is a
          Spirit Traveler deeply devoted to the protection of our beautiful
          Earth. She has spent a lifetime working in the ethers with angels and
          guides. She sheds light on what the people and cultures of the past
          were doing at these sites and why, offering a brand new understanding
          of the events that took place there centuries ago. Sonja Grace brings
          her unique understanding of the truth to history. In Spirit Traveler,
          Sonja travels back through the realms to reveal history as it
          happened. She answers the questions that have puzzled historians and
          archaeologists for hundreds of years: What was the purpose of
          Stonehenge? How were the Great Pyramids built, and why is their
          particular geometry so significant? Why was Skellig Rock so important
          to the monks? Have our beliefs about these great sites been wrong all
          along? Is their importance something other than what we have always
          thought? Sonja Grace’s discoveries shine a whole new light on our
          historical understanding of these places and on their relationships to
          the Earth. Sonja Grace aims to bring a new spiritual truth to these
          questions and fulfill her purpose in the awakening of humanity. Spirit
          Traveler is a purposefully structured book. Sonja discusses eight
          specific historical sites: Skellig Michael (Ireland) Tiwanaku - The
          Gate of the Sun (Bolivia) Stonehenge (England) Hagar Qim (Malta) St.
          Winifride’s Well (Wales) Chichen ltza and Temple of Kukulcan (Mexico)
          The Great Khafre Pyramids (Egypt) the Rock of Cashel (Ireland). Each
          chapter tackles the scientific and historical information available
          about each site up to this point in time. Sonja addresses the
          questions that continue to puzzle archaeologists and historians. The
          second half of each chapter is devoted to Sonja’s Spirit Traveler’
          experience, what she learned, and the answers to some of those
          longstanding questions. Few people possess the gifts of Sonja Grace.
          Her heritage (part Native American, part Norwegian) provides her with
          the extraordinary ability to transport anywhere. She sees, hears,
          smells and feels the places she visits. In Spirit Traveler, Sonja
          shares every single detail of her riveting travels through space and
          time. Her work is marked by her distinct understanding of the
          dimensions and realms along with the convergence of Divine and Earth
          energies, which allows her to travel through the ethers and gather
          historic information.
