            Sometimes illumination occurs spontaneously or, as Ram Dass
            experienced, in a heart-wrenching moment of opening. More commonly,
            it happens when we polish the mirror of the heart with daily
            practice—and see beyond the illusion of our transient thoughts and
            emotions to the vast and luminous landscape of our true nature.<br />For
            five decades, Ram Dass has explored the depths of consciousness and
            love and brought them to life as service to others. With
            <i>Polishing the Mirror</i>, he gathers together his essential
            teachings for living in the eternal present, here and now.<br />Readers
            will find within these pages a rich combination of perennial wisdom,
            humor, teaching stories, and detailed guidance on Ram Dass' own
            spiritual practices, including:<br />Bhakti Yoga—opening our hearts
            to unconditional lovePractices for living, aging, dying, and
            embracing the natural flow of lifeKarma Yoga—how selfless service
            can profoundly transform usWorking with fear and suffering as a path
            to grace and freedomStep-by-step guidance in devotional chant,
            meditation and mantra practice, and much more<br />For those new to
            Ram Dass' teachings, and for those to whom they are old friends,
            here is this vanguard spiritual explorer's complete guide to
            discovering who we are and why we are here, and how to become
            beacons of unconditional love.

          <b>Ram Dass</b><br /><b>Ram Dass</b> (1931–2019)first went to India in
          1967. He was still Dr. Richard Alpert, an already eminent Harvard
          psychologist and psychedelic pioneer with Dr. Timothy Leary. He
          continued his psychedelic research until his journey to the East in
          1967, driving overland to India, where he met his guru, Neem Karoli
          Baba, affectionately known as Maharaj-ji. Maharaj-ji gave him the
          name, Ram Dass, which means "servant of God." Everything changed
          then—his intense dharmic life started, and he became a pivotal
          influence on a culture that has reverberated with the words “be here
          now” ever since.<br /><i>Be Here Now,</i>&nbsp;Ram Dass's monumentally
          influential and seminal book, still stands as the highly readable
          centerpiece of the Western articulation of Eastern philosophy and
          practicing to live joyously in the present moment, be it luminous or
          mundane.&nbsp;From a backpackers’ bible in the 1970s,
          <i>Be Here Now</i>&nbsp;continues to be the instruction manual of
          choice for generations of spiritual seekers. Fifty years later, it's
          still part of the timeless present. Being here now is still being here
          now. Ram Dass's work continues to be a path of teaching and
          inspiration to so many. His loving spirit has been a guiding light for
          three generations, carrying millions along on the journey, helping
          free them from their bonds as he has worked through his own. For more
