          An exploration of Crowley’s relationship with the United States
          <br /><br />• Details Crowley’s travels, passions, literary and
          artistic endeavors, sex magick, and psychedelic experimentation
          <br /><br />• Investigates Crowley’s undercover intelligence
          adventures that actively promoted U.S. involvement in WWI
          <br /><br />• Includes an abundance of previously unpublished letters
          and diaries <br /><br />Occultist, magician, poet, painter, and writer
          Aleister Crowley’s three sojourns in America sealed both his notoriety
          and his lasting influence. Using previously unpublished diaries and
          letters, Tobias Churton traces Crowley’s extensive travels through
          America and his quest to implant a new magical and spiritual
          consciousness in the United States, while working to undermine
          Germany’s propaganda campaign to keep the United States out of World
          War I. <br /><br />Masterfully recreating turn-of-the-century America
          in all its startling strangeness, Churton explains how Crowley arrived
          in New York amid dramatic circumstances in 1900. After other travels,
          in 1914 Crowley returned to the U.S. and stayed for five years:
          turbulent years that changed him, the world, and the face of occultism
          forever. Diving deeply into Crowley’s 5-year stay, we meet artists,
          writers, spies, and government agents as we uncover Crowley’s complex
          work for British and U.S. intelligence agencies. Exploring Crowley’s
          involvement with the birth of the Greenwich Village radical art scene,
          we discover his relations with writers Sinclair Lewis and Theodore
          Dreiser and artists John Butler Yeats, Leon Engers Kennedy, and Robert
          Winthrop Chanler while living and lecturing on now-vanished “Genius
          Row.” We experience his love affairs and share Crowley’s hard times in
          New Orleans and his return to health, magical dynamism, and the most
          colorful sex life in America. We examine his controversial political
          stunts, his role in the sinking of the passenger ship
          <i>Lusitania</i>, his making of the “Elixir of Life” in 1915, his
          psychedelic experimentation, his prolific literary achievements, and
          his run-in with Detroit Freemasonry. We also witness Crowley’s
          influence on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and rocket fuel genius
          Jack Parsons. We learn why J. Edgar Hoover wouldn’t let Crowley back
          in the country and why the FBI raided Crowley’s organization in LA.
          <br /><br />Offering a 20th-century history of the occult movement in
          the United States, Churton shows how Crowley’s U.S. visits laid the
          groundwork for the establishment of his syncretic “religion” of
          Thelema and the now flourishing OTO, as well as how Crowley’s final
          wish was to have his ashes scattered in the Hamptons.

          “Crowley had a great hunger for almost everything he ever thought of
          or saw. He was economical with the truth, with his own money, and with
          his loyalties, but--and it is a big but--the scope and scale of
          America thrilled him. The vitality of the big cities, the newness and
          esoteric searching of the West Coast made him delirious with a big,
          greedy joy. He loved the States for nearly thirty years, as it gave
          him a dedicated group of very clever people, like Jack Parsons, who
          practiced what he preached. Tobias Churton has uncovered fresh
          material on Crowley in biographically fresh territory and has once
          again written a very fine book.”
