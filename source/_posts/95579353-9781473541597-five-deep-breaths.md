            ><br /><br />Every parent is doing the best they can, but there are
            times when it feels like nothing you do is ever good enough.
            Everyone seems to have an opinion and there’s no shortage of advice
            on how to be a better parent. Raising happy, confident, and
            resilient children is the most important job in the world – but in
            our fast-paced, twenty-first-century society, the challenges can
            feel overwhelming and exhausting: <br /><br />·

            <b
              >Are you struggling to navigate your child’s school pressures or
              the pitfalls of social media?</b
            ><br />· <b>Has your home become a combat zone?</b><br /><br />If
            you recognise any of these stress points, give yourself a break:
            this book <i>really</i> can help you.<br /><br />In
            <b><i>Five Deep Breaths</i></b
            >, clinical psychologist Dr Genevieve von Lob draws on her extensive
            experience with hundreds of families from all walks of life to
            provide simple, practical support for parents. Based on mindfulness,
            psychology and neuroscience, this reassuring guide will show you how
            to be kinder to yourself and trust your own judgement when dealing
            with dilemmas every parent faces. Examples based on real mums and
            dads show how to defuse tension, drama and anxiety in the home.
            Stressed-out parents will discover a sense of confidence, calm and
            balance – both for themselves and their children.

          I absolutely loved this book. The author really ‘gets’ the challenges
          of modern parenting and through her extensive contact with parents and
          hearing first-hand about their experiences, for the first time I
          really felt understood.

            dip into it any time I am feeling overwhelmed or stressed</b

          along this difficult parenting journey, full of useful, practical
          tips.
          <b
            >This book is about the power of mindfulness and self-awareness, and
            it’s so much more than that; it shows you how to develop a deeper
            connection with yourself and your child</b
          >
          – and leads you both on the path to resilience.
