            The Light of Egypt: The Science of the Soul and Stars by Thomas H.
            Burgoyne is a treatise on astrology, occultism, and the true nature
            of the universe. Comprising two volumes, this work explores the
            connection between the macrocosm of God and the microcosm of man.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Author Thomas H. Burgoyne was an occultist and medium, who believed
            he was in touch with the unembodied Brotherhood of Light. This
            group, Burgoyne and other followers believed, guided the fate of
            humanity from a different plane of existence. This book began as a
            set of lessons to share the Brotherhood's teachings with the public.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Burgoyne wrote Volume I of this work in the late 1880s, and
            published it in 1889. Shortly after its publication, he passed away
            at the age of 39. But he was not done with The Light of Egypt yet.
            After his passing, fellow occultists Henry and Belle Wagner
            continued his work. Belle Wagner succeeded Burgoyne as the scribe of
            the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. Burgoyne also chose Mrs. Wagner
            to be the vessel through which he would reveal Volume II of his
            great work. This is how the second volume of The Light of Egypt was
            written after Burgoyne's passing, and published in 1900.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Volume I explores the very foundations of existence, from the spirit
            to matter to creation. It then moves into the transitions of the
            soul, through the concepts of reincarnation, karma, and mediumship.
            Burgoyne explained that rather than reincarnating into another life
            here on Earth, true reincarnation brought the soul to a different,
            more elevated plane of existence. It was from this plane that he
            dictated the second volume of his work to Mrs. Wagner.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Key to Burgoyne's understanding of humanity and the universe is the
            study of astrology. By understanding the celestial bodies-the sun,
            moon, and eight planets (omitting Earth)-we could understand
            ourselves and the world around us in a new, truer way. Detailed
            descriptions of each of these bodies explain the way they interact
            both with each other and with the human brain. Volume I closes with
            a chapter regarding the practical applications of astrology, and how
            the date, time, and location of one's birth will determine mental
            and physical traits.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Volume II builds on the foundation laid in Volume I, and explains
            additional concepts of astrology as well as ritual magic and the
            occult. This volume explores astro-theology, using the science of
            the stars to understand the creation and redemption stories of world
            religions, including Christianity. It also discusses
            astro-mythology, drawing parallels between the symbolism of the gods
            and goddesses and the stars and constellations.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            A common theme through Volume II is understanding the true names and
            words used to symbolize the concepts described. The etymology of
            words like alchemy, talisman, and ritual are explored to help the
            reader understand their true original meaning, rather than the
            meaning we have ascribed to them in the centuries since their
            creation.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Volume II also contains a translation of the Tablets of Aeth, said
            to have been transcribed from the "Astral Records." These
            translations are in three parts: one to explore the symbolism of
            each of the twelve mansions, or zodiac houses; one to discuss the
            symbolism of the ten planetary rulers (the sun, moon, and eight
            planets); and one for "the Great Kabbalistic Powers." These 33
            tablets represent the very core of occult philosophy.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The work closes with the Penetralia, or "The Secret of the Soul," to
            bring everything together in a final call to enter the Sacred
            Sanctuary and learn the "imperishable truth of our being."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The Light of Egypt is a work to be carefully studied by students of
            astrology and the occult, to give them a deeper understanding of the
            universe and their place within it.
