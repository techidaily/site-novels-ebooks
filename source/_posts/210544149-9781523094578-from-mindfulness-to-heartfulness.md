          Millions have found mindfulness to be a powerful practice for reducing
          stress, enhancing attention, and instilling tranquility. But it can
          offer so much more—it can transform you, make you more fully awake,
          alive, and aware of your connection to all beings. In Japanese, the
          character that best expresses mindfulness, 念, consists of two
          parts—the top part, 今, meaning “now,” and the bottom part, 心,
          meaning “heart.” Using stories from his own life as the son of an
          Irish father and a Japanese mother, a professor in Japan and America,
          a psychotherapist, a father, and a husband, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu
          describes eight “heartfulness” principles that help us realize that
          the deepest expression of an enlightened mind is found in our relation
          to others.<br /><br /><b

            story is a jewel, opening the heart. He connects heartfulness to

          “From Mindfulness to Heartfulness is a rare gem—beautifully written,
          deeply engaging, and filled with valuable and authentic teachings
          about practical and spiritual paths toward balance and understanding.
          As Murphy-Shigematsu embraces his vulnerability, he opens up to and
          reflects upon his life stories, and that can inspire us to do the
          same—encouraging us toward knowledge and understanding. Just what is
          needed to bring the increasingly popular mindfulness approach back to
          its reality core—the blending of heartfulness with mindfulness.”<br />—Richard
          Katz, PhD, Professor Emeritus, First Nations University of Canada, and
          author of Indigenous Healing Psychology<br /><br />“Through tender
          teaching stories and an insightful narrative, Stephen
          Murphy-Shigematsu shows us the ways we can weave together mindfulness
          and compassion into what he terms heartfulness. As master educator, he
          leads us through the stages of heartfulness from vulnerability and
          connectedness to acceptance and gratitude. This is an important book.
          I heartfully recommend it to all who want to join their own personal
          journey of self-discovery to selfless service and the care for
          others.”<br />—Arthur&nbsp;Zajonc, Professor of Physics Emeritus,
          Amherst College, and former President, Mind and Life Institute<br /><br />“This
          book has the potential for radical change in the way we live together,
          and I loved reading it!&nbsp;Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu&nbsp;takes us
          beyond mindfulness as it is often currently taught—as an instrument
          for cognitive changes like focus, attention, or stress relief—to the
          truths of the gentle, appreciative, nurturing heart. He shows us
          through stories and practices how to expand our contemplative lives
          from being self-focused to being inclusive, connected, compassionate,
          and responsible. Immense heartfulness shines through every story he
          tells, drawing on experiences from teaching children and college
          students to being with his dying grandmother to his own biracial
          childhood. Each story is a jewel, opening the heart. He connects
          heartfulness to social justice, leadership, and education and offers
          simple, direct instructions for seven heartful practices.”<br />—Mirabai
          Bush, Senior Fellow, The Center for Contemplative Mind in Society, and
          author of Compassion in Action&nbsp;(with Ram Dass)
          and&nbsp;Contemplative Practices in Higher Education&nbsp;(with Daniel
          Barbezat)<br /><br />“This powerful book is full of love and intimate
          wisdom. Full of rich stories and deep guidance, it is also a map of
          the human heart and the best in all of us.”<br />—Roshi Joan Halifax,
          PhD, Abbot, Upaya Institute and Zen Center<br /><br />“Resonant with
          Stephen's kindness, heartfulness, and wisdom and filled with excellent
          exercises and practical guides, this lovely volume will be a friend
          and guide to all those intent on creating and sustaining thriving
          lives, workplaces, relationships, and communities.”<br />—Dan
          Barbezat, Professor of Economics, Amherst College<br /><br />“A
          profound and wise book written by a respected colleague and friend . .
          . this book humbly reminds us that mindfulness without the
          heart&nbsp;is lacking and shows the way to live our lives with
          awareness, compassion, and responsibility.”&nbsp;<br />—Frederic
          Luskin PhD, cofounder of LifeWorks, Stanford University, and author of
          Forgive for Good<br /><br />“I couldn't put this book down! Dr.
          Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu's From Mindfulness to Heartfulness is a
          profound exploration in heartful connection with ourselves and others.
          Through moving storytelling, Murphy-Shigematsu offers several integral
          components to cultivating a heartful way of being. Drawing on examples
          from his college teaching, his many talks to corporations and public
          audiences, and vulnerable moments from his own life, Murphy-Shigematsu
          illustrates what this heartful journey might look like—he is in it
          with us.&nbsp;He models the vulnerability heartfulness calls for,
          exploring the fraught experience of living a biracial identity in the
          racial contexts of both the United States and Japan. The insights that
          result offer a model of compassionate transformation that are
          applicable in a variety of contexts, including social justice,
          education, health care, corporations, and community work.<br />
          “This book is accessible, mesmerizing, and practical, offering both
          deep insights to ponder for days and practical tips to enact right
          now. It promises to become a classic mindfulness resource.”<br />—Beth
          Berila, PhD, RYT 500, Director, Women's Studies Program, St. Cloud
          State University<br /><br />“Master listener Dr. Murphy-Shigematsu
          demonstrates his attunement to the needs of a multicultural and
          stress-filled world by distilling wisdom stories from a range of
          perspectives to illuminate the holistic dynamics of heartfulness. His
          intimate stories exemplify how to live with heartfulness. They inspire
          and empower us to heal through a mindful awareness that plumbs the
          personally and socially transformative power of heartfulness.”
          <br />—Paula Arai, PhD, Associate Professor, Harvard University, and
          author of Women Living Zen and Bringing Zen Home<br /><br />“The focus
          is not on how you can reduce stress through mindfulness but on
          teachings that sensitively and carefully show us a valuable way that
          humans can live good lives.” <br />—Roshi Nanrei Yokota, Enkaku-ji Zen
          Temple Master <br /><br />“A moving testament and sharing of the
          lessons learned from the author's grandmother, the daughter of a
          samurai, who taught him the art of living with heartfulness. The book
          is the distillation of many years of searching for authenticity,
          making peace with his vulnerabilities, exploring his connectedness
          with others, and finding his unique purpose in life. I am deeply moved
          by his stories of integrating the American and Japanese values and his
          insights on achieving mindfulness. The exercises in the book are a
          helpful guide for us to find our own meaning in our lives.”
          <br />—Reiko Homma-True, Professor Emerita, Alliant International
          University<br /><br />“Murphy-Shigematsu, through vivid and insightful
          storytelling, shows how our connections to our ethnic and cultural
          heritage can guide and enrich our search for both enlightenment and
          social justice.&nbsp;The beautiful stories here bring vivid color to
          the practice of mindfulness that may seem like a world of whiteness in
          which race and culture are dismissed as worldly distractions on the
          spiritual journey.” <br />—Satsuki Ina, PhD, filmmaker,
          psychotherapist, and community activist <br /><br />“Dr.
          Murphy-Shigematsu's book offers an insightful new perspective on
          practicing mindfulness to cultivate heartful interconnections instead
          of just using it for stress reduction. This book is a timely and a
          much-needed intervention/response to corporate mindfulness. Using
          cultural and personal stories, Dr. Murphy-Shigematsu offers a moving
          narrative account of cultivating compassionate wisdom by opening our
          heart to listen to stories in and around our lives. The book is
          moving, wonderful, and heartfelt and an excellent guide to fully
          engaging in life with our heart.”<br />—Ramaswami Mahalingam,
          Professor of Psychology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor
          <br /><br />“Wisdom of the heart. Murphy-Shigematsu's gentle
          storytelling deftly illustrates a compassionate centering to the
          mindfulness movement sweeping across the country. In sharing the
          wisdom of his grandmother, he reminds us that outward-focused love and
          compassion are the complements to inward-focused peace and clarity.
          Significantly, this recentering is developed through stories that are
          cross-cultural and intercultural, illustrating how heartfulness
          provides compassionate pathways for navigating increasingly diverse
          societies. A valuable book.”<br />—Anthony Lising Antonio, Associate
          Professor of Education, Stanford University<br /><br />“In a society
          where supposed ‘intelligence' is measured by a person's ability to
          analyze and compute, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu reminds us that the
          depth of our humanity is more than a number, an algorithm, or a test
          score. In a powerful story only he can tell, Stephen shows us a
          workable path that crosses cultures, boundaries, and identities that
          stitches a broken world back together.”<br />—Jeremy Hunter, PhD,
          Founding Director, Executive Mind Leadership Institute, Peter F.
          Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management<br /><br />“Mindfulness
          has become a contemporary cliché, all too often taken far from its
          roots to be practiced in ways that exemplify the very problems of
          solipsism and disregard it was meant to transform. Encouraging us
          instead toward heartfulness, Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu returns us to
          the importance of presence, empathy, and compassion. With humor,
          humility, and vulnerability, he guides us back toward thinking of how
          we might live, work, and act together in diverse and inclusive
          communities.”<br />—Jeff Chang, author of We Gon' Be Alright<br />&nbsp;<br />“Murphy-Shigematsu
          is a master of storytelling. By artfully weaving together personal
          threads of his bicultural upbringing with accessible spiritual
          practices informed by Buddhism and modern psychotherapy, he becomes
          our friend and Sherpa, guiding us to reaching our highest human
          potential. Heartfulness is a life-changing philosophy of life,
          intended to heal not only individuals but communities at large.
          Reading this book will make you a better person.”<br />—Isabel Stenzel
          Byrnes, hospice worker and coauthor (with Anabel Stenzel) of The Power
