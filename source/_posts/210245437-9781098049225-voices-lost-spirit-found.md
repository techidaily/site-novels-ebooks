            One of my mother's favorite lines is "if you don't have anything
            nice to say, don't say anything at all." The principle still rings
            true, but there's a difference between being nice and being taken
            advantage of. We sometimes find it difficult to say no. Whatever the
            reason we can't say no, I'm here to tell us that we can. We can
            change our situations if we determine that we are ready to. If you
            are ready for change, I hope that you will engross yourself on this
            journey of finding your voice.This workbook is meant for anyone who
            feels beaten down by life. Jesus knows all about you. He is calling
            you to draw closer to Him and receive His Spirit. He will fill you
            with a boldness that you have never known (Ephesians 1:18). He
            already gave you the strength to go through this process (Isaiah
            41:10). You are never alone. God is everything you need.During this
            process, God will reveal things to us that we couldn't see before.
            We all have mountaintop and valley experiences. He promises to be
            with us through them all. This workbook will also help us to
            understand the people around us but use this workbook to understand
            you first. We need to be able to heal in order to help others.Voices
            Lost, Spirit Found takes you through a journey of discovering some
            reasons for repressed emotions. Revealing some unhealthy coping
            mechanisms is the next step. The final step is to give some healthy
            coping mechanisms to replace the unhealthy ones. I know you don't
            like where you are because you're looking for answers. I pray you
            find the answers through this workbook and prayer. This workbook
            gives you food for thought and space for your own thoughts and
            prayers.
