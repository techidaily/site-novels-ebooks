          How can we increase the likelihood that people will be able to control
          their wandering mind, let go of upsetting thoughts and feelings, and
          apply the wisdom of mindfulness training to their day-to-day lives?
          Mindfulness in a Busy World offers a bridge between the ancient wisdom
          of Eastern mindfulness teachings and the busy Western lifestyle of the
          tech era where an increasing number of people experience stress,
          anxiety, impatience, and an inability to be present in meaningful
          interactions. While traditional practices offer incredible
          possibilities of well-being and development, many people struggle to
          access these states of mind and ripen the skills to sustain them. This
          book offers insights into ways of mobilizing the brain’s attention
          systems so that distracted minds—often habituated to the constant
          overstimulation of screens and media—can more readily cultivate focus,
          calm, and kindness. Our society invests years in instructing people
          how to read, write, count, and think critically, but often forgets to
          support the crucial foundation of these abilities: focusing the mind.
          Learning to tame the mind allows people of all ages to live a more
          fulfilling life, balancing being and doing, thinking and feeling,
          listening and talking, compassion for self and others, and being an
          individual while belonging to a community.<br /><br /><br /><br />Distinctive
          features of this book:<br /><br /><br /><br />Brain-based strategies
          that render a focused mind within reach of everyday people<br /><br />Unique
          set of 18 breathing methods and over 27 other types of exercises which
          can quickly reset an agitated body or distracted mind<br /><br />Activities
          that make visible the remarkable powers of the mind to create and
          dissipate experiences of emotional or physical discomfort
          <br /><br />Specific strategies to facilitate inner peace and
          emotional regulation<br /><br />Simple but fascinating challenges—only
          achievable through mindfulness—that will leave people in awe of what
          their minds can do<br /><br />Intriguing collection of pain tolerance
          tests making it exciting to engage in the practices<br /><br />Mindfulness
          exercises that move beyond individual well-being and extend to a felt
          sense of belonging to a diverse community <br /><br />Inventive ways
          of bringing forth kindness, compassion, and gratitude<br /><br />Engaging
          metaphors and fascinating facts that ignite people’s curiosity about
          little known aspects of their physiology and help them connect to
          their bodies<br /><br />Words of wisdom, meaningful stories, inspiring
          quotes, and thought-provoking questions that help participants apply
          mindfulness practices to real life situations

          In a world with so many distractions all vying for our attention it
          should come as no surprise that there is a dramatic uptick in students
          and adults at all age levels struggling with their inability to focus,
          listen, and calm down. Utilizing her training in Mindfulness Based
          Stress Reduction, her clinical practice and her familiarity with
          neurobiological advances, Dr. Beaudoin, and co-author K. Maki, offer a
          detailed curriculum to facilitators and educators who are struggling
          to cope with this attention deficit. It is replete with creative
          mindfulness, breathing, and body exercises that offer opportunities
          for class participants "to discover in themselves, and experience
          first hand the unknown capacities of their minds.
