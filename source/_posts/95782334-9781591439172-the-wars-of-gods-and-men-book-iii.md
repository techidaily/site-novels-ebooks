          <i>The Earth Chronicles</i> series, in six voumes, deals with the
          history and prehistory of Earth and humankind. Each book in the
          series, based upon information written on clay tablets by the ancient
          civilizations of the Near East, records the fantastic and real battles
          that occurred between the original creator gods over control of planet
          Earth. Asserting the premise that mythology is not fanciful but the
          repository of ancient memories, <i>The Earth Chronicles</i> series
          suggests that the Bible ought to be read literally as a
          historic/scientific document, and that ancient civilizations--older
          and greater than assumed--were the product of knowledge brought to
          Earth by the Anunnaki, "Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came." <br />
          <br /><i>The 12th Planet</i>, the first book of the series, presents
          ancient evidence for the existence of an additional planet in the
          Solar System: the home planet of the Anunnaki. In confirmation of this
          evidence, recent data from unmanned spacecraft has led astronomers to
          actively search for what is being called "Planet X." <br />
          <br />The subsequent volume, <i>The Stairway to Heaven</i>, traces
          man's unending search for immortality to a spaceport in the Sinai
          Peninsula and to the Giza pyramids, which had served as landing
          beacons for it--refuting the notion that these pyramids were built by
          human pharaohs. Recently, records by an eye-witness to a forgery of an
          inscription by the pharaoh Khufu inside the Great Pyramid corroborated
          the book's conclusions. <br />
          <br />In<i> The Wars of Gods and Men</i>, the third volume of his
          series, Zacharia Sitchin recounts events closer to our times,
          concluding that the Sinai spaceport was destroyed 4,000 years ago with
          nuclear weapons. Photographs of Earth from space clearly show evidence
          of such an explosion.<i>The Wars of Gods and Men</i> additionally
          embraces Canaanite, Hittite, and Hindu sources to include in these
          investigations the incidents of The Great Flood, the Tower of Babel,
          and the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah. Sitchin's unique reexamination
          of ancient mysteries explains these past cataclysmic events in the
          history of humanity, opening insights into our future.

        <p>
          Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) was born in Russia and raised in
          Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of modern and
          ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old
          Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. He was
          distinguished by his ability to translate and interpret ancient
          Sumerian and other ancient texts. A graduate of the University of
          London, he worked as a journalist and editor in Israel for many years
          before making his home in New York City.
