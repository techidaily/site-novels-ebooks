          When we lie awake at night listening to mysterious sounds, we imagine
          all the things that could be making those strange noises. The rumbling
          is the sound of the refrigerator; the knocking is from the old
          furnace; the creaking is nothing more than the house settling...isn’t
          it? Although the modern world has denied the existence of things that
          go bump in the night and has taught us that the occult couldn’t
          possibly exist, we know there are things that science has yet to
          explain.<br /><br /><i>Defense Against the Dark</i> introduces the
          reader to many of those unsavory magickal creatures and occult
          happenings that exist outside of fairytales. Our ancestors knew these
          threats were real, and took precautions to protect themselves from
          whatever evil was lurking in the shadows.<br /><br /><i
            >Defense Against the Dark</i
          >
          will teach you:<br />Common lore and mythology of predatory entities
          such as goblins, vampires, imps, and ghosts<br />How to identify
          malevolent spirits and understand how curses actually work<br />How to
          master different protection methods, including shielding, banishing,
          and hex breaking<br />Easy, concrete methods for protecting yourself
          in everyday situations

          "Whether you are experienced in magick or are just interested in the
          practices and foundation of it, this book will lead you through many
          different subjects ranging from cleansing oneself to the ridding of
          negative influences and supernatural beings. Wonderfully written and
          well organized, Ms. Carlin takes a step further by delving into the
          backgrounds and folklore of many different subjects. A creative piece
          regardless of ones' belief systems, this book allows one to rethink
          beyond one's normal cognition." --<b>Allison Knoedler</b>,
