            We're all searching for something to last. We live our lives ever
            reaching for the next bar, meeting that right person, getting the
            perfect job, doing what we can do to make our lives what we think it
            should be. If you're a believer in Christ, then you pray and you ask
            favors, requests whatever you want to call them but they are a way
            of reaching out to the greater power that we do not possess. You may
            have been the victim of child abuse, a personal crime, a vendetta,
            or the perpetrator. You have been asking and praying for an answer
            or miracle to your need and relief from the burden you carry. What
            we forget is in order to receive from God, we must receive what he
            gives. Sometimes it isn't what we asked or prayed for, but it's an
            answer. This book is titled When Your Mind Steals Your Soul's
            Reward. It is meant as a message, that in order to receive, you must
            first think it possible. With the power of life and death being in
            the tongue, speak it!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            You must speak into your life what you hope and pray for. Faith is
            believing in the things that are hoped for and the evidence of
            things not seen. This is putting your faith into action. You must
            first think it, speak it, expect it just as Jesus said believe when
            you pray though your father has already given you what you asked
            for.
          </p>

            The messages and very deep and personal accounts during Carol's life
            shared in this book are meant to enlighten, encourage, and
            strengthen your ability to receive God's amazing gifts and miracles
            through the power of words. God's abilities are not limited by our
            faith however. We do limit ourselves by our own spoken words of
            failure, fear, and felt circumstances. So often we are defeated
            before ever given the opportunity to see God's plan revealed by the
            words we speak, therefore directing the path of decisions made. This
            book is to be read with an open heart and praying throughout that
            God give you discernment and wisdom as you read as well as the
            ability to keep going, it will be painful at times.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I believe with all my heart you will see miracles you have prayed
            for and know it is God and God only who is able to release them to
            you. It will be because you are finally able to receive through the
            knowledge of the power of your spoken words. So, go now in the power
            of his might and seek him so that you may have ears to hear and eyes
            to see as he leads you in this endeavor.
          </p>

            In any offences at the truths shared in this book apologies first.
            Led as I am, it is all 100 percent the undeniable truth as seen
            through my eyes in this journey we call life.
