            >One of the most ambitious works of paranormal investigation of our
            time, here is an unprecedented compendium of pre-twentieth-century
            UFO accounts, written with rigor and color by two of today's leading
            investigators of unexplained phenomena.
          </b>
          <br /><br />
          In the past century, individuals, newspapers, and military agencies
          have recorded thousands of UFO incidents, giving rise to much
          speculation about flying saucers, visitors from other planets, and
          alien abductions. Yet the extraterrestrial phenomenon did not begin in
          the present era. Far from it. The authors of
          <i>Wonders in the Sky</i> reveal a thread of vividly rendered-and
          sometimes strikingly similar- reports of mysterious aerial phenomena
          from antiquity through the modern age. These accounts often share
          definite physical features- such as the heat felt and described by
          witnesses-that have not changed much over the centuries. Indeed, such
          similarities between ancient and modern sightings are the rule rather
          than the exception. <br /><br />
          In <i>Wonders in the Sky</i>, respected researchers Jacques Vallee and
          Chris Aubeck examine more than 500 selected reports of sightings from
          biblical-age antiquity through the year 1879-the point at which the
          Industrial Revolution deeply changed the nature of human society, and
          the skies began to open to airplanes, dirigibles, rockets, and other
          opportunities for misinterpretation represented by military
          prototypes. Using vivid and engaging case studies, and more than
          seventy-five illustrations, they reveal that unidentified flying
          objects have had a major impact not only on popular culture but on our
          history, on our religion, and on the models of the world humanity has
          formed from deepest antiquity. <br /><br />
          Sure to become a classic among UFO enthusiasts and other followers of
          unexplained phenomena, <i>Wonders in the Sky</i> is the most
          ambitious, broad-reaching, and intelligent analysis ever written on
          premodern aerial mysteries.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Jacques Vallee</b>&nbsp;holds a master’s degree in astrophysics
          from France and a PhD in computer science from Northwestern
          University. He is the author of several books about high technology
          and unidentified phenomena, a subject that first attracted his
          attention as an astronomer in Paris. While analyzing observations from
          many parts of the world, Vallee became intrigued by the similarities
          in every culture in patterns between modern sightings and historical
          reports of encounters with flying objects and their occupants. After a
          career as an information scientist with Stanford Research Institute
          and the Institute for the Future, where he served as a principal
          investigator for the groupware project on the ARPANET, the prototype
          of the Internet, Vallee cofounded a venture capital firm in Silicon
          Valley. He lives in San Francisco.<br /><br /><b>Chris Aubeck</b> was
          born in London. He moved to Spain at age 19, and after teaching in
          Cáceres and Madrid for 24 years, he now lives in Granada. His interest
          in the historical and sociological aspects of unexplained aerial
          phenomena began at an early age. A student of language and folklore,
          he has helped compile the largest collection of pre-1947 UFO cases in
          the world. He has spoken on his research in many articles and on
          public radio. In 2008 he was awarded a prize for his contributions to
          the field by the Spanish organization Fundación Anomalía.
