            >Spiritual coach and intuitive tarot reader Liz Roberta helps

            >That deeper calling within you? Don't ignore it! It's time to start
            listening to your intuition - and following it to find your true
            purpose.</b
          ><br /><br />Intuition is the strongest tool we have, but far too
          often we forget to use it or aren't sure where to begin. If you're
          feeling a little lost, unmotivated or unsure of the best path to take,
          it's time to look inward and listen. This is the ultimate guide for
          you to connect with your intuition, discover your soul's calling and
          finally lead a life where you feel inspired, joyful and in flow.<br /><br />Liz
          Roberta has devised an accessible framework of 21 transformative
          questions to help you take practical steps to activate your intuition,
          figure out what feels right for you and start living in alignment with
          your purpose. These questions will help you to see the most potent and
          powerful parts of yourself that you may have been hiding from. You'll
          discover how to:<br /><br />· tune in to your own intuition<br />·
          identify your life purpose<br />· trust yourself deeply and gain
          confidence<br />· choose a life path that is truly your own<br /><br />You
          are here for a reason and your soul knows what's best for you. When
          you finish the last page, you'll know too. Trust your intuition, start
          living in tune with the flow of life and you'll find you're able to
          guide yourself to exactly where you're meant to be.

          In this brilliant book, Liz shows you how to ask the right questions
          so you can activate your intuition and find your purpose. A must-read
          for any spiritual explorer! - Spirit &amp; Destiny magazine<br /><br />Liz
          Roberta is a millennial manifestor who gives spiritual people what
          they need to succeed. - Kindred Spirit magazine<br /><br />Roberta had
          a realisation that, through her work, she was called to stand between
          two worlds and bring them together – the spiritual world and the
          mainstream world. She wanted to blend the best of both so that each
          world would benefit; and this is what her work, I believe,
          successfully offers. Reading <i>Living in Tune</i>, you can learn how
          to listen to your intuitive voice in a way that manifests itself to
          support the demands and practicalities of everyday life – a challenge
          we all face in the real world. - JUNO Magazine<br /><br />Liz is a
          powerful presence; she emanates spontaneity and lives an inspiring
          message. - Jonny Wilkinson, CBE, England Rugby Player
