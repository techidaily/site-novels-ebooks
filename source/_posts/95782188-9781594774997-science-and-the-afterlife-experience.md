          Reveals the evidence of life beyond death <br />
          <br />• Examines 125 years of scientific research into reincarnation,
          apparitions, and communication with the dead showing these phenomena
          are real <br />
          <br />• Reveals the existence of higher planes of consciousness where
          the souls of the dead can choose to advance or manifest once again on
          Earth <br />
          <br />• Explains how these findings have been ignored and denied
          because they are incompatible with materialist doctrines <br />
          <br />In this book, Chris Carter shows that evidence of life beyond
          death exists and has been around for millennia, predating any
          organized religion. Focusing on three key phenomena--reincarnation,
          apparitions, and communications from the dead--Carter reveals 125
          years of documented scientific studies by independent researchers and
          the British and American Societies for Psychical Research that rule
          out hoaxes, fraud, and hallucinations and prove these afterlife
          phenomena are real. <br />
          <br />The author examines historic and modern accounts of detailed
          past-life memories, visits from the deceased, and communications with
          the dead via medium and automatic writing as well as the scientific
          methods used to confirm these experiences. He explains how these
          findings on the afterlife have been ignored and denied because they
          are incompatible with the prevailing doctrine of materialism. Sharing
          messages from the dead themselves describing the afterlife, Carter
          reveals how consciousness exists outside the parameters of biological
          evolution and emerges through the medium of the brain to use the
          physical world as a springboard for growth. After death, souls can
          advance to higher planes of consciousness or manifest once again on
          Earth. Carter’s rigorous argument proves--beyond <i>any</i> reasonable
          doubt--not only that consciousness survives death and continues in the
          afterlife, but that it precedes birth as well.

        <p>
          “The evidence in favour of an afterlife is vast and varied. The
          evidence from near-death experiences and deathbed visions was
          described in two previous books by Chris Carter. Science and the
          Afterlife is the final work of his trilogy, and one will see in this
          wonderful book that we do indeed have strongly repeatable evidence for
          the continuity of consciousness after physical death, based on
          children who remember previous lives, reports of apparitions, and
          communication from the deceased. What all these cases show is that
          human personality survives death and, by implication, human
          consciousness can exist independently of a functioning brain. When one
          has read the overwhelming evidence as described in this excellent book
          it seems quite impossible not to be convinced that there should be
          some form of life after death. Any continuing opposition to the
          evidence is based on nothing more than willful ignorance or ideology.
          Highly recommended.”
