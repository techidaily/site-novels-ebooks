            Where does true wellness start? For thousands of years, traditional
            healers have been able to detect and correct imbalances at the
            energetic level in order to heal our physical ailments. Today, these
            traditions are expanding the medical understanding of our subtle
            anatomy and its role in our overall well-being. With
            <i>Energy Healing</i>, integrative physician Ann Marie Chiasson
            offers a complete guidebook of easy-to-use energy practices to
            enhance your health and vitality. Drawing from the material she
            teaches at Dr. Andrew Weil's Arizona Center for Integrative
            Medicine, Dr. Chiasson explores:<br />Our subtle
            anatomy—understanding the chakras, meridians, and the key principles
            of energy healingSelf-diagnosis techniques for detecting the
            movement of energy in our bodies—even if you've never sensed energy
            beforePractices for daily self-care and specific techniques to
            address energy blocks often seen in common illnesses and health
            issuesWhy our energy wanes as we age, and how we can replenish our
            vitality from sources in the world around usYour body as your
            teacher—insights for adapting and developing your own energy healing
            techniques<br />In creating this book Dr. Chiasson has selected the
            methods she has found to be most accessible, effective, and
            beneficial in the long-term—informed by the latest research, healing
            traditions from around the world, and her own practice. With
            <i>Energy Healing</i>, she presents an indispensible guide for
            understanding the energetic dimension of your well-being and
            essential tools to help you take charge of your own health.<br />&nbsp;<br />“This
            book is an excellent guide for anyone interested in exploring energy
            as a means of maintaining healthy, dynamic living.”<br />—from the
            foreword by Andrew Weil, MD<br />“Dr. Ann Marie Chiasson does the
            impossible: she demystifies energy medicine without eradicating the
            mystery. Using her own personal stories as well as those of the
            patients she has cared for, she makes visible the unifying
            principles shared by systems as diverse as the chakras, qi, and the
            matrix. In so doing, she puts centuries of wisdom at our fingertips.
            If you want to learn energy medicine, this is the book to read.”<br />—Victoria
            Maizes, MD, executive director, Arizona Center for Integrative
            Medicine and professor of clinical medicine, family medicine, and
            public health at the University of Arizona<br />“Dr. Ann Marie
            Chiasson shares a powerful and practical manual on how to harness
            the innate life force that surrounds and interpenetrates our very
            lives. It allows everyone access to energetic techniques once kept
            secret in many healing traditions.”<br />—Master Stephen Co, founder
            of Pranic Healing and author of <i>The Power of Prana</i>
