              >A psychologist's journey to understand one of the most unusual
              experiences known to humankind: the universal, disturbing feeling
              that someone or something is there when we are alone.</b
            ><br /><br />These experiences of sensing a <i>Presence</i> when no
            one else is there have been given many names—the Third Man, guardian
            angels, shadow figures, “social” hallucinations—and they have
            inspired, unsettled, and confounded in equal measure.<br /><br />While
            the contexts in which they occur are diverse, they are united by a
            distinct and uncanny feeling of visitation by another. But what does
            this feeling mean, and where does it come from? When and why do
            presences emerge? And how can we even begin to understand a
            phenomenon that can be transformative for those who experience it,
            and yet so hard to put into words?<br /><br />The answers to these
            questions lie in this tour-de-force through contemporary psychology,
            psychiatry, neuroscience, and philosophy. <i>Presence</i> follows
            Ben Alderson-Day's attempts—as a psychologist and a researcher—to
            understand how this experience is possible. What is a voice when it
            isn’t heard, and how otherwise do we know or feel that someone is in
            our presence? Is it a hallucination connected to psychosis, a change
            in the working of the brain, or something else? <br /><br />The
            journey to understand takes us to meet explorers, mediums, and
            robots, and step through real, imagined, and virtual worlds.
            <i>Presence</i> is the story of who we carry with us, at all times,
            as parts of ourselves.

          "Drawing on first-person accounts, interviews, and research in various
          fields such as psychiatry, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology,
          the author presents a robust investigation into the phenomenon." -
          <i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)<br /><br />"Alderson-Day
          offers a thrilling and erudite survey of the experience of "felt
          presence" - where one has the strong feeling that someone, or
          something, is there, but without any input from our traditional
          senses. The book brings together rich testimonies of this core human
          experience, with the insights of myth, history, philosophy,
          psychology, neuroscience, and psychiatry. Reading it leaves one with
          an enriched appreciation of what we are and how much more we have yet
          to understand about ourselves.'" - Matthew Broome, Professor of
          Psychiatry and Youth Mental Health and Director of the Institute for
          Mental Health, University of Birmingham<br /><br />"The sense that you
          are not alone - that someone or something is "there" - is a
          fascinating topic and this marvellous book draws across many different
          kinds of experiences to give a coherent account of the kinds of
          processes that underlie this feeling." - Sophie Scott, Director of the
          Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London
