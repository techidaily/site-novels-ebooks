          <b>After 'Hit Man'<br /><br /></b>The New York Times bestseller
          <i>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</i> documents John Perkins’
          extraordinary career as a globe-trotting economic hit man. Perkins’
          insider’s view leads him to crisis of conscience--to the realization
          that he must devote himself to work which will foster a world-wide
          awareness of the sanctity of indigenous peoples, their cultures, and
          their environments. Perkins’ books demonstrate how the age-old
          shamanic techniques of some of the world’s most primitive peoples have
          sparked a revolution in modern concepts about healing, the
          subconscious, and the powers each of us has to alter individual and
          communal reality.<br /><br />This groundbreaking book is John
          Perkins’s firsthand account of his experiences with the shamanic
          technique of psychonavigation--a method of traveling outside the body
          by means of visions and dream wanderings--and his encounters with the
          Shuar of the Amazon, the Quechua of the Andes, and the Bugis of
          Indonesia. Shuar shamans psychonavigate for the purposes of hunting
          and healing, while the Bugis, among the most renowned sailors of the
          world, use these techniques to navigate without the aid of charts and
          compasses. Perkins explains how these techniques work and how the
          people of these indigenous cultures psychonavigate to both distant
          physical destinations and sources of inner wisdom.
          <br /><br />Throughout history, psychonavigation has been practiced by
          highly creative minds such as Beethoven, Jung, and Einstein. Perkins’s
          riveting narrative takes us on a journey of personal discovery as he
          learns the great value of these techniques and their relevance not
          only to individual well-being, but to the health of the environment
          and of the world at large. He reveals how by attuning to the positive
          forces in nature and communicating with our inner guides we all can
          become psychonavigators, finding our way to wise decisions and
          developing innovative approaches to the challenges we face as
          individuals and a world community.
