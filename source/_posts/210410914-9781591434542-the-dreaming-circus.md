          • Explains how the author became a student of Toltec spiritual teacher
          don Miguel Ruiz and how he traveled the world, as well as the astral
          realms, undergoing a deep spiritual journey of change <br /><br />•
          Details how the author discovered LSD after the Vietnam War and even
          tripped while skydiving <br /><br />• Recounts his time as a civil
          rights advocate and war correspondent, and how Toltec shamanism helped
          prepare him to ease his wife’s long end-of-life journey
          <br /><br />During his third tour of duty in Vietnam where he served
          as a Green Beret, Jim Morris was wounded badly enough to be retired
          from the army. He came home bitter, angry that his career had been
          ended. After reading <i>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</i>, he
          realized that many members of Ken Kesey’s Merry Pranksters had also
          been combat officers. Following this spiritual “hint,” he spent the
          next couple of years as an acid head, even skydiving on LSD. Awakened
          by his LSD experiences, Morris immersed himself in the books of Carlos
          Castaneda as well as in Kriya yoga, Charismatic Christianity, and
          <i>A Course in Miracles</i>. From these experiences he was led to
          Toltec spiritual teacher don Miguel Ruiz and began a deep spiritual
          journey of change.<br /><br />Sharing his journey from PTSD to
          spiritual awakening, Morris recounts his time as a civil rights
          advocate for the Montagnard people in Vietnam and his years as a war
          correspondent at the same time he was following Castaneda’s Warrior’s
          Way. He describes his momentous meeting with don Miguel Ruiz as well
          as his travels around the world and in the astral realms. Sharing how
          his wife developed dementia and later became paralyzed, Morris
          explains how it required all his Toltec training, all his military
          training, everything he had to share her final years in a meaningful
          and fulfilling way. <br /><br />Written from a deep understanding of
          Toltec techniques this book shows in a heartfelt and resonant way what
          a spiritual path can give you.
