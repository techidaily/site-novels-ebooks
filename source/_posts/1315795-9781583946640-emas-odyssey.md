          Follow the fantastic odyssey of one woman as she explores shamanic
          realms, encountering spirit animals and other teachers who answer her
          deepest questions and provide her with life-changing guidance and
          healing. Widowed, childless, and alone, 60-year-old Ema bravely
          decides to expand her self-knowledge by embarking on a spiritual
          adventure. She meets with author Sandra Harner, who leads her through
          five sessions of Harner Shamanic Counseling (HSC), a highly effective
          system of personal problem-solving in which counselors help clients
          enter a shamanic state of consciousness using a specific sonic rhythm.
          While in this state, clients seek out helping spirits, who offer
          insight, wisdom, and healing.<br /><br />
          By the end of her sessions with Harner, Ema has discovered her own
          innate ability to find answers to pervasive personal questions,
          overcome inhibitory fears, and acquire self-confidence and wisdom. She
          has found a sense of personal empowerment and a newfound joy in
          existence--and decides she wants to continue her journeys
          independently. From 1999 to 2011, Ema ventures on a total of 64
          journeys, each one chronicled in this book, thanks to taped recordings
          of her simultaneous narration.<br /><br />
          In addition to serving as an invaluable resource for students and
          practitioners of shamanism, psychology, and alternative modalities of
          therapy, <i>Ema's Odyssey</i> enchants us with its lyrical poetry and
          unique wisdom, and inspires us with its demonstration of courage,
          curiosity, persistence, and humility. Perhaps most importantly, we
          come away with the added assurance that we are not alone, that there
          are oft-untapped resources we all can access, given the tools and
          trust in our own experience.

          “<i>Ema’s Odyssey</i> is an invaluable source of information about
          non-ordinary realities that should not be missing in the library of
          any spiritual seeker.”<br />
          —Stanislav Grof, MD, author of
          <i>Psychology of the Future, When the Impossible Happens, </i>and<i>
            Healing Our Deepest Wounds</i
          ><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “A beautiful and remarkable account. It reminds us that wisdom and
          mystery are so close, and like shamans of old, we can journey there
          too.”<br />—Jack Kornfield, PhD, author of <i>A Path with Heart</i
          ><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “This fascinating account of contemporary shamanic practice in the
          service of healing is a wise and illuminating introduction to this
          ancient tradition. Dr. Harner’s book is a unique and important
          contribution to our understanding of shamanism and spiritual
          freedom.”<br />—Frances Vaughan, PhD, psychologist and author of
          <i>Shadows of the Sacred</i><br /><br />“No where else will you find a
          more compelling and illuminating account of the inherent wisdom,
          spiritual democracy, and transformative power found within the
          experience of shamanic journeying—the most ancient of spiritual
          practices! Not only a must read for students and practitioners of
          shamanism, but for anyone, personally or professionally, who is
          interested in spiritual liberation, personal growth, self-discovery,
          and self-healing.”<br />—Angeles Arrien, cultural anthropologist and
          president of the Foundation for Cross-Cultural Education &amp;
          Research<br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “<i>Ema’s Odyssey </i>captivates and delivers us into the sparkling
          mystery of our very existence.”<br />—Barbara Berger, LAc,
          acupuncturist and specialist in the healing benefits of microcurrent
          therapy<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “A powerful and inspiring collaboration filled with wisdom and sure to
          touch the heart.”<br />—Randy Cherner, founder of the Cherner
          Institute, a center for the practice of somatic education<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This book is an important map of the far reaches of inner
          territories, as well as an expression of the intricate and rich poetry
          of the soul.”<br />—Christina Grof, PhD, author of
          <i>The Thirst for Wholeness, The Eggshell Landing, </i>and coauthor of
          <i>Spiritual Emergency </i>and <i>Holotropic Breathwork</i><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          <i>“Ema’s Odyssey </i>beautifully demonstrates the visionary, healing,
          and transformative power of the images and experiences that can emerge
          during shamanic journeys and shows, for the first time, how these
          experiences can evolve and can resolve multiple issues over multiple
          journeys.”<br />—Roger Walsh, MD, PhD, University of California,
          Irvine, author of <i>The World of Shamanism</i>
