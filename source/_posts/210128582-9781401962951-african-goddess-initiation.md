            >A sacred feminine initiation of self-love and soul care rituals,
            tools, and exercises.</b
          ><br /><b><br /></b>Spiritual teacher, intuitive coach, and
          award-winning author, Abiola Abrams invites you to activate African
          goddess magic to transmute your fears and limiting beliefs, so that
          you can create more happiness, abundance, and self-acceptance.<br /><br />Africa
          is a continent of 54+ countries, and her children are global. There is
          no one African spiritual tradition. Our ancestors who were trafficked
          in "The New World" hid the secrets of our orishas, abosom, lwas,
          álúsí, and god/desses behind saints, angels, and legendary characters.
          From South Africa to Egypt, Brazil to Haiti, Guyana to Louisiana,
          goddess wisdom still empowers us.<br /><br />Writes Abiola, "Spirit
          told me, "We choose who shows up." And if you are holding this book,
          then this sacred medicine is meant for you. In this book, you will
          meet ancient goddesses and divine feminine energy ancestors, legendary
          queens, and mystical spirits. As you complete their powerful rituals,
          and ascend through their temples, you will:<br /><br />. Awaken
          generational healing in the Temple of Ancestors;<br />. Manifest your
          miracles in the Temple of Conjurers;<br />. Release the struggle in
          the Temple of Warriors;<br />. Embrace your dark goddess self in the
          Temple of Shadows;<br />. Heal your primal wounds in the Temple of
          Lovers;<br />. Liberate your voice in the Temple of Griots;<br />.
          Open your third eye intuition in the Temple of Queens; and<br />.
          Surrender, meditate, and rise in the Temple of High Priestesses.<br /><br />Welcome
          to your goddess circle!

          There is no greater hand to hold through your guided journey into the
          land of self-love and spiritual connection than Abiola's, who will no
          doubt handle it with care. She has consistently shown up for women for
          more than a decade and brought out their very best, and this guided
          journey into our most sacred rituals is no exception.<br />
          - Charli Penn, editorial lifestyle director,
          <i>ESSENCE</i> magazine<br /><br />Abiola Abrams, a true African
          Goddess, has put her heart and soul into this inspiring book that
          helps guide you to self-awareness, self-healing, and self-love. This
          book is a must for every woman's household!<br />
          - Yvette Hayward, founder, African American Literary Awards&nbsp;<br /><br />We
          are at a crossroads spiritually and in search of answers. In African
          Goddess Initiation, Abiola introduces our ancient mothers back to us.
          It is a welcome reunion for those of us seeking a deeper connection
          with African spirituality and the ancient wisdom of our ancestors.<br />
          - Yolanda Sangweni, founder, African Women Create and senior director
          of programming, NPR<br /><br />Abiola Abrams is a powerful storyteller
          and historian. For anyone looking to explore Global African spiritual
          traditions laced with love, this is the text. Many of us have been
          forced to forget where we come from. African Goddess Initiation isn't
          just history; it contains rituals and ceremonies that tap into our
          collective DNA. Abiola's words are a soothing balm in turbulent times.
          This book is an offering, a gift from our ancestors, and they are felt
          on every page. A deep bow for Abrams as a channel, guide, and
          compassionate cheerleader. If African Goddess Initiation is in your
          hands, there is a reason. This book will permanently live on my
          nightstand when I need reminders, encouragement, or guidance. She's
          invited us all on this journey, solo or as a group. I'm eternally
          grateful for this wisdom and the invitation to reconnect with 'global
          sisterhood.'<br />
          - Oneika Mays, healer and star of TBS' Lost Resort&nbsp;<br /><br />Abiola
          invites us all to embrace the divine feminine energy within that is
          needed to nurture the planet at this time, and she takes us on a
          healing journey passed down from our ancestors to go within and
          activate our most authentic selves while removing limiting beliefs
          that hold us back from expressing who we truly are.<br />
          - Koya Webb, author of Let Your Fears Make You Fierce and star of Z
          Living series, Yoga Girls&nbsp;<br /><br />One of the most important
          contemporary books on the transformational power of ritual, and the
          journey to awakening the Divine Feminine in ourselves, Abiola Abrams
          has generously gifted us with a profound body of work inviting us into
          the sacred spaces and rituals of her spiritual ancestry-the
          extraordinary rich world of African goddess magic and mysticism. This
          book is pure alchemical magic. If you're called to open its pages, it
          offers nothing less than a fierce, loving, and timely initiation to
          awaken the Goddess within. More importantly it fills a great gap in
          our collective soul as the author reclaims the mystical power of her
          ancestors and firmly restores it to its rightful place. African
          Goddess Initiation is a living map to an inclusive unified world where
          we all are valued.<br />
