              ><br />It's time to bring therapy out of the therapy room and into
              the real world.</b
            ><br /><br />In recent years, therapy and self-care have become
            familiar buzzwords, but it's clear that people are having to face
            their emotional difficulties without the tools and insight to work
            through them. Enter <i>Real Talk</i>: A book to enable readers to
            have genuine, authentic conversations with themselves, and to start
            the journey of healing their past experiences and cope with the
            challenges of modern life.<br /><br />Filled with techniques and
            wisdom from a therapist's toolkit this is a must-have handbook for
            optimising your mental health. Drawing on her experience as a
            qualified psychotherapist and applying her intersectional
            perspective Tasha Bailey shares the knowledge and skills you need to
            change your life.<br /><br />Tasha's straight-talking but
            compassionate style will help readers hold up a mirror to their
            present situation and make sense of their past - delving into topics
            such as:<br /><br />路 <b>Trauma &amp; inner-child healing</b
            ><br /><br />路 <b>Love, trust, and attachment</b><br /><br />路
            <b>Family: </b
            ><b>intergenerational cycles of behaviour, rupture, and repair.</b
            ><br /><br />路 <b>Self-Esteem, b</b><b>odies &amp; sex</b
            ><br /><br /><i>Real Talk</i> contains a collection of lessons which
            the reader might typically learn in therapy. Tasha teaches readers
            modern language and ideas about mental health, exploring self-love
            and self-understanding. Connecting psychological theory, lived
            experience, references from modern day media and case studies from
            Tasha's work to create a more current, creative, and inclusive
            perspective of mental health.

          Tasha Bailey is an accredited psychotherapist - specialising in
          trauma, self-love and creativity in therapy - and has established
          herself as one of the go-to experts on social media talking about
          mental health; encouraging more open discussions about healing and
          self-care, making these conversations more fresh, inclusive and
          relevant. Tasha has contributed to and been featured by
          <i
            >Vogue, Stylist, Red Magazine, Buzzfeed, Refinery29, The
            Independent, Metro, Cosmopolitan,</i
          >
          <i>BBC Radi</i>o and more. <br /><br />Tasha uses her Instagram
          @RealTalk.Therapist to share her insights with those who can't access
          therapy, helping people to reflect, recognise and take stock of their
          emotions. Tasha has a trademark playful, relatable, light touch (which
          she showcases online) but does not shy away from addressing tough
          questions about how and why we see ourselves the way we do and what we
          can do to fulfil our potential. In September 2022 Tasha was named
          Health &amp; Wellness Influencer of the Year at the bCreator Awards.
