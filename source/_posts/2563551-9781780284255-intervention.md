          Alan Butler provides scientific evidence for time travel not only
          being real, but having already happened. Many key events in the
          history of humankind show evidence of having been intended by human
          beings from the future, who took specific actions that would steer the
          world in a particular direction. This 'intervention' theory is based
          on sound mathematical and scientific arguments, consistent with
          Einstein's demonstration of the possibility of time travel. Time
          travellers - some of them anonymous, some celebrated in history - have
          made alterations to our planetary and global environment (the creation
          of the Moon, the extinction of the dinosaurs) that were necessary to
          allow us to exist and to develop as an intelligent species. They have
          also left us markers that show what steps we need to take to progress
          further. All these interventions were placed retroactively within the
          'timeline' for future generations, not for those immediately affected.
          Key interventions include: The creation of the Moon If the Moon did
          not exist, nor would we. The author demonstrates that the Moon was
          built to make it possible for the Earth to become an incubator of
          life.<br /><br />The metal revolution The development of humanity's
          mastery over metal is a mystery, since the required temperatures for
          smelting metal exceeded anything that Neolithic man would have needed
          for any purpose. So how and why did smelting start? Add to that the
          fact that the first usable metal, bronze, is an alloy of copper and
          the much rarer tin and we begin to see the scale of the puzzle.
          Intervention supplies a convincing answer. The megalithic yard
          Neolithic peoples created a sophisticated, fully integrated system of
          measurements based on the actual size and mass of the Earth - a
          'marker' for future scientific developments, surfacing again,
          apparently out of the blue, in 18th-century Washington, DC. But the
          most spectacular revelation lies in our future. By looking at the
          mathematics underlying many of the inventions, we discover, with
          unexpected precision, when our first contact with our future selves
          will happen. This will occur within the lifetime of most readers of
          this extraordinary book.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Alan Butler has spent 30 years immersed in world history, writing
          books delving into neglected recesses of the past, including ancient
          cosmology. Three of his books written with co-author Christopher
          Knight have attained cult status: Civilization One (2004), Before the
          Pyramids (2009) and The Hiram Key Revisited (2010), all published by
          Watkins. His most recent title was City of the Goddess (also published
          by Watkins, 2011).
