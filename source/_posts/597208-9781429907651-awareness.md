              >One of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century
              will help you learn how to live in the present moment in
              <i>Awareness: The Key to Living in Balance</i>.</b
            ><br /><br />Underlying all meditation techniques, including martial
            arts—and in fact underlying all great athletic performances—is a
            quality of being awake and present to the moment, a quality that
            Osho calls awareness. Once we can identify and understand what this
            quality of awareness is, we have the key to self-mastery in
            virtually every area of our lives.<br /><br />According to great
            masters like Lao Tzu or Buddha, most of us move through our lives
            like sleepwalkers. Never really present in what we are doing, never
            fully alert to our environment, and not even aware of what motivates
            us to do and say the things we do.<br /><br />At the same time, all
            of us have experienced moments of awareness—or awakening, to use
            another—in extraordinary circumstances. On the road, in a sudden and
            unexpected accident, time seems to stop and one is suddenly aware of
            every movement, every sound, every thought. Or in moments that touch
            us deeply—welcoming a new baby into the world for the first time, or
            being with someone at the moment of death.<br /><br />Awareness,
            says Osho, is the key to being self-directed, centered, and free in
            every aspect of our lives. In this book, Osho teaches how to live
            life more attentively, mindfully, and meditatively, with love,
            caring and consciousness.<br /><br /><b
              >Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the
              conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their
              capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described
              by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the “1000 Makers of
              the 20th Century” and by <i>Sunday Mid-Day </i>(India) as one of
              the ten people—along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha—who have
              changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the
              influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers
              of all ages in virtually every country of the world.</b
