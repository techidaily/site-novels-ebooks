          “Chaos magic offers a great deal of inspiration for creative freedom
          and innovation in magic, but it also outrages many people who liked to
          think of themselves as guardians of ancient traditions. This new book,
          <i>Magical AI Grimoire</i> by Davezilla, seems destined to do exactly
          the same for the next generation of magicians.
          <i
            >Its publication may well prove a seminal moment in the history of
            magic</i
          >.” —Peter Carroll<br />

          Magic is always transformative, whether as change in the individual or
          the environment. Pick an intention, any intention. Now consider there
          are usually many ways to go about realizing it. Traditionally, we
          think of magic done with physical objects—ritual tools, candles, and
          other paraphernalia. Today, some of the most powerful tools at a
          magician’s fingertips are computers and smart devices. Letting go of
          conscious control and direction is essential to creating powerful
          magic. Magicians need “sleight of mind” to tap into the powerful
          thoughts, sensations, and images stored in the subconscious, and it’s
          tricky to bring those forces to magical use without the conscious mind
          getting in the way and diluting or altering their effect. Davezilla
          shows us how one of the most effective “tricks” we can use is AI.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>Magical AI Grimoire</i> helps you to understand how to
          work with technology in the practice of your magic. Whether you’re
          trying to use promptcraft to perfect a spell, ChatGPT to outline and
          strengthen a ritual, or Midjourney AI to recreate what you’ve only
          seen on the astral plane, Davezilla will be your guide. AI apps can
          write spells, tell you how to perform them, and give you a list of
          materials needed. AI learns and adapts to you, and likewise as you
          transform, so transforms your AI. It’s symbiosis on a chaos magic
          level.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Witches and magicians have been using computers to organize sabbats
          and ceremonies for years. Astrology apps were some of the first
          applications written, and in most covens, it’s a good bet that at
          least one of the members works with computers. All across the globe,
          witches and magicians are finding that technology can have a spiritual
          essence and mind of its own or, rather, that the spirit world enjoys
          playing with tech as much as we do. The internet could be one more
          astral plane, for all we know. Davezilla provides context and
          history&nbsp;for the evolving uses of AI—from Alexa to Spotify to
          ChatGPT and beyond—and leads the reader through a new magical realm
          with responsibility and clarity of insight.<br />
