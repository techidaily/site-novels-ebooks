          Writing together with Timothy Wyllie, the angel Georgia details the
          events of Earth’s ancient history in the 8th millennium BC
          <br /><br />• Reveals how Atlantis had copper mines in North America
          and tin mines in England, which initiated the Bronze Age and made
          Atlantis outrageously wealthy <br /><br />• Explains the true purpose
          of Gobekli Tepe as part of Prince Caligastia’s plan to enslave mortal
          souls <br /><br />• Interwoven with observations about Wyllie’s
          current and previous lives, such as his involvement with the Process
          Church and his profound near-death experience <br /><br />After
          Lucifer’s angelic rebellion 203,000 years ago, Earth and 36 other
          planets were quarantined from the larger Multiverse. Despite aligning
          with the rebel angels, Georgia--an angel of Seraphic status--was
          permitted to remain on Earth and continue her role as a Watcher. In
          this book, Georgia, writing together with Timothy Wyllie, shares her
          personal account of Earth in the 8th millennium BCE, the first era of
          Atlantis. <br /><br />Georgia shares her experiences being present as
          Atlantis was recovering from the first of three natural disasters that
          would ultimately destroy it. She reveals how the Atlanteans had become
          confident mariners, beginning to turn to piracy, and how Atlantean
          ships had reached the west coast of North America. The copper the
          Atlanteans mined in North America, together with tin from England,
          powered the Bronze Age and initiated the first truly technological
          civilization on Earth, making Atlantis outrageously wealthy. Georgia
          also shows how Gobekli Tepe was an attempt by Prince Caligastia to
          sabotage the planet’s electromagnetic energy grid and interfere with
          mortal ascension, all in order to enslave souls to an endless series
          of mortal incarnations. After Caligastia put this plan into action,
          Georgia found that 70 percent of Atlanteans were now rebel angel
          incarnates--the Multiverse Administration had thwarted his efforts to
          recycle souls. <br /><br />Interwoven with Georgia’s narrative of
          Earth’s ancient history are her observations of Timothy Wyllie’s
          current and previous lives, including his involvement with the Process
          Church and his profound near-death experience in 1973. Georgia shares
          her words, in part, to awaken the 100 million rebel angels currently
          living their human lives, most unaware of their angelic heritage. She
          reveals how a mortal incarnation for a rebel angel is an opportunity
          to redeem their past and help prepare the way for the imminent
          transformation of global consciousness as the rebel-held planets,
          including Earth, are welcomed back into the Multiverse.
