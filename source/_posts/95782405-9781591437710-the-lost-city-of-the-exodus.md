          Recent archaeological findings confirm Osman’s 25-year-old discovery
          of the location of the city of the Exodus <br />
          <br />• Explains why modern scholars have been unable to find the city
          of the Exodus: they are looking in the wrong historical period and
          thus the wrong region of Egypt <br />
          <br />• Details the author’s extensive research on Hebrew scriptures
          and ancient Egyptian texts and records, which allowed him to pinpoint
          the Exodus site <br />
          <br />• Reveals his effort to have his finding confirmed by the
          Egyptian government, including his debates with Zahi Hawass, Egyptian
          Minister for Antiquities Affairs <br />
          <br />When the first archaeologists visited Egypt in the late 1800s,
          they arrived in the eastern Nile Delta to verify the events described
          in the biblical Book of Exodus. Several locations believed to be the
          city of the Exodus were found but all were later rejected for lack of
          evidence. This led many scholars to dismiss the Exodus narrative
          merely as a myth that borrowed from accounts of the Hyksos expulsion
          from Egypt. But as Ahmed Osman shows, the events of Exodus have a
          historical basis and the ruins of the ancient city of Zarw, where the
          Road to Canaan began, have been found. <br />
          <br />Drawing on decades of research as well as recent archaeological
          findings in Egypt, Ahmed Osman reveals the exact location of the lost
          city of the Exodus as well as his 25-year effort to have this finding
          confirmed by the Egyptian government, including his heated debates
          with Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian Minister for Antiquities Affairs. He
          explains why modern scholars have been unable to find the city of the
          Exodus: they are looking in the wrong historical period and thus the
          wrong region of Egypt. He details his extensive research on the
          Pentateuch of the Hebrew scriptures, the historical scenes recorded in
          the great hall of Karnak, and other ancient source texts, which
          allowed him to pinpoint the Exodus site after he discovered that the
          Exodus happened not during the pharaonic reign of Ramses II but during
          that of his grandfather Ramses I. <br />
          <br />Osman concluded that the biblical city of the Exodus was to be
          found at Tell Heboua at the ruins of the fortified city of Zarw, the
          royal city of Ramses I--far from the Exodus locations theorized by
          previous archaeologists and scholars. In 2012, after 20 years of
          archaeological work, the location of Zarw was confirmed by Egyptian
          officials exactly where Osman said it would be 25 years ago. Thus,
          Osman shows that, time and again, if we take the creators of the
          source texts at their word, they will prove to be right.

          “Ahmed Osman has done it again! Combining meticulous research with a
          sharp mind, Osman’s <i>The Lost City of the Exodus</i> reads like an
          Agatha Christie whodunit and a Dan Brown thriller rolled into one!
          This literary gem of a book provides the long-awaited smoking-gun
          evidence and hard-to-refute arguments that show where, how, and when
          the biblical Exodus took place. A brilliant tour-de-force!”
