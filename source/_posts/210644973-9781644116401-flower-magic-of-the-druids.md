          <b>A practical guide to using flowers in magical practice</b
          ><br /><br />• Provides detailed instruction on every stage of the
          harvesting, crafting, and practical use of flower magic potions,
          including a comprehensive herbarium of all the flowers that may be
          used<br /><br />• Discusses what type of flower and form of flower
          magic is best for specific enchantments and rituals in the areas of
          love and sex magic, healing and focusing, and protection<br /><br />•
          Looks at the physical and spiritual gifts of bees and the importance
          of bee culture in Druidic flower magic<br /><br />Flowers are found in
          magic traditions around the world, from those in ancient Egypt, China,
          and India to the traditions of the Norse and Native Americans. Yet
          many of today’s well-established flower traditions—like bridal
          bouquets—originated in the Druidic magical lore of Wales, Ireland, and
          Scotland. <br /><br />As fifth-generation Druid Jon G. Hughes
          explains, flowers hold a preeminent position in Druidic folk magic
          with their own special branch of magical workings. In this practical
          guide, Hughes details how to use flowers in magical practice, focusing
          on flowering plants with a long history of magical use going back to
          Druidic times yet many of which are commonly found throughout the
          world, such as buttercup, blackberry, and dog rose. He discusses what
          type of flower and form of flower magic is best for specific
          enchantments and rituals in the areas of love and sex magic,
          well-being and good fortune, and protection. He looks at the magical
          use of fresh flowers and provides detailed instruction on every stage
          of the harvesting, crafting, and practical use of flower magic
          potions, including a comprehensive herbarium of all the flowers that
          may be used. <br /><br />Examining the complex relationship between
          flowers and bees, the author looks at the physical and spiritual gifts
          of bees, such as honey, propolis, and beeswax, and the importance of
          bee culture in Druidic flower magic, including the tradition of the
          honeymoon, the significance of the hexagon, and medieval beekeeper
          lore. Inviting you into the gentle yet powerful realm of Druidic
          flower magic, the author also details how to plan, plant, and take
          care of your own magical flower garden with all the botanicals you
          will need to pursue the path of flower magic.
