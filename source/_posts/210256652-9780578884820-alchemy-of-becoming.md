            Humanity is poised for its next evolutionary phase, and radical,
            revolutionary, and spiritual technology is required for its
            realization.&nbsp;Alchemy of Becoming, Pritam Atma's third book in
            the Mystical Motherhood series, offers this technology, and in doing
            so, extends to you an invitation to awaken and evolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            This metaphysical text is dedicated to women and to helping them
            heal their wounds - on a personal level which will lead to the
            collective - so that they can access self-love and connection to
            their hearts. As a leap in consciousness is made on the planet,
            individuals will go through a heart-opening experience and
            alchemists will lead the way for this evolutionary journey to
            occur.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            To most of us, the word 'alchemist' implies a person who, working
            with base metals, endeavors to transmute them into gold. That
            describes the alchemist in the physical domain, but Pritam Atma is
            addressing the alchemist who has accessed an ancient spiritual
            technology - a technology that still involves searching for gold,
            but this time, the gold is your consciousness, your frequency, your
            best life.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            And the base metals are your original wounds: your long-established
            patterns that hold you back from the realization of your highest
            mission. Pritam chose to focus on relationships in this book, and
            she takes you through her personal journey of finding love in her
            life and the alchemical process of healing generational patterns and
            childhood conditioning that enabled her to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Alchemy of Becoming will help you to embark upon your own journey of
            healing, which may or not be the same as Pritam's. This book will
            lead you to a deeper relationship with yourself so that you can
            create a new life narrative. You will inevitably gain a great amount
            of energy, personal power, and sovereignty as you embark on this
            path of ancient initiation and awakening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The technology for the spiritual-seeking alchemist involves seven
            operations in which the physical and spiritual exquisitely
            intertwine. Pritam shares the depths and heights of her changes in
            each stage, the determination and fearlessness in her hero's
            journey, letting you, her fellow alchemist, see what is required and
            letting you know, too, that the journey is gloriously do-able.

            journey with IVF. And I just wanted to say thank you so much I could
            cry I'm so happy I found you. I was missing the link of spirit and
            supported conception and started to get worried if I made the right
            choice. Now I can't wait and I'm already preparing myself meditating
