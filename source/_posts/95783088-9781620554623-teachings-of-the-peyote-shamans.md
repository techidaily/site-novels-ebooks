          A rare in-depth look at the inner workings of Huichol shamanism <br />
          <br />• Describes the five sacred sites of the Huichol and their
          peyote ceremonies <br />
          <br />• Explains how the Huichol teachings of awareness, centered on
          the five points of attention, connect you to your true essence <br />
          <br />• Reveals the deep relationship between Huichol cosmology,
          Gnosticism, and Christianity, especially Jesus Christ and the Virgin
          Mary <br />
          <br />Taking place in the heart of the Huichol homeland in western
          Mexico, this book offers a rare in-depth look at the inner workings of
          Huichol shamanism, which is permeated with the use of the sacred
          peyote cactus. Outsiders are almost never allowed access to Huichol
          sacred sites and ceremonies; however, James Endredy, after years of
          friendship with Huichol families, earned the privilege nearly by
          accident. Swayed by persistent pleading, he agreed to take another
          gringo into the mountains to one of the Huichols’ ceremonial centers,
          and they were both caught. After trial and punishment, Endredy was
          invited to stay within the sacred lands for the festivities he had
          illegally intruded upon and found his initiation into the Huichol
          shamanic tradition had begun. <br />
          <br />Sharing his intimate conversations and journeys with the shaman
          he calls “Peyote Jesus,” the author explains how Huichol belief
          revolves around the five sacred directions, the five sacred sites, and
          the five points of attention. As Peyote Jesus explains, the five
          points of attention refer to dividing your awareness yet staying
          focused on your inner self. This is not a normal state of
          consciousness for most people, yet when we maintain these points of
          attention, we discover our true essence and move closer to God. <br />
          <br />Endredy undergoes dozens of spiritual journeys with peyote as he
          makes the pilgrimages to the five sacred Huichol sites with Peyote
          Jesus. He is shocked by his vision of the Virgin Mary while under
          peyote’s guidance and learns of the deep relationship--strictly on
          Huichol terms--between their cosmology, Gnosticism, and Christianity,
          especially Jesus Christ. Providing an inside look at the major
          ceremonies and peyote rituals of the Huichol, this unexpectedly
          powerful book reveals the key tenants of the Huichol worldview, their
          beliefs in the afterlife, and their spiritual work on behalf of all of
          humanity.

        <p>
          “Beautifully written and engaging, Endredy’s tale recounts a
          ‘spiritual rescue mission’ to save the sacred peyote from those who
          seek to steal and/or exploit the Huichol’s most revered instrument for
          connecting with the cosmos. Unlike many books of the spiritual memoir
          genre, this story possesses a humanistic vividness and value that
          often gets lost in overly rarified accounts of journeys into
          non-Western realities.”
