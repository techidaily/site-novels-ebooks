          A journalist’s profound investigation into the reality behind an
          intense waking vision and the search for healing after death
          <br /><br />• Details the author’s vivid waking vision of a dying
          German soldier in World War II and how he discovered the soldier was a
          real person, including his research into German military archives and
          meeting the man’s surviving family members <br /><br />• Explores
          synchronicities, reincarnation, and communication across the veil
          between life and death <br /><br />• Reveals how the author helped the
          dead soldier find forgiveness and healing <br /><br />While on a
          spiritual retreat in Peru, journalist Stéphane Allix experienced a
          vivid waking vision of a soldier dying on a snowy battlefield,
          followed by scenes from the soldier’s earlier life. He also clearly
          saw the man’s name, Alexander Herrmann, and felt a disturbing sense of
          closeness with the soldier. <br /><br />Obsessed by the power of this
          extremely real vision, Allix began an intensive investigation that
          revealed this individual had actually existed: a German soldier who
          died in World War II during the 1941 Russian campaign. As he began
          retracing Herrmann’s past, he found that the other images accompanying
          the battle scene were also of people who had truly existed and were
          close to the man who died. Diving deep into German military archives,
          meeting the man’s surviving family members, and following his own
          intuitive hunches, the author also discovered that the soldier was
          part of the Waffen S.S., the infamous Totenkopf Brigade, and his
          investigation broadened to explore what drove Herrmann to become part
          of such an organization. <br /><br />While Allix’s initial impression
          is that this German soldier was a past life, as he progresses in his
          rigorous investigation and his decoding of the events surrounding it,
          he realizes that it was actually his own work with the paranormal and
          his unresolved feelings over the death of his brother and his father
          that made him particularly sensitive to the veil between life and
          death, culminating in the soul of this dead soldier coming to him in
          search of forgiveness and healing. Allix realizes that his mission is
          not to bring about the rebirth of this person but to heal him--and the
          victims of his ignominious actions during the war.
          <br /><br />Offering a fascinating exploration of visions,
          synchronicities, reincarnation, and the connections between the
          spiritual and physical planes, <i>When I Was Someone Else</i> shares a
          powerful message of healing after death along with the profound
          epiphany that light needs darkness to be perceived.
