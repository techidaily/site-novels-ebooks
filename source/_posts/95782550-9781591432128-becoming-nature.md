          A step-by-step guide to animal communication, connecting with your
          primal mind, and immersing yourself in Nature<br /><br />• Includes
          exercises for learning how to become invisible within Nature, sense
          hidden animals, and communicate with wild animals and birds<br /><br />•
          Explains how to approach wild animals and form friendships with
          them<br /><br />• Details the intuitive awareness of our
          hunter-gatherer ancestors and their innate oneness with Nature<br /><br />Animals
          and plants are in constant communication with the world around them.
          To join the conversation, we need only to connect with our primal mind
          and recognize that we, too, are Nature. Once in this state, we can
          communicate with animals as effortlessly as talking with friends. The
          songs of birds and the calls of animals start to make sense. We begin
          to see the reasons for their actions and discover that we can feel
          what they feel. We can sense the hidden animals around us, then get
          close enough to look into their eyes and touch them. Immersed in
          Nature, we are no longer intruders, but fellow beings moving in
          symphony with the Dance of Life.<br /><br />In this guide to becoming
          one with Nature, Tamarack Song provides step-by-step instructions for
          reawakening the innate sensory and intuitive abilities that our
          hunter-gatherer ancestors relied upon­--abilities imprinted in our DNA
          yet long forgotten. Through exercises and experiential stories, the
          author guides us to immerse ourselves in Nature at the deepest levels
          of perception, which allows us to sense the surrounding world and the
          living beings in it as extensions of our own awareness. He details how
          to open our minds and hearts to listen and communicate in the wordless
          language of wild animals and plants. He explains how to hone our
          imagining skill so we can transform into the animal we are seeking,
          along with becoming invisible by entering the silence of Nature. He
          shows how to approach a wild animal on her own terms, which erases her
          fear and shyness.<br /><br />Allowing us to feel the blind yearning of
          a vixen Fox in heat and the terror of a Squirrel fleeing a Pine
          Marten, the practices in this book strip away everything that
          separates us from the animals. They enable us to restore our kinship
          with the natural world, strengthen our spiritual relationships with
          the animals who share our planet, and discover the true essence of the
          wild within us.

          “I love the way Tamarack explains that you must get away from thought
          to understand animals. He is referring to verbal thought with language
          and entering the animal’s sensory-based world that has no words. To
          understand animals, you have to get away from words and enter their
          realm of visual, auditory, and touch sensation, which are linked to
          emotions. <i>Becoming Nature</i> will help connect you to the natural
          world.”
