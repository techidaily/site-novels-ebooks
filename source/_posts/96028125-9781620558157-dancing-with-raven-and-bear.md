          Original tales inspired by Native American and Norwegian folklore that
          highlight the wisdom of the divine natural world <br /><br />• Shares
          unique stories about Earth Medicine and animal magic, inspired by the
          author’s unusual Native American (Hopi) and Norwegian upbringing
          <br /><br />• Interwoven with ancient teachings and everyday practical
          applications of Earth Medicine, such as grounding and dream
          interpretation <br /><br />• Each tale is beautifully illustrated with
          the author’s original art, which promotes spiritual understanding and
          the power of the Earth’s healing properties <br /><br />• Paper with
          French flaps <br /><br />Drawing on both her Native American (Hopi)
          heritage and her Norwegian upbringing, renowned mystic and intuitive
          healer Sonja Grace shares original wisdom tales, received through her
          heart and soul, to take you on a journey into the magic of Raven and
          Bear and the healing power of Earth Medicine. <br /><br />Featuring
          Sonja’s distinctive and beautiful artwork, each story is embedded with
          ancient teachings to inspire you to live closer to the Earth. The
          fables include powerful examples of animal magic and everyday,
          practical applications of Earth Medicine, such as simple energy
          exercises, dream interpretations, Earth Medicine prayers and
          meditations, and using medicinal plants to manage negative energies.
          As background to the stories, Sonja reveals parallels between Norse
          mythology and Native American traditions and explores the symbology of
          animals and the recurring central theme of the tension between light
          and darkness. In Norse myth, the great god Odin, for instance, is
          often accompanied by Ravens. These birds are considered manifestations
          of the Valkyries, the goddesses who brought brave soldiers to
          Valhalla, while in Native American traditions, the Raven is viewed as
          a trickster or messenger, a magical creature with the ability to
          shapeshift into a human or animal, yet also portrayed as a hero
          overcoming adversity. The Bear on the other hand can embody the healer
          who grounds our energy and removes illness or can represent the inner
          part of us that has faith. In one fable, Sonja brings Bear to life as
          a mythical creature singing songs to bring in the light, reflecting
          the powerful lesson that by using our voice and speaking the truth we
          can hold darkness at bay. Throughout all of the stories, Raven and
          Bear teach us to be responsible for our actions and develop spiritual
          accountability. <br /><br />By sharing these tales of Earth Medicine,
          Sonja offers not only a path of reconnection with the Earth but also
          medicine for the soul. She shows how the Earth works in unity within
          herself and provides a warehouse of knowledge for all who live upon
          her.
