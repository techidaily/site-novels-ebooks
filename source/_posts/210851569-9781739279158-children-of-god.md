            Book 3 of the Trilogy, 'He heals the Broken-hearted', 'CHILDREN OF
            GOD:CONFORMED TO THE LIFE-GIVING CROSS IN JOY AND HOPE IN ETERNAL
            LIFE' invites the reader into the more purified path of Marina. She
            longs to live for God, now major false gods of trauma have been
            stripped away. &nbsp;We see His Love for Marina, providing healing
            and solace to her humanity, At the same time building her to grow in
            grace to write the books He desires, and to continue in Love with
            the on-line work, building women in faith.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Marina is kept largely in solitude in the sea-side flat despite her
            desire for company. But the morning waves, and daily input of birds
            blesses and feeds her.&nbsp;She increasingly focusses on the Writing
            and on line-work building and encouraging faith and new awareness of
            the Truth of God's Kingdom and Eternal Life.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            A year on He warns one Sunday, 'I'm going to give you a New
            Heart'.&nbsp;And this happens on the way to church, through release
            of some destructive bitterness, and repentance that the pain behind
            this had not been brought to Him. A changed heart was the
            result.&nbsp;She was willingly and lovingly&nbsp;re-committing
            whole-heartedly to the Church.&nbsp;After Liturgy, on her regular
            visit to her elderly friend, she found herself offering to move into
            the friend's house to be her companion. Marina's Spiritual Father
            gave them a blessing after 8 days trial.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            'Truly I had a new heart. I was filled with tenderness and
            compassion.&nbsp;Kindness and desire to Love her in Christ, poured
            out of me.&nbsp;I knew I needed to love her and pray for her to be
            prepared for death.&nbsp;And God provided for her cry of the heart
            sooner than we anticipated. One Sunday (2 weeks before Christmas)
            she had 3 falls between 3pm and 8 pm leading to her admittance to
            hospital, eventually, as an emergency.&nbsp;They found a severe
            brain haemorrhage because of which they expected she would die in 24
            hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            But God wanted her to die at peace, and through healing prayer, she
            was able to go through a week of reconciliation with family via
            WhatsApp video call, and in-person visits from members of her church
            family. And yes she suffered trials on 'end of life care' but she
            never lost 'her mind' - it simply turned more and more to His
            Presence and Trust in His Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            She died after I returned to her after church on the following
            Sunday. She was unutterably at peace- having had a peaceful night,
            and died in a peaceful sleep as if she had simply passed through a
            door that was open to her. A tiny breath was all I heard.... like a
            door closing quietly.'
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            And in this new phase of change, Marina was blessed to continue with
            Book 2 writing and planning, and doing what was needed for the Power
            of Attorney to help him start to deal with the house.&nbsp;But until
            Jean's funeral and memorial were over by the end of January, and
            Book 2 was published by the middle of February, Marina did not start
            to focus on her official homelessness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work of God in enabling Marina to find and move to a flat,
            before Easter, and use Holy Week to return to the completion of Book
            3, completes the story of living as a 'Child of God' and in effect
            'counting every trial a blessing'.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            She continues to face pain and fight the good fight against all the
            lies she has lived with, and still encounters.&nbsp;Yet in the midst
            of her human insecurity, God reveals His kindness and while at
            church, spoke a prophetic voice through her, and the purpose He has
            in bringing dark to the Light through a PhD 'Don't Weep for Me, Weep
            for Yourselves'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, living for Christ as a Child of God, was never promised to
            be easy- but the Joy of being His and Living in the Eternal Life of
            His Word and Spirit readily completes the book which was finished on
            Easter Morning.&nbsp;Indeed Christ is Risen.

            inadequate methods of control so that Christ can "burrow" deep into
            our despair to create a place of springs where before we had only a
            valley of tears (Ps. 84:6).' </span
