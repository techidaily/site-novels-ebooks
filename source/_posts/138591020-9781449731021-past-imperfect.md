          Jules Mullins is, in all respects, a normal grounded
          twenty-somethingwith one exception. Since she was a small child, shes
          dreamed about a group of people shes never meta violent bunch who
          speak barely discernable English, wear peculiar clothing, and
          completely ignore her. <br /><br />She learned early on not to discuss
          her dreams. Adults would pat her on the head and tell her she had
          quite the imagination, while other children just found her stories
          creepy. As the years passed, her dreams became more frequent and
          intense. Jules worried that she might be losing her sanity.
          <br /><br />Then she met Claire Wilder, a new age bookstore owner with
          an entirely different viewpoint: Jules wasnt dreaming; she was
          remembering a life she lived almost 500 years ago. Claire is also an
          old soul. The quest to discover their identities in centuries past
          leads them on a metaphysical mystery tour they never forget!

            >Reviews on Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Westbow Press about Past
            Imperfect:</strong
          >
          <br /><br />A real page turner, a very well written book - exciting,
          suspenseful, creative. Was a very GREAT READ. Well worth your time.
          <br /><br /><strong>Engaging - Imaginative!</strong> <br />This story
          captivates you from the first - you care about the characters and miss
          them between readings. You want to go visit the sites they explore and
          walk with them through their past memories. I would and have
          recommended this book to others looking for a good supernatural
          adventure. <br /><br />Linda Thayer gives such a great descriptive
          narrative about sixteenth-century England. The characters in this book
          were people that lived ordinary lives in present-day America, but
          after taking a trip to England wonder if reincarnation does exist as
          they remember, through dreams, the parts they played in Henry VIII's
          court. The story places you right at the heart of it all as these
          characters ask themselves, "am I who I think I am?" It sure does make
          one think, and wonder if there was another "me" in another life.

            >Truly Creative Writing - A Startling Story</strong
          >
          <br />Within the first few pages, I forgot I was reading. This story
          of a repeating dream, of returning home to where you have never been,
          the intersection of personalities before words -- this is the fun of
          Past Imperfect. I was scared and delighted. Thayer's story is fresh, a
          historical and eerie thriller. I hope this book finds more readers. It
          would make a great movie!
