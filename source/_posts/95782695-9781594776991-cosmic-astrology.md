          Combining Chinese Taoist astrology, Western zodiac astrology, and
          birth destiny cards to develop your innate talents and transform your
          negative traits <br />
          <br />• Includes charts to discover your Chinese animal year, your
          Western zodiac sun sign, your moon sign, and your birth destiny card
          as well as those of your friends, lovers, relatives, and colleagues
          <br />
          <br />• Provides insightful and accurate descriptions for each animal
          year, zodiac sun sign, and birth card as well as each year and sun
          sign combination and each sun and moon sign combination <br />
          <br />• Offers career suggestions based on your innate gifts and
          relationship advice on which animals, sign combos, and birth cards to
          seek out and which to avoid <br />
          <br />With your first breath of life, you take in the energy pattern
          radiated by the sun, moon, and stars at that moment in time and space.
          This internal energy pattern underlies your persona--your behavioral
          patterns, personality traits, and life’s path. Understanding these
          underlying patterns enables you to balance and transform your negative
          traits and highlight and develop your innate talents. <br />
          <br />Blending Eastern and Western astrological methods, Master Mantak
          Chia and William Wei explain how to identify the five key patterns of
          your internal energy persona based on the year, month, and day of your
          birth. Including charts to discover your Chinese animal year, your
          Western zodiac sun sign, your moon sign, and your birth destiny card,
          they explore how each of these astrological profiles interact to build
          your unique persona and provide profoundly accurate descriptions for
          each year and sun sign combination, each sun and moon sign
          combination, and each birth card. Each description also includes
          career recommendations to best utilize your innate gifts and
          relationship advice on which animals, sign combinations, and birth
          cards to seek out and which to avoid. Not only useful for personal
          insight and self-development, this new astrological approach can also
          be used to understand the underlying energetic personality patterns of
          your lovers, friends, relatives, and colleagues.

          “This might seem like an odd topic for these two Taoist superstars to
          invest their time in, but there is much esoteric information provided
          along with the day–to–day aspects. The premise behind the book is that
          the better we understand our birth ‘imprint’ the easier it will be to
          develop into the spiritual being we are meant to be. Whether your
          goals are lofty or mundane, there is plenty in the book to keep your
          interest. Buy it for fun and study it when you are ready.”
