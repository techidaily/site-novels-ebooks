          Maine has a rich supernatural history and ghost stories from the state
          are as varied as they are prolific. Freelance writer and reporter Tom
          Verde first became interested in such eerie occurrences while
          researching first-hand encounters with ghosts for a series of public
          radio programs. This book recounts some of the spine-tingling tales he
          uncovered in his research, including:<br />•The dagger-wielding shade
          who terrorized a Portland couple<br />•The murdered Indian who
          revisited Means’s Tavern<br />•Famed diva Lillian Nordica, whose voice
          still echoes through the Farmington auditorium named in her honor<br />•The
          hostile spirit who tried to frighten the tenants out of an Orrington
          house<br />•Even an entire phantom ship, bound eternally for
          Freeport<br /><br />These are not fictitious creations of literary
          imagination. People from all walks of life—including many who were
          positive they would never believe in ghosts—attest to these
          encounters.<br />

          Tom Verde has updated his Maine Ghosts and Legends of 1989 with a new
          preface and four new reports from around the state and across
          time…Each chapter is well-researched and unbiased, citing references,
          interviews and the reporter’s flair for the facts. Though not every
          question can be answered, the possibilities are there for all to see
          and decide—or not—on their own. A fun and informative read, to be
          sure!
