          "Margot Datz is a mythical wisp herself, a wood nymph who walks this
          earth and paints by the mile. She lives by the sea, surviving on
          detail, the exotic, and on beauty. Her antennae are always high. She
          listens, she digests, and she pontificates with care and humor. If
          anyone in this dimension has heard messages from the merfolk, Margot
          would be the one." -- Patience Brewster, author, artist, and creator
          of the Krinkles™

        </h4>
        <p>
          Margot Datz is an in-demand painter, illustrator, and mural artist
          based in Martha's Vineyard. Her work has appeared in
          <i>House and Gardens</i>, <i>Home Magazine</i>, <i>InStyle</i>, the
          <i
            >New York Times, Rolling Stone, Publishers Weekly, The Boston Globe,
            Newsweek</i
          >, and many regional publications, as well as CNN and NPR's "All
          Things Considered." Dustin Hoffman bought her first piece of art.
          Other clients include Diane Sawyer, Garth Brooks, Billy Joel, and
          Carly Simon. Datz has maintained a close creative affiliation with
          Carly Simon, designing and moralizing her nightclub Hot Tin Roof and
          her homes, and illustrating four of her children's books, with
          Jacqueline Onnassis as editor.<br /><br />Datz began her career as a
          sculptress and exhibited regularly in one-woman and group shows in
          Manhattan, New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, and
          Martha's Vineyard. In 1978 she established Margot Datz Designs,
          specializing in murals and architectural <i>trompe l'oeil</i>,
          decorative painting, and interior design. She has created murals for a
          number of children's hospitals, dozens of prominent businesses,
          hundreds of homes, and the Martha's Vineyard Steamship Authority Ferry
          Terminal, which receives over one million tourists and travelers
          annually. Datz also creates original paintings, exhibits annually, and
          is a well-established island painter.<br />
          <br />Enamored and bemused by the New England region, Datz developed
          her own indigenous iconography based on lighthouses, sailors,
          fishermen, mermaids, and their interplay with the great blue sea. Her
          archetypal approach to her surroundings addresses humorously and
          compassionately contemporary living and loving dilemmas as modern
          folk.
