          <p>
            For the first time in history, a Pleiadian group has invited a human
            couple to join an interplanetary team for helping the evolution of
            humanity. Cullen Baird Smith and Pia&nbsp;Orleane, Ph.D, acting as
            ambassadors to the Pleiadians, bring Laarkmaa's inspiring and heart
            warming messages of hope, love, and peace to all those who are
            willing to listen. Through recorded conversations with this
            Pleiadian group, Smith and Orleane share Laarkmaa's wisdom about the
            coming changes, the illusion of time, the future of technology, our
            innate ability to heal ourselves, the power of our thoughts, and
            information about who is here to guide us through this auspicious
            time. Laarkmaa is equally interested in speaking to us and hearing
            our responses. The dialogue includes their questions for humanity,
            such as "What do humans need?" "How can we support you?" and "How
            can we help you choose the right path?" The ensuing conversations
            bring revelatory insights about human emotions, telepathic
            communications, and our own divinity. The Pleiadians tell us that we
            have a choice in changing the course of our own evolution. Will we
            make the right choice?

          "This is one of the most thought provoking books I have read in years!
          It presents powerful insights and observations of our situation on
          Earth and practical information about how to move toward a brighter
          future for humanity. I can't wait to see what is in their next book!"

          "Conversations With Laarkmaa' has given me great insight into
          everything that I have been doing to evolve. The information is
          elegant, simply put, and relevant for anyone on a spiritual quest or
          self-awareness journey. I highly recommend that you run, not walk, to
          your local book store or www.laarkmaa.com to buy a copy and begin
          reading. Thank you to the authors, Pia and Cullen. Amazing work!!!!"

          "I have experienced first hand the Truth and power of Laarkmaa in
          England while standing in a sacred stone circle where Laarkmaa
          disclosed the holy name and meaning of this ancient place. It made my
          hair stand on end. Pia and Cullen are extraordinary inter-dimensional
          communicators! "Ron Russell, Visionary Artist, Photographer, Author,

          encouraging message thta there is still hope for humans, if we choose
          to act wisely and listen to the voice of love." Cheryl Fracasso,

          "This is a remarkable account of what some psychologists call an
          exceptional human experience. The messages are articulate,
          provocative, and hopeful." Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., Author and
          Professor of Psychology, Saybrook University.
