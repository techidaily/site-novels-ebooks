          • Explains the techniques used to achieve trance in seiðr, how to
          journey in the Nine Realms, and the different gods and spirits you may
          encounter<br /><br />• Discusses the tools of seiðr, such as the seiðr
          staff and hood, and how to create them, empower them, and care for
          them<br /><br />• Details Norse divination methods, ways to alter
          fate, healing techniques, the use of protective songs, and the
          practice of Norse soul retrieval<br /><br />While Norse rune work is
          well known, there is another major ancient Norse magical practice:
          seiðr (pronounced "sayther"), a form of trance spirit work and
          divination. Although seiðr is often considered an ancient form of
          witchcraft, recent archaeological evidence suggests it is more closely
          related to shamanism.<br /><br />In this practical guide to seiðr,
          Dean Kirkland, Ph.D., reconstructs the magical and shamanic techniques
          of the seiðr priest or priestess using the sagas and other literature
          from the Viking Age, tools found in the archaeological record, and
          surviving indigenous shamanic traditions. He addresses the
          misconception that seiðr was reserved only for women and shows how
          anyone called to this work can practice it in the modern world. He
          discusses the tools of seiðr—how to create them, empower them, and
          care for them—and he explores the use of protective songs (varðlokur)
          that involve forming bonds with spirits, a practice he likens to the
          medicine songs of Amazonian shamans.<br /><br />Looking at trance
          journeying in the Nine Realms of the Norse cosmos, the author
          discusses the different gods and spirits the seiðr practitioner may
          encounter in the Upper, Middle, and Lower realms. He shares methods of
          divination using the seiðr staff as well as ways to alter ørlög, or
          fate, through spiritual work. Discussing soul-healing techniques in
          seiðr, the author looks in depth at the Norse shamanic practices of
          soul retrieval and reintegration of the soul parts. He then explores
          the role of seiðr in death, dying, and dealing with the dead,
          including work with the valkyries and the ancestors.<br /><br />Presenting
          a historically based handbook for contemporary heathens, this book
          offers a practical path for anyone seeking to explore Norse trance
          magic and mysticism.

          “In this captivating work, Kirkland delves into the realms of seiðr
          with a thesis that is truly wonderful, unraveling the intricacies of
          its power. Despite the limited recorded information on seiðr,
          Kirkland’s meticulous research shines through. He skillfully uncovers
          the available knowledge and, through insightful comparisons with
          magical practices from diverse cultures, presents a guide to attaining
          the magic for purposes such as healing, divination, traversing the
          three spheres, and initiation. For those of us who engage in shamanic
          trance from varied perspectives and cultural backgrounds,
          <i>Seiðr Magic</i> emerges as an invaluable resource.”
