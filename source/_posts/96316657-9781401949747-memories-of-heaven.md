          Dr. Wayne W. Dyer&nbsp;and co-author&nbsp;Dee Garnes&nbsp;had often
          talked about how the ones who know the most about God are those who
          have just recently been wrapped in the arms of the Divine, our infants
          and toddlers. In fact, Dee had an interaction with her own young son
          that convinced her of this. Curious about this phenomenon, Wayne and
          Dee decided to issue an invitation to parents all over the world to
          share their experiences. The overwhelming response they received
          prompted them to put together this book, which includes the most
          interesting and illuminating of these stories in which very young
          children speak about their remembrances before they were born.<br /><br />
          It seems that infants and toddlers often arrive here with memories of
          their lifetimes in the spirit world and frequently provide evidence of
          this to their immediate families. They tell of dialogues with God,
          give evidence that they themselves had a hand in picking their own
          parents, speak about long-deceased family members they knew while in
          the dimension of Spirit, verify past-life recollections, and speak
          eloquently and accurately of a kind of Divine love that exists beyond
          this physical realm--and even of times when telepathic communication
          took place, as well as the ability to decide just when they would come
          here to Earth.<br /><br />
          This fascinating book encourages parents and grandparents to take a
          much more active role in communicating with their new arrivals . . .
          and to realize that there is far more to this earthly experience than
          what we perceive with our five senses.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Affectionately called the "father of motivation" by his fans, Dr.
          Wayne W. Dyer was an internationally renowned author, speaker, and
          pioneer in the field of self-development. Over the four decades of his
          career, he wrote more than 40 books (21 of which became New York Times
          bestsellers), created numerous audio programs and videos, and appeared
          on thousands of television and radio shows. His books Manifest Your
          Destiny, Wisdom of the Ages, There’s a Spiritual Solution to Every
          Problem, and the New York Times bestsellers 10 Secrets for Success and
          Inner Peace, The Power of Intention, Inspiration, Change Your
          Thoughts—Change Your Life, Excuses Begone!, Wishes Fulfilled, and I
          Can See Clearly Now were all featured as National Public Television
          specials. Wayne held a doctorate in educational counseling from Wayne
          State University, had been an associate professor at St. John’s
          University in New York, and honored a lifetime commitment to learning
          and finding the Higher Self. In 2015, he left his body, returning to
          Infinite Source to embark on his next adventure. Website:
          www.DrWayneDyer.comDee Garnes currently resides in Maui with her
          husband and two children. When she is not chasing her two-year-old son
          around or caring for her infant daughter, she enjoys long-distance
          swims in the ocean, paddle-boarding, and hiking. Her longest hike to
          date spanned 50 days across the 500-mile Colorado Trail, where she
          found that her heart was not only in the mountains, but also in the
          ocean—and in truly healing and helping others. She has worked in the
          healing-arts field as a massage therapist for over 13 years, and is
          currently an assistant to Dr. Wayne Dyer.
