            >An in-depth study into the cutting-edge science of ‘sensing’ the
            future, or precognition—from a cognitive neuroscientist and the
            bestselling author of <i>The Dream Dictionary</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In this groundbreaking book, bestselling author Theresa Cheung joins
          forces with cognitive neuroscientist Julia Mossbridge, PhD, Director
          of the Innovation Lab at The Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS).
          Together they reveal revolutionary new research showing that sensing
          the future is possible; they also provide practical tools and
          techniques you can use to develop your own powers of precognition.<br /><br />
          Precognition is the scientific name for the&nbsp;knowledge or
          perception of the future, obtained through extrasensory means. Often
          called ‘premonition’, precognition is the most frequently reported of
          all extrasensory perception (ESP) experiences, occurring most often in
          dreams. It may also occur spontaneously in waking visions, auditory
          hallucinations, flashing thoughts entering the mind, the sense of
          “knowing” and physiological changes. Combining science and practice,
          Theresa and Dr Julia unravel the mystery of precognition. The book
          will cover:&nbsp;<br /><br />
          • What precognition is and the different types, clearly explaining the
          cutting-edge science, including what is known and what is still a
          mystery&nbsp;<br /><br />
          •&nbsp;The most common premonitions that people experience and why,
          including examples from around the world&nbsp;<br /><br />
          •&nbsp;Experimental tools to help you cultivate precognition
          experiences to help get useful information for your life<br /><br />
          •&nbsp;Case studies included throughout, with supporting scientific
          evidence offered alongside to provide validation and explanation<br /><br />
          •&nbsp;Personal experiences of the authors, detailing how premonition
          has shaped their lives and interviews with leading scientists and
          experts in the field

          "Dr Julia Mossbridge and co-author Theresa Cheung show us that our
          everyday notions of time do not reflect the scientific reality of how
          time can work in our lives. They dare to examine the so-called anomaly
          of precognition in a clear-headed way, hopeful that as a society we
          can build teams of "Positive Precogs" who globally move us toward
          positive events and away from negative ones. This book is a major
          contribution in our understanding of reality and the dormant potential
          for the so-called supernormal that exists within all of us. Read it
          and discover the power of time within your mind."<br /><br />—Deepak
          Chopra, M.D., author of <i>The Healing Self<br /><br /></i>"The
          Premonition Code addresses an unprecedented shift in scientific
          understanding, all over a refined assessment of the nature of
          consciousness. At its core lie peculiar and unexpected aspects of time
          itself, and of causal relationships and modes of knowing that defy
          conventional explanation. The book is not only a sophisticated and
          comprehensive presentation of the science behind this world-changing
          revolution: It also provides a fascinating and practical toolbox to
          aid conscious beings in personally exploring these mind-bending
          concepts and applying them positively in their own lives. Thanks to
          Theresa and Dr Mossbridge, a future based in our loftiest dreams has
          never been more accessible!”<br />&nbsp;<i

            Living in a Mindful Universe </i
          >and <i>Proof of Heaven<br /><br /></i><br />"It seems that the ‘other
          side’ might be in ‘another time.’ In this book we have a mystic and a
          hard-core scientist using fascinating and accessible examples to
          demonstrate the remarkable possibilities of precognition and how to
          access it in your own life."<br /><br /><i>—</i>New York Times
          bestselling author and spiritual medium, James van Praagh<br /><br /><br />While
          reading the Premonition Code I felt how my mind set steadily
          transformed. This easily accessible book on the human capacity to
          foresee future events presents personal accounts as well as recent
          scientific insight. What is more, it is about a practical mind
          technique, probed and tested over the last decades, which might enable
          us to better sense the future. This book could become the I Ching of
          our times. <br /><br /><i>—</i>Marc Wittmann, Institute for Frontier
          Areas of Psychology and Mental Health, Germany<br /><br /><br />"Dr.
          Julia Mossbridge and Theresa Cheung, in Premonition Code, have written
          an excellent and compelling book that will present the reader with the
          very latest research in nonlocal consciousness, as well as a way to
          use these findings to improve their own lives. I recommend it."
          <br /><br /><i>—</i>Stephan A. Schwartz, Author, Scientist, and
          Futurist, The 8 Laws of Change, 2016 winner of the Nautilus book award
          for social change<i><br /></i><br />"I am excited about&nbsp;The
          Premonition Code&nbsp;because it exhibits a long overdue blending of
          the scientific and the spiritual fields in the examination of
          precognition. Where so many have looked at these disciplines as
          enemies, Dr. Julia Mossbridge and Theresa Chung realize that they
          compliment each other beautifully. Attention all truth seekers,
          whether you're a skeptic or believer, you are in for an amazing
          journey. Read this important work and unlock&nbsp;The Premonition
          Code." <i><br /><br /> </i><br /><i>—</i>Jim Harold, Author and Host
