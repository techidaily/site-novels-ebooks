            Book Two of The Pulse of Creation series continues your tour of the

            Ernest L. Norman's interdimensional concepts.

            the instruction. You'll learn about the energy origins of Earth's
            viruses, the operations that separate destructively entangled souls,

            "There's science in everything," Leonardo da Vinci tells us from his
            vantage point on Eros, a higher-dimensional world that focuses on
            developing and teaching an interdimensional science that benefits
            humanity, wherever we reside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through mental contacts carried out by author Ernest L. Norman over
            a period of weeks, Leonardo is soon joined by others among his
            afterlife colleagues who step up to the mic, including Nikola Tesla,
            Hilarion/Krishna, Leonardo's biocentric polarity Iona, William
            Shakespeare, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Robert
            Louis Stevenson, Confucius, Helena Blavatsky, Lao-Tse, Maha Chohan,
            Michael Faraday/Pericles, Rene Descartes, Friedrich Nietzsche,
            Gamaliel, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you read, you will be attuned to their higher-frequency
            energies impinged in these transmissions for your healing benefit.
            You may discover keys to your future, insight into your own past
            lives, or a new awareness of the interdimensional science that
            guides your existence on Earth-and beyond!

          <p><strong>From the Author:</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong>&nbsp;</strong>"Far below me on the plain, I saw another
            wonderful and beautiful city. This one was laid out like a huge
            wheel with seven huge spokes, with a very wide rim. In the center,
            or the hub, was another huge domed temple and, like the others
            before it, it was of the glittering, glowing, pulsating crystal, and
            even much more so. The atmosphere or air, if we can term it such,
            seemed to be swirling with this infusion of wonderful light. There
            was no sun overhead. The light seemed to come from everywhere about
            us and [Nikola] Tesla told me that there was no sun on this planet;
            instead, the light came directly from the central vortex, which
            earth people call God."-Ernest L. Norman, on his visit to the
            higher-dimensional plane of Eros

          "Rather than new discoveries and works on my journey contrasting or
          replacing [Ernest] Norman's teachings, his framework of our existence
          seems to not only hold firm, but provides a scaffolding wherein the
          other authors' and teachers' works continually affirm the truth that
          he so humbly brought to our world."-Liam Lukasik, Curator/Editor,

          "In 45 years of re-reading this book, I am always amazed at the new
          gems of information I missed the last time around. It's as if the book
          serves as a link to my Teachers on the Inner and they highlight
          certain passages that are relevant to my life right now."-Lianne
