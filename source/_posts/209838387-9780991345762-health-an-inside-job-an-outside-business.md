          Health; An Inside Job and Outside Business, was written in support of
          the documentary The Business of Disease produced by Sonia Barrett.
          Each chapter has been a contribution by those featured in the film.
          These expansive minds bring to our attention the hypnosis of
          marketing, belief systems and the body's ability to heal. Not only do
          they shed light on the disinformation presented as health care but
          they have integrated science as a means of clarifying the
          possibilities which exists in better understanding the inner
          technology of spirit, mind and body. Through a holistic approach in
          dealing with dis-ease, options and insights are presented as readers
          are encouraged to examine the whole person. The marketing of dis-ease
          is examined along with the genetic and social programs from which our
          choices and experiences are shaped. We are encouraged to be unafraid
          to take responsibility for our bodies, our spirits and our
          minds.Collectively they bridge the gap between science and
          spirituality in a way that truly brings to light what is possible.
          These are voices of freedom for those ready to leap into a new level
          of inner freedom. External change begins with an inner revolution.
          They share with us such awareness:Physicist, Dr. Amit Goswami uses
          quantum physics to explain the healing power of integral medicine. He
          poses another question, "Where is the discernible signature of [your]
          choice then?" Where is the seat of your power to create?Dr. Romeo
          Brooks reminds us that; "Simply put, disease is a struggle. It is a
          struggle that the body engages in on its own behalf. It is a struggle
          of intent and precision. No matter what it looks like, no matter what
          course of action the body takes, no matter how radical the symptoms
          may appear, its survival is at hand." Through these pages the struggle
          in your own life becomes clear and perhaps providing you with insight
          into your own body's dis-ease.
