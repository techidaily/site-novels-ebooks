            >A rare glimpse into heaven, hell, and previous lives—Dr. Rajiv
            Parti’s near-death experience brought him on a journey through the
            afterworld, leading to a spiritual awakening that transformed his
            career, his lifestyle, and his most fundamental beliefs.</b
          ><br /><br />Before his near-death experience, Dr. Rajiv Parti was a
          wealthy man of science with a successful career as the Chief of
          Anesthesiology at the Bakersfield Heart Hospital in California. He
          demanded the same success from his son, whose failures provoked
          episodes of abuse from Dr. Parti. All in all, Dr. Parti was the last
          man to believe in heaven or hell—that is, until he saw them with his
          own eyes.<br />
          <br />
          When Dr. Parti had his near-death experience on the operating table,
          he first watched his own operation from the ceiling—even recalling a
          joke told by his doctors during his surgery. He was greeted by
          archangels and his deceased father who led him through the tortures of
          hell and revealed the toxic cycle of violence that has plagued his
          family for generations. He even reviewed the struggles of his previous
          lives which, in many ways, reflected those he still faced in the
          present. Finally, he experienced heaven. From the angels, he learned
          lessons of spiritual health that they insisted he bring down to
          earth—to do so, Dr. Parti knew he had to change his ways.<br />
          <br />
          After his near-death experience, Dr. Parti awoke a new man. He gave
          away his mansion, quit his career, opened a wellness clinic, and
          completely turned around his relationships with his family. To this
          day, he still converses with angels and spreads their wisdom to the
          living.<br />
          <br />
          In this remarkable “spiritual wake-up call” (Suzanne Giesemann, author
          of <i>Messages of Hope</i>), Dr. Parti provides rare details of
          heaven, hell, the afterlife, and angels and offers you the opportunity
          to attain peace and live a better life here on Earth.
