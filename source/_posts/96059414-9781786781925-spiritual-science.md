            ancient spirituality.</b

          ><br /><br />
          It is often assumed that there are two ways of interpreting the world:
          a rational scientific way, or an irrational religious way. Mindfulness
          expert, Steve Taylor, shows that there is a third possibility—a
          spiritual, or “panspiritist”, view of reality that transcends both
          conventional science and religion, recognizes spirit or consciousness
          as fundamental, and answers many of the riddles that neither can
          explain.<br /><br />
          Here, Taylor puts forward the evidence for a spiritual view of reality
          and examines the development and consequences
          of&nbsp;the&nbsp;materialist model. Drawing on the insights of
          philosophers, physicists, mystics, as well as spiritual traditions and
          indigenous cultures, he also&nbsp;systematically shows how a
          ‘panspiritist’ view can explain many puzzling aspects of science and
          the world such as:<br /><br />
          •&nbsp;human consciousness<br />
          •&nbsp;altruism<br />
          •&nbsp;near-death experiences<br />
          •&nbsp;telepathy and pre-cognition<br />
          •&nbsp;quantum physics<br />
          •&nbsp;the placebo effect<br />
          •&nbsp;neuroplasticity<br /><br />
          A compelling argument for a new vision of reality,
          <i>Spiritual Science </i>offers a bright vision of the world as sacred
          and interconnected, and of human life as meaningful and purposeful.

          "With elegance and lucidity, Steve Taylor explains why spiritual
          science is the only hope for humanity. A science based on the
          superstition of matter as fundamental reality could lead to our
          extinction but a science grounded in the understanding of
          consciousness as a fundamental reality - as described by this book -
          could be our saving grace." <br /><br />—Deepak Chopra, MD Chopra
          Foundation <br /><br />
          "Materialism is dead. It just doesn't know it.&nbsp;<i
            >Spiritual Science</i
          >
          shows the mechanistic worldview is&nbsp;passé and
          that&nbsp;the&nbsp;science that once seemed to&nbsp;support it has
          well and&nbsp;truly&nbsp;moved on.&nbsp;Steve Taylor's book is
          a&nbsp;very readable and inspiring guide to where we are heading as a
          culture."<br /><br />—Gary Lachman
          <i>Lost Knowledge of the Imagination</i> <br /><br /><i
            >"As I read this book, I kept sighing with relief. At long last, a
            thoughtful and accessible treatment of the false divide between
            science and spirituality. By exploring a series of puzzles, Taylor
            shows how the pieces of our world fit together, if we are willing to
            take a breath and look at it anew."</i
          >

            <i>The Premonition Code</i></i
          >
          <br /><br />"In this important book, Steve Taylor convincingly argues
          that the materialist paradigm has run its course and that the evidence
          from anomalous experiences must be acknowledged. Taylor shows how a
          panspiritist approach not only eloquently explains anomalous phenomena
          but can lead to exciting possibilities for the evolution of humankind
          and the planet. These issues affect each one of us; it is time we all
          sat up and took note." <br /><br />—Dr. Penny Sartori, author of
          <i>The Wisdom of Near-Death Experiences</i><br /><br /><br /><i>"</i
          >This is the best book on the mind-body problem I have yet to read. If
          you care about the plight of the human condition, and ever wondered
          about the mysteries of the human mind...not to be missed."<br /><br />—Michael
          Grosso, PH.D&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<i>The Man Who Could Fly&nbsp;</i
          ><br /><br />"In his acknowledgments Steve Taylor generously describes
          himself as being inspired to write a popular version of our book<i
            >&nbsp;Irreducible Mind</i
          >. In fact he has accomplished much more than this. In a highly
          readable account of some of the issues and "rogue phenomena" we
          discuss in our book, he also takes on difficult new topics such as
          altruism and evolution, making crystal clear why our struggling
          postmodern civilization so urgently needs an expanded scientific
          worldview compatible with human spirituality."<br /><br />—Edward F.
          and Emily W. Kelly, lead authors of&nbsp;<i
            >Irreducible Mind<br /><br /><br />“</i
          >A brilliant and eloquent book that is essential reading for our
          times.”<br /><br />-David Lorimer,&nbsp;<i>Paradigm Explorer</i
          >.<br /><br />“A world-changing opus, a great book… Scientific
          materialism has foisted highly effective blinders on our
          world-at-large. Future historians will likely be incredulous at the
          century-long gap between the advent of investigation into quantum
          physics and any meaningful assimilation of its revelations into the
          mainstream scientific culture.&nbsp;<i>Spiritual Science</i
          >&nbsp;expertly argues the evidence for the primacy of consciousness,
          an inevitable realization that will engender the greatest revolution
          in the history of human thought. Science will ultimately ripen through
          the influence of our spiritual nature. Highly recommended!”<br /><br />-Eben
