          <b>A psychomagic journey to awaken lucid dream consciousness</b
          ><br /><br />• Presents effective exercises and techniques, inspired
          by ancient texts, to deepen your personal awareness of the dream state
          and experiment with dreams for healing and divinatory purposes<br /><br />•
          Each initiatory chapter includes a psychodramatic narrative designed
          to generate the perfect dream for each stage in the initiation<br /><br />•
          Explains how dreaming has influenced cultural, religious, and
          spiritual thinking<br /><br />• Includes access to a seven-part
          hypnagogic guided journey recording<br /><br />Invoking
          Mnemosyne—Greek goddess of memory and eloquence, daughter of Heaven
          and Earth, mother of the Muses, and archetypal deity of the Asklepion
          dream temple tradition—this book initiates you into full dream
          consciousness, offering a lucid-dreaming ritual experience in the
          spirit of the Mystery Schools of antiquity.<br /><br />Sharing her
          more than a decade of research on Sleep Temples and Mystery Schools of
          the Esoteric Tradition, lucid-dreaming instructor Sarah Janes explores
          the evolution of imagination, memory, and consciousness throughout the
          ages and proposes that dreams have been fundamental in the creation
          and development of culture. Dreams play an important role in ancestor
          worship, afterlife beliefs, animism, religion, and wis­dom traditions.
          Explaining how a conscious dream life is essential for self-discovery,
          deep integration, and healing, Sarah presents exercises, techniques,
          initiations, and seven guided audio meditations to help you explore
          the inner depths of your psyche. Sarah reveals how dreams offer us an
          opportunity to remember and directly experience our divinity, to
          transcend the limitations of our mortality and enter timeless imaginal
          realms. These realms, accessible through dreams, can help you to form
          a better under­standing of who you are.<br /><br />Employing the power
          of story to affect the mind and lay down new neural pathways—as if one
          were really living the story—Sarah connects each initiatory chapter
          with a psychodramatic narrative as well as a guided audio meditation.
          Using symbolism and powerful imagery, these stories, combined with her
          meditations, help you generate the perfect dreams for each stage in
          the initiation. And by becoming a better dreamer, you can make better,
          more aware decisions in your waking life.

        <p>
          “Sarah Janes’s <i>Initiation into Dream Mysteries</i> reads like a
          perfect dream. Not only through the vivid reanimation of the dream
          cults of antiquity but also through the mellifluous prose by which it
          is brought to life, the reader (or initiate) is taken on a special
          journey--as intellectually insightful as it is spiritually inspiring.
          The text is the synergy of a depth of knowledge and love for the
          world—mingled with the initiatory stories interspliced throughout,
          hypnotically elaborate and evocative--that will lift you up to taste
          that same awakening that was the intent of these very oneiric
          practices of old.”
