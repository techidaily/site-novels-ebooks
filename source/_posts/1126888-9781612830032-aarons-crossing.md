          <p>
            In 1991, as Linda Alice Dewey walked through an abandoned cemetery,
            she and a companion felt a presence. She returned to that graveyard
            over the next couple of years, hoping to reach out to that poor
            being, offering the words:
          </p>
          <p>"Whoever is here…my heart is with you.”</p>
          <p>
            Little did Linda know that those words would begin her relationship
            with Aaron Burke, a man who had died nearly 70 years earlier. Aaron
            followed Linda home that day from the graveyard. As she opened
            herself to this ghost she learned that he was stuck in a state of
            limbo, unable to cross over.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaron had been kidnapped by his father at age four and taken from
            Ireland to America where he was put to work. Hardened and embittered
            from his childhood, he did manage to find happiness, only to have it
            all slip away. Shortly after witnessing his own funeral, Aaron met
            other ghosts waiting for the time they could finally leave this
            state of limbo. Yet for decades he could only watch as the people he
            knew both in life and death crossed over, leaving him behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working together to find the closure Aaron needed, he and Linda
            became friends along the journey. Years after that first meeting and
            his subsequent crossing, Aaron returned to share the full story of
            his life--and afterlife--with Linda.
          </p>
          <p>
            This true ghost story gives hope and inspiration to all of us. Aaron
            shows us that, when seen as the big picture, everything makes sense.
            <i>Aaron's Crossing</i> sheds light on the mystery of dying,
            reassuring us that death is never the end of the story!
