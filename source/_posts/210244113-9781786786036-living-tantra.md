            >A practical manual on Tantra in all its aspects from one of the
            UK’s leading Tantra teachers. It’s firmly rooted in the ancient
            Indian tradition but the book shows via many practical exercises how
            Tantra can be applied to every aspect of our daily lives.</b
          ><br /><br />Tantra originated in India many centuries ago but it's
          uniquely placed to help people use real life as grist to the mill for
          spiritual transformation. The purpose of the book is to articulate
          what Tantra can be in our modern times and how it can be applied to
          all aspects of our everyday life. Traditionally Tantra was a path that
          brought spirituality out of the caves and monasteries and into the
          life of householders. It didn’t seek to separate sexuality and
          spirituality and to force people to make a choice but rather to
          integrate the life of family and relationship with spirituality. This
          includes sexuality but it’s not all about sexuality, and this is a
          rare book that applies Tantra to every aspect of life.<br /><br /><br />Living
          Tantra is a body of work that aims to bring the essence and core
          message of tantra into relevance for our contemporary life and society
          as a path of spiritual growth and human development. It’s based on her
          legendary workshops which book up via word of mouth and attracts
          attendees from across Europe and North America, especially Sweden,
          Austria, USA, Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic. The exercises
          here come out of these workshops and mean that we can benefit from
          this work in our own homes.<br />&nbsp;<br />The principles of Living
          Tantra are to use all life, all experience to learn and become more
          conscious of ourselves and the world around us, to care more for
          ourselves, each other and the world and to develop greater compassion.
          Tantra includes everything. It is “the weaving together of all that
          is”.<br />&nbsp;
