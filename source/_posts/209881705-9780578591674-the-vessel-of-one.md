            In The Vessel of ONE, Craig Lefebvre has brought through a very
            timely message for humanities awakening. It addresses the question
            that we silently ask ourselves each and every day. What is it all
            about and why am I here? The book you hold in your hands seeks to
            answer that inquiry. This book will open your mind to a much broader
            universe than you ever thought existed. Through the many channeled
            messages in this book you will learn how we are all related and the
            reason we think we are all separate. This message of ONE has been
            waiting for you. Welcome to the awakening.

          What do George Washington, Freddie Mercury, St. Germain, Archangel
          Melchizedek, the Pleiades and Albert Einstein have in common? Craig
          Lefebvre. In this book, Craig has published the first of many
          visitations and channellings he has received. Some messages were
          familiar to me, some were different perspectives of what I have been
          taught or know, some were new... but truth is truth, and it seems like
          we have to hear the messages over and over again to finally "get
          it"... right? RIGHT? And as we grow in our knowledge and
          understanding, we have to hear them again, for the messages grow with
          us, and reveal their deeper meanings. I have had the honor of meeting
          Craig a few times, and I can say this: what on earth can drive a man
          to write such a book? He's a genuinely nice guy, down to earth, family
          man, good sense of humor... the kind of fellow you really like to chat
          with on a grocery line, because you feel really good after spending a
          few minutes with him. Why would he risk exposing himself to ridicule
          and the online ugliness that crawls up to meet you when you dare
          publish? It can't be for the money, because honestly for most writers,
          there isn't any. You'd be appalled at how much income pouring your
          heart out will generate. Family acceptance? Well, you've got to be
          pretty brave to let your entire family and everyone you grew up with
          know that you receive messages from the departed/angels/star
          systems/ETs. The answer is simple: once he started to receive these
          messages, he recognized that the information was to be shared, and
          share he did. This little book is his gift to all of us. Buy it. Read
          it. Put it down for a few weeks and read it again. Thank you Craig for
          having the guts to step out of your comfort zone and publish. I look
          forward to the next installment.
