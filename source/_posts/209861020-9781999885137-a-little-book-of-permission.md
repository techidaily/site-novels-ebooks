            What if giving yourself permission to follow your dreams starts with
            becoming more aware of what you aren't required to do? &nbsp;How
            aware are you of the hidden list of all the have to's, shoulds,
            ought to's, and&nbsp;musts you've agreed to in your life? &nbsp;A
            Little Book of Permission is a&nbsp;curated list of things you don't
            have to do which takes the reader on a funny journey towards self
            determination and recognising&nbsp;choices we sometimes forget we
            have. &nbsp;It won't take you long to read. &nbsp;It isn't&nbsp;an
            exhaustive list that will instantly free&nbsp;you from all the
            obligations that we sometimes mistake for our choices. &nbsp;It will
            hopefully make you exhale a bit, laugh a couple of times, and
            perhaps ask yourself some questions about what it is you want to do
            with your short, precious time.

          <p>Praise for A Little Book of Permission:</p>
          <p>
            "A Little Book of Permission is&nbsp;the
            kind&nbsp;of&nbsp;book&nbsp;that sticks with you.&nbsp;It's poetic
            but not exactly&nbsp;a&nbsp;poem. The gift is in the message which
            lands like something the Dalai Lama would write but reads more like
            Dr. Seuss.&nbsp;It’s one&nbsp;of&nbsp;those books you grow up with
            and re-read at just the right moments.
            It’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;book&nbsp;for ages 10-100+."

            "Sourwine has crafted a meditation on letting go of our inner and
            outer critics. She gives us permission to be ourselves, and sets us
            free from the shackles of an uptight, controlling society. A
            liberating book that can be read over and over, or one line at a
            time to give yourself a new freedom every day."

          <p>
            <br />"The most amazing thing about this little book is the amount
            of encouragement and power it provides. It reminds me that it's ok
            to not do things. It's ok to take time out for myself, to not clean
            the house, to not do any of the other things on my never-ending to
            do list. I give myself permission to be me, all the time."

          <p>About the Author:</p>
          <p>
            SL Sourwine lives beside a shingle beach on the edge of the English
            Channel trying to keep all of the bits of her passions moving in
            approximately the same direction.&nbsp; This involves lots of
            walking with her Old English Sheepdog companion Alfred.&nbsp;
            Building a twenty-year career in international horse racing with
            only her passion for horses, the sport, and an English degree, her
            experiences ranged from being the volunteer flower gardener at the
            tiniest of courses in Saskatchewan, Canada to being involved with a
            winner at Royal Ascot.&nbsp; Going on to start her own consulting
            company, the freedom to work on innovative projects led her to
            founding a new technology company and to finally start to get some
            books out of her head and onto paper.&nbsp;
