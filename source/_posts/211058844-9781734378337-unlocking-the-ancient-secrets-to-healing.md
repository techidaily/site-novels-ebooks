            GAIL LYNN was first exposed to sound and light healing while working
            in the film industry as an executive producer for a movie about
            Elvis Presley called Protecting the King. When Gail's doctor
            diagnosed her with severe cardiovascular stress at the young age of
            37, caused by an accumulation of stress from two challenging
            relationships and three successive and extremely competitive careers
            in the automotive and telecommunications industries, and then as a
            Hollywood producer, she knew that she had to find a radical solution
            to her health issues. Extensive research led her into the world of
            frequency
          </p>
          <p>medicine and light and sound technologies.</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            After just a weekend of sessions with a non-invasive sound and light
            chamber, her Heart Rate
          </p>
          <p>
            Variability medical test showed the stress on her heart had
            significantly decreased. Unable to believe it could have been that
            easy, she continued sessions periodically for three years, during
            which a lifelong condition of
          </p>
          <p>
            chronic asthma disappeared, along with severe migraines that had
            been plaguing her for 23 years.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Determined to help others and open her own healing Center in Denver,
            Colorado, Gail simultaneously set out to uncover the ancient history
            and the modern science behind light and sound as healing therapies.
            Following
          </p>
          <p>
            a series of extraordinary synchronicities, which guided her to
            combine light and sound technologies with sacred geometry and Tesla
            mathematics, she developed a revolutionary immersive, resonance
            healing chamber called the Harmonic Egg, which is advancing
            frequency healing to an unimagined level. To find out more visit:

          "My experience in the Egg was extraordinary. I felt happy in my heart
          as soon as I saw it, but then the experience of being in it and taking
          the healing journey it offers was profound. I didn't want to speak
          afterward and needed

        <p>
          20 minutes or so to feel ready to leave the building and engage with
          the outside world. I felt peaceful, rearranged and reconnected. Gail
          Lynn is a beautiful soul who has created a brilliant device for the
          world-and I am

          researching the effectsof sacred geometry on our physical, emotional,
          and spiritual bodies. Just seeing the geometric shape, before even
          entering the Harmonic Egg, I could

          immediately feel the uplifting energy in the room. I also perceived
