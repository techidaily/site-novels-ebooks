          Reveals the long-forgotten prequel to the Grail mythos and how it has
          profound resonance with modern times <br /><br />• Includes the
          complete text of the Grail prequel,
          <i>The Elucidation of the Grail</i>, a 13th-century poem newly
          translated by Gareth Knight and Caitlín Matthews <br /><br />•
          Examines the forgotten story of the Faery Wars and the role of Well
          Maidens in the Grail story <br /><br />• Discusses the Seven Guardians
          of the Stories, the Grail Kings and Anti-Grail Kings, the Rich
          Company, the Courts of Joy, and the otherworldly Land of Women
          <br /><br />Unveiling the long-forgotten prequel to the Grail quest
          stories, Caitlín and John Matthews examine
          <i>The Elucidation of the Grail</i>, a forgotten 13th-century French
          text, and show how it offers the key to understanding the sevenfold
          path of the Grail and the deeper stories beneath the Christian Grail
          narrative. <br /><br />Beginning with a new translation of
          <i>The Elucidation</i> by foremost esotericist Gareth Knight and
          Caitlín Matthews, the authors provide a complete commentary on the
          poem, revealing a startling alternative cause of the Wasteland and the
          Grail quest, one which has a profound resonance with our own times.
          They examine the forgotten story of the Faery Wars and explain the
          Faery Accord, an agreement that once existed between humans and the
          Faery and upon which the spiritual and physical health of the land
          depends. The offering of the Grail and its regenerative powers by the
          Maidens of the Wells--Faery women--was part of this Accord. King
          Amangons and his men violated the Accord, through their abuse of the
          Well Maidens and other evil actions, causing the wasting of the land.
          The Knights of King Arthur seek to avenge the Well Maidens and rebirth
          the Grail to restore access to the lost paradisiacal “Courts of Joy”
          held in ancestral memory. On their quest, they encounter the Rich
          Company whose greed keeps the Knights occupied in long wars of
          attrition, yet their quest to restore the generous hospitality of the
          Wells--the true Grail, the Faery Grail--continues. <br /><br />In
          addition to the Faery Accord and Knights’ quest, the authors examine
          the Seven Guardians of the Stories, the Rich Fisher, the Courts of Joy
          and paradise lost, and the otherworldly Land of Women. They show how
          this lost book of the Grail reveals themes familiar to the modern
          world and offers hope of healing the rift between the worlds of Faery
          and human as well as restoration of our natural belonging to the land.

          “I share the Matthews’ view that <i>The Elucidation</i> draws in large
          part on authentic Celtic lore, as does the Grail legend. As Welsh
          scholar Sir John Rees suggested well over a century ago, the poem ‘has
          a very ancient ring.’ <i>The Lost Book of the Grail</i> not only
          illuminates but, I believe, rightly emphasizes the contemporary
          witness of the countryside being tragically subjected to relentless,
          irreparable destruction.”
