            There are physical and psychological experiences and rites of
            passage common to all women’s lives, crossing the boundaries of age,
            class, culture, race, sexual orientation, and religion. While women
            have a great hunger for ritual to reflect the events in their lives,
            they often do not know how to begin. For many, the very thought of
            creating their own rituals is too intimidating, and instead wait for
            others to take the lead, or simply suppress their own needs,
            desires, and dreams. Consequently, many women lead lives that too
            often are physically, emotionally, and spiritually unfulfilled.
            Finally, comes an author who seeks to provide women with the tools
            to address and fulfill their own needs for meaning that is sourced
            from their own intuitive knowing. Together, with open minds and
            hearts, we can learn to shape chaos and human needs into works of
            great power and beauty.

            Women’s Rites, Women’s Mysteries is a practical and magical,
            one-of-a-kind guide and resource for both creating and facilitating
            Goddess and female-centered rituals. Written for individuals and
            groups, both beginners and experienced ritualists alike, Dianic High
            Priestess and seasoned ritualist Ruth Barrett guides women through a
            unique step-by-step process, with practices that weaves personal
            need with an individual or group’s intuitive creativity. Barrett
            demystifies the components of how to design and facilitate an
            effective ritual for any significant occasion, seasonal holy day, or
            life-cycle event. Unique from other books on ritual, Barrett
            emphasizes energetics for ritual, delving into the awareness and
            conscious working of energy to intentionally align, support, and
            carry out the ritual’s purpose. From personal energetic preparation,
            preparation for group ritual facilitators and participants, Barrett
            provides practices and suggestions for this important and often
            overlooked aspect of the ritual experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Women’s Rites, Women’s Mysteries is specifically not a didactic
            ritual “cookbook,” that tells the reader exactly what to do, but
            rarely explains the reason or motivation behind a given enactment or
            symbol. Ruth Barrett teaches women how to think like a ritualist and
            develop the inner tools needed to create meaningful rituals for
            themselves and with others.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beginning with a discussion on the power of women’s ritual and the
            importance of women creating their own ritual experiences, Barrett
            proceeds with how to use intuition to develop a ritual’s purpose,
            how to work with energy that supports the ritual theme, creating
            enactments, appropriate structure, creating invocations, and an
            overview of a female-centered Wheel of the Year for seasonal
            celebrations. Barrett brings four decades of experience providing
            ritual facilitation, to discuss the personal and practical skills
            needed when creating, preparing for, and facilitating small or large
            group rituals that open to the public – a must for women drawn to
            providing rituals for others. Rarely addressed in print before is
            the topic of how to evaluate a ritual in order to constantly learn
            and improve them. A variety of magical techniques with applications
            for ritual and spellcraft are woven throughout the book that enhance
            and deepen a woman’s relationship with herself and the powers of
            nature. Barrett substantially discusses her perspective on the roles
            and responsibilities of the Priestess in ancient and contemporary
            times, the herstory and cosmology of the feminist Dianic tradition,
            its foundational spiritual tenants based on female embodiment,
            spiritual service, and as a spiritual feminist tool for women to
            heal from internalized patriarchal oppression.

          Women’s Rites, Women’s Mysteries is a well-written, thoughtful, and
          useful book that can help women with important passages in our lives,
          as well as with everyday life. The book is well grounded in research
          and analysis. Ruth Barrett provides a level of insight seldom found in
          books of this genre.

          Ruth Barrett brings her many years of experience in teaching and
          priestessing in the Dianic tradition to this book. Her thoughtfulness,
          intelligence, and depth of understanding make it a valuable resource
          and will open a new perspective for many Pagans.

          Ruth Barrett has given us the missing link between a good and the
          great ritual. Millions of women are interested in goddess worship
          today, in personal or communal activities. There are many books to
          learn from, but Ruth Barrett has given us the depth and reasons why.
          She reframes the knowledge once again for the new generation, as we
          must for webbing the Goddess back into herstory. Ruth has thoughtfully
          deepened and filled the rest of the Dianic sacred script.

          Ruth Barrett’s wise words open the door to a greater connection with
          spirit through ritual. This book will be of aid and interest to any
          woman who wishes to deepen her understanding of this aspect of the
          spiritual search.

          Even though this book was written for women, its lessons can be
          applied in any ritual context. Ruth Barrett challenges the reader to
          think about the process of creating rituals. This is no “cookbook.”
          Ruth covers many angles that are missing in previous books on ritual
          and fills in important details that other authors leave out.
          Definitely the best book on creating rituals that I have read.

          Ruth is a great priestess. It is wonderful to have some of her vast
          experience captured on pages at last. With this book she has brought
          the Dianic tradition forward, clarified its Goddess-centered premise,
          developed its thealogy, and provided strong material for ritual
          building. Women will use this book and the world will change. Most
          importantly, she has emphasized sisterhood and shared power; the soul
          of our movement.
