          a witch for formulating so clearly what has been known to every
          genuine spiritual tradition but kept forbidden and occult by draconian
          forces throughout the ages. Today, she instead joyfully burns the
          flame of erotic enlightenment so that we can literally unite with
          ourselves, with others, and with the deeper layers of our psyches as
          well as our bodies. This book is an impressive contribution to the

          groundbreaking resource for sexual embodiment, healing, release, and

          Herstik’s writing is passionate, inclusive, and embodied. Building on
          years of experience and drawing from the wellspring of Western
          esotericism, Herstik guides her reader towards a personal practice in
          a way that is both sensitive and encouraging of experimentation.
          <i>Sacred Sex</i> is a beautifully sincere and accessible guide to
          exploring erotic embodiment and sexual magic in a consensual,
          risk-aware, and (not least!) pleasure-affirming way."—<b

          >"Herstik crafts a velvety landscape that is highly evocative, yet
          reassuringly grounded. Approaching erotica with profound reverence,
          Herstik invites readers to reimagine their relationship with sex and
          sexuality, constructing their own&nbsp;devotional temples built on
          empowerment, self-actualization, and physical embodiment.&nbsp;Whether
          you're just beginning your spiritual quest or are a seasoned sensual
          mystic, <i>Sacred Sex</i> is an absolute must-read."—<b>Aliza Kelly</b
