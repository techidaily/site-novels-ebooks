          Anja Steensig of Denmark was living what seemed like a life of
          happiness, beauty, and television fame, yet inside she was living a
          life of darkness and hopelessness. Her every step felt as though she
          was stumbling through life without direction until she finally
          collapsed and surrendered. "It was not until I was broken and stripped
          of every possible defense," she writes, " . . . that I found the
          courage to be vulnerable enough to truly open the gates of my heart."
          This is where Book of Solace begins. It was within the source in her
          heart, where Anja began to rebuild her life from the sole perspective
          of Love.
          <p></p>
          No religion is needed, no guru, no church. The source is within each
          person, always ready to be received. With Anja's compassionate voice,
          the Book of Solace gently leads those who are disheartened back to
          their source, giving them a new opportunity to find, rebuild, and live
          a truly beautiful and joyful life.
          <p></p>

              >“I am here to remind you that within your heart is a place of
              sanctuary. A sacred place where you can find shelter, where you
              are unbreakable, the realm of unconditional Love . . . This is why
              I am writing to you today. As I step aside to allow the voice of
              Love to speak through me, I will provide a space where you can
              rest for a while. A space of solace and hope dedicated to
              reminding you of the eternal light you carry within.”</b
