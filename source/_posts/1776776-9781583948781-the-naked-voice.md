          Both science and spirituality agree that every particle of matter,
          every phenomenon we experience, is a form of resonance or vibration.
          The human voice is quite literally a mouthpiece of this truth; there
          is no form of expression more personal, more tied to our identities,
          than our voices. With simple inspirational exercises, this book by
          renowned voice teacher Chloe Goodchild gives readers the tools to
          guide them in a process of sound healing and soul communication that
          is guaranteed to open the heart and restore forgiveness, compassion,
          and interconnectedness between individuals and in their
          communities.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the heart of every human journey
          exists the longing to feel at home in one's self and in the world. In
          a unique response to meet this longing, Chloe Goodchild invites you on
          a compelling adventure of self-discovery and creative fulfillment
          through a direct experience of your own authentic voice--the voice of
          your personal authority, the song of your soul. Going beyond
          traditional vocal training guides, this book will appeal to anyone
          wishing to encounter themselves at a primal level through the medium
          of the voice.

          “Chloë’s subtle voice work opens the heart. She is a spectacular
          genius of this teaching art. She is at the core of a fascinating
          phenomenon that is allowing individuals to find their truth and
          freedom through the creative process of voice and sound.”<br />
          —<b>Coleman Barks</b>, author of <i>Rumi: Soul Fury</i><br />
          “Chloë has perfected a unique and empowering vocal technique
          accessible to everyone. In all my research with nonviolent and
          creative communication skills, I have never experienced this ability
          to effortlessly generate such a range and depth of human feeling and
          expression with such spontaneity, courage, and compassion. Chloë is
          dedicated to recovering the wisdom of the human spirit, in a way that
          is profound and unique for our times.”<br />
          —<b>Scilla Elworthy</b>, PhD, Niwano Peace Prize Winner and Nobel
          Peace Prize nominee, author of <i>Pioneering the Possible</i><br />
          “Chloë Goodchild has a voice of mesmerizing purity. She possesses one
          of the freest spirits I have seen on stage.”<br />
          —<b>Juliet Stevenson</b>, actor<br />
          “Chloë Goodchild’s teaching has opened up my true voice for
          theatre.”<br />
          —<b>Jerry Hall</b>, actor and model<br />“Chloë Goodchild has written
          a book that is a major contribution to our understanding of the power
          of sound and music. From her personal experiences as a singer to the
          many decades she has worked to empower people through their voices,
          she has discovered the deep truths inherent in coming into our true,
          authentic voice and nurturing our souls. This book is a must-read for
          sound healers, music therapists, physicians, and therapists. It is an
          astonishing accomplishment.”<br />
          —<b>Barbara J. Crowe</b>, board-certified music therapist, Arizona
          State University director of music therapy, and author of Music and
          Soulmaking: Toward a New Theory of Music Therapy<br />“Chloë’s work is
          joyful and a source of liberation. Singing with Chloë is a way of
          returning to original mind. She shows us how to find our authentic
          voice. It is the voice we need to sing out from and save this
          dazzlingly beautiful world.”<br />
          —<b>China Galland</b>, author of <i>The Bond between Women</i> and
          <i>Love Cemetery</i><br />
          “Chloë Goodchild’s clarity of tone—both in her music and in her
          book—penetrates to the bone. I revel in both her songs and words,
          especially when she surrenders to the mystery of devotion. In the West
          we usually shy away from pure devotion, often for legitimate reasons.
          But Chloë evokes the open, trembling, courageous heart of devotion
          that more deeply invites us into the danger of living. I celebrate and
          recommend her work.”<br />
          —<b>Gangaji</b>, spiritual teacher and author of Hidden Treasure:
          Uncovering the Truth in Your Life Story<br />
          “Chloë Goodchild’s music is a new force for peace.”<br />
          —<b>Ben Okri</b>, author of The Famished Road<br />
          “Out of nowhere, Chloë Goodchild’s naked voice, soaring with a range
          that one would have believed impossible.”<br />
          —<b><i>The Times Literary Supplement</i></b
          ><br />
          “Chloë looks like a nun, but she sings wild!”<br />
          —<b>Angelo Badalamenti</b>, film composer<br />
          “For many years now, through a time in which the sound of the soul has
          been largely muted by the din of the world, Chloë Goodchild’s
          characteristic optimism and joy have encouraged it to raise its voice
          in song. Her work has touched and opened many lives, and the light and
          beauty of her truly liberating spirit shine throughout the pages of
          this book.”<br />
          —<b>Lindsay Clark</b>, author of <i>The Chymical Wedding</i> and
          <i>The Water Theatre</i><br />
          “Chloë Goodchild is one of the foremost proponents of the voice as a
          therapeutic instrument for healing spirit, mind and body. In The Naked
          Voice she shows herself to be an inspirational teacher who projects
          her commitment and enthusiasm to opening up hearts and minds through
          the vibration of our voice. She captures the readers’ imagination,
          showing us that there is no one who cannot open up their voices to
          transform their lives. The Naked Voice will stand alongside those
          books that have become classics in the field of voice education and
          sound healing such as the late Don Campbell (The Mozart Effect and
          Healing at the Speed of Sound) who would be singing its praises.”<br />
          —<b>James D’Angelo</b>, PhD, founder of therapeutic vocal sound
          program Soundspirit and the author of<i>
            The Healing Power of the Human Voice</i
          ><br />
          “[A]n exciting book, exploring dimensions and connections little known
          to most of us … Based on her many years of singing and teaching
          experience and the stories of her own life, Chloë Goodchild writes
          with much passion about the foundational power of the human voice, the
          development of self-awareness through sound-awareness, the discoveries
          to be made and the wisdom to be gained by an in-depth encounter with
          the music within us and the music of life. An unusual approach of
          great originality that empowers you to think and act differently. It
          makes your heart sing and your body connect in surprisingly new
          ways.”<br />—<b>Ursula King</b>, professor emerita of theology and
          religious studies, Bristol University, UK, and author of
          <i>The Search for Spirituality</i><br />
          “Chloë Goodchild lives and breathes song. Her lifework, articulated in
          her inspirational and practical book, The Naked Voice: Transform Your
          Life through the Power of Sound, is a gentle, disarming and convincing
          call to all souls ready to return to the authentic power and beauty of
          their natural voice.”<br />
          —<b>Michael Stillwater</b>, founder of Inner Harmony and Song Without
          Borders<br />
          “The Naked Voice book radiates the power of hope and love from each
          page. Chloë Goodchild transforms the world into a brighter place. Her
          sheer positivity interweaves a truly practical guide where you will
          learn to express yourself in ways you never dreamed of. On a personal
          note, working with Chloë and her amazing voice was magical. She
          transformed my simple notes into something magnificent and wild and
          heart-rendingly beautiful. No other singer has ever matched her
          performance for me and I am so pleased to be able to say this in
          print!”<br />
          —<b>Elizabeth Parker</b>, film and television&nbsp;composer, former
          member of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop<br />
          “Chloë’s voice is primordial. She is a paradisal singer and teacher
          whose pure being ignites a sound from the source of creation, graced
          with love.…”<br />
          —<b>Greg Tricker</b>, mystic sculptor, visual artist, and author<br />
          “The simple purity of Chloë's recurring melody line sparks a whole
          series of core emotions too long buried.”<br />
          —<b>Lord David Puttnam</b><br />
          “Chloë, you are the voice of creation!”<br />
          —<b>James O’Dea</b>, author of <i>Cultivating Peace<br /></i> “In
          <i>The Naked Voice</i>, Chloë Goodchild invites us on a journey of
          self discovery through the power of experiencing our own authentic
          voice. This, she tells us, is the DNA of our true identity and, in
          this lyrical yet practical book, she invites us to discover, perhaps
          for the first time, our original song of the soul. As a voice teacher
          and performer, Chloë has transformed thousands of lives around the
          world with the potency of sound and song and here, in the written
          word, the wisdom of her teachings resonate through every page. Her
          words provide a map—a songline—directly into the compassionate heart
          that lies beneath rational thought to reveal who we really are,
          literally attuning us to our own inner peace, passion, and the divine
          bliss that is our birthright. Each chapter effortlessly weaves
          together inspirational stories of healing and transcendence, ancient
          spiritual knowledge and cutting edge science with practical exercises
          and vocal practices, to give us a treasured companion on the road to
          awakening.”<br />
          —<b>Nicola Graydon</b>, journalist and author of
          <i>The Ancestral Continuum</i><br />
          “I was the girl who was told to ‘just mouth the words’ in sixth-grade
          choir and was afraid to sing for decades thence. Chloë Goodchild
          reconsecrated my voice, tenderly and fiercely drawing it forth until I
          knew in my cells that my singing was not only a matter of my own
          healing and pleasure, but a profound invocation into a
          multidimensional singing field that has the power to serve not only my
          own awakening, but that of the planet as a whole. Now Chloë has done
          the miraculous: she has written her unique transmission into the pages
          of this book. Read it and hear the original, awake, alive and utterly
          unique naked voice sing free within you. It will heal your body, open
          your mind, and transform all your relationships.”<br />
          —<b>Kim Rosen</b>, author of
          <i>Saved by a Poem: The Transformative Power of Words<br /></i>“Even
          the most solid of material objects is ultimately a dance of constantly
          changing energy patterns. Ultimately it is all rhythm, all music, the
          world is sound—Nada Brahma —as the classical Sanskrit philosophers put
          it. Chloe&nbsp;Goodchild's &nbsp;magnificent book gives us keys to
          this &nbsp;universe we contain within our own voices. If practiced,
          the reader &nbsp;will know an inner and outer transformation that is
          both miraculous and true.”<br />
          —<b>Jean Houston</b>, PhD, author of

        </h4>
        <p>
          Over the past 30 years CHLOË GOODCHILD has established a worldwide
          platform as a voice pioneer, sound visionary, international
          singer-performer, and recording artist. Her global brand The Naked
          Voice and its charitable foundation have reached thousands of people
          with their radical approach to the transformative impact of sound.
          Deafness in childhood catalysed Chloë's lifetime's experiential
          research of the voice as one of humanity's most untapped resources for
          personal and global evolution and transformation. From the late 70s
          Chloë Goodchild evolved her own East-West vocal research, influenced
          by travels through Africa, India, Turkey, Europe, the U.S., and
          Canada. Goodchild's encounters with indigenous wisdom teachers and
          spiritual and classical Indian music masters ultimately gave birth to
          the unique method of sound and voice that Chloë eventually named The
          Naked Voice in 1990. Chloë has sung for world leaders and at peace
          conferences around the world. She was music director and composer for
          the 2001 V-Day performance of&nbsp;<i>The</i>&nbsp;<i
            >Vagina Monologues</i
          >&nbsp;with acclaimed playwright Eve Ensler in Madison Square Gardens.
          Chloë sang there and conducted the Vulva Choir of 75 influential
          women, including Queen Latifah, Jane Fonda, Brooke Shields, and Glenn
          Close. Chloë has made a range of solo and compilation albums,
          notably&nbsp;<i>Devi</i>, Grammy
          Award-nominated&nbsp;<i>Sura</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fierce Wisdom</i>,
          and&nbsp;<i>Thousand Ways of Light</i>. She and Rumi interpreter
          Coleman Barks recorded two Rumi albums,<i
            >There Is Some Kiss We Want</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Glance</i>. Chloë has collaborated and recorded
          with Angelo Badalamenti, John Tavener, and film director Jane Campion.
