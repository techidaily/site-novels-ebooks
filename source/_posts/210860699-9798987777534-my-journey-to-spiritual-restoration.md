            Gurmay had a rough start in life. At three months old, she was
            poisoned by her 12-year-old cousin. Burned and unable to swallow,
            she was in intensive care for several months, then discharged with a
            grim prognosis. But Gurmay survived, only to be raped at 4 years old
            for many months, violated as a teenager, experienced domestic
            violence, plus a variety of serious medical conditions-and the
            removal of a large and extremely rare tumor. With the help of God,
            the Author and Finisher of her faith, she was able to embrace the
            experiences that shaped her and began her spiritual restoration.
            Now, you experience your own journey to spiritual restoration, and
            receive the radiance of God's anointing in, on, and through your
            life. To God is all the glory for the great things He has done. Ms.
            Fraser is a licensed school social worker, a psychotherapist for
            over twenty-five years, a special educator, a certified speaker, a
            certified life coach, and a health and wellness coach. Ms. Fraser
            received the Award for Designing the Creative Work Environment.
