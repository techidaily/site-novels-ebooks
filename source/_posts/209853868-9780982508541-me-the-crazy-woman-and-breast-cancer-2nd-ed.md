            Award-winning authors, cancer patients, survivors and medical
            professionals, are all singing the praises of Me, the Crazy Woman
            and Breast Cancer and Stacy Shelton.
          </p>
          <p>
            Named Oklahoma's Best Author for her book Me, the Crazy Woman, and
            Breast Cancer, multi-award-winning former broadcast and print
            journalist Stacy Shelton, chronicles not one, but two diagnoses of
            breast cancer. Once diagnosed, Shelton found a new presence, which
            she dubbed "Crazy Woman," had taken up residence in her brain,
            wreaking havoc and forcing her to face her own mortality. As she
            learned to navigate the once foreign world of cancer, she realized
            that during the subsequent seven surgeries, including a bilateral
            mastectomy, several of her medical issues were falling through the
            cracks, leaving her even more vulnerable than she already was. Using
            her talents as a writer, she took the opportunity to bring to life
            this heroic, poignant, and enlightening work, to help others going
            through any life-altering journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Me, the Crazy Woman, and Breast Cancer, provides a roadmap to an
            almost impossible journey, and gives the patient, survivor, family
            member, and loved one, a window into the psyche of someone facing a
            life-threating illness. It is a timeless, and hauntingly moving
            memoir that will leave you knowing all of life's lessons are to be
            cherished.
