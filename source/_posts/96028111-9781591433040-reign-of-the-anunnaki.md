          Reveals the ongoing alien manipulation of humanity and how we can
          break free <br /><br />• Explores how the Anunnaki have maintained
          invisible surveillance over us and how they control our development
          through religion, secret societies, and catastrophes <br /><br />•
          Reveals how they feed off our energies and how this ability has
          allowed them to remain here on Earth as multidimensional entities,
          enforcing their control invisibly <br /><br />• Explains how they
          established religion to control us and how Gnostic Christianity--which
          came from Christ and not the Anunnaki--offers a way out of their
          matrix of control <br /><br />Cuneiform texts found on clay plates in
          Mesopotamia tell us about an extraterrestrial race, called the
          Anunnaki, who came from space to exploit our planet. Through genetic
          manipulation, they created modern humans from existing earthly life
          forms to serve them as slaves. They physically left our planet
          millennia ago, but as Jan Erik Sigdell reveals, their influence and
          control over humanity is still pervasive and significant.
          <br /><br />Sigdell explains how the Anunnaki have maintained
          invisible surveillance over us as well as control over how humanity
          develops, setting limits on our evolution and holding back our
          development by means of manipulation and catastrophes, including the
          deluge immortalized in the Bible and many other ancient myths. He
          shows how they still manipulate our politics and affairs via secret
          societies, such as the Illuminati, and the political elite, such as
          the Bilderberg Group. Examining ancient descriptions of the Anunnaki
          as entities that resemble winged reptiles or amphibians, the author
          also explores their diet and how they feed off blood and the energies
          given off by lower life forms, such as humans, when they are
          expressing extreme negative emotions, having sex, or dying. This
          energy-feeding ability has allowed them to remain here on Earth as
          multidimensional entities, enforcing their control invisibly. He
          explains how the Anunnaki established religions as tools for control,
          setting up the major religions with themselves as “gods” and playing
          them against each other to keep humanity’s attention away from ongoing
          Anunnaki manipulation. They have also hidden from us the existence of
          the true highest creator, who created the cosmos as well as the
          Anunnaki themselves. <br /><br />The author reveals how the highest
          creator sent a messenger called Jesus to expose the Anunnaki and show
          us a way out of their matrix of control through a spirituality based
          on love, empathy, and sacred sexuality. But the “god” of the Anunnaki
          defeated this messenger and replaced him with a false Christ. This led
          to the development of Paulinian Christianity under Anunnaki influence,
          as well as other parallel religions such as Islam, and the suppression
          and elimination of the original Christianity, Gnostic Christianity.
          With the discovery of hidden Gnostic texts and teachings at Nag
          Hammadi in 1945, the way is now paved for our release from the reign
          of the Anunnaki.
