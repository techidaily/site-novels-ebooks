            79My story begins, where else, but at the beginning when prayer
            became the essential foundation of a young Prayer Warrior Princess's
            life. The Prayer Warrior Princess's life elevated her into the
            presence of God through faith, and more prayer. She was privileged
            to have the Father explain deep truths about her identity as a child
            of the King of Kings.Growing up on a farm in the late 1950s, the
            author was surrounded by many family members, including her siblings
            and her parents. From birth, her parents believed there was a
            special significance about her life. It seemed to be anointed and
            gifted in a manner reminiscent of the young boy, King David. Both of
            her parents recognized and nurtured her anointing, but it was her
            father who motivated her the most. He would give her encouragement
            that she was one God was using and would use for a noteworthy
            purpose. Although he could not tell her how or when it would happen,
            they both knew that God would reveal his purpose for her life at a
            Kairos moment—just the right time.The Prayer Warrior Princess and
            her father saw evidence of how her faith in God's Word activated,
            advocated and called her to action as she spoke to others, causing
            their faith in God to increase. There would be many spiritual
            witnesses to the miraculous signs and wonders that followed her from
            birth throughout her childhood.The purpose of this book is to tell
            the story of how God came to the young Prayer Princess and
            transformed her way of thinking. Without faith in God, and prayer,
            she would not have made it to where she is today. Prayerfully, it is
            my deepest wish that millions will read this book and draw much joy
            and insight from it. This book was written, not only as a testament
            of my prayer journey, but also as an inspiration to other faithful
            and gifted prayer warriors. I encourage you to continue to pray
            without ceasing (1 Thess. 5:16–18).
