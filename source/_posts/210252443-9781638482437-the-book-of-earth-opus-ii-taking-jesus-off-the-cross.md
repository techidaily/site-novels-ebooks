              A book to share with all so we can all learn to see instead of
              being blinded by the matrix we are forced to accept at birth. A
              matrix enforced every step we take. A matrix that teaches us do
              not question the imperial rules and resulting order. If you do you
              too will be put on the cross.&nbsp;</span

              references to music culture, arrives December 9th. In the book,
              Machat expunges the accepted concepts of religion and asks: Why
              are we slaves to the few? Who are they? Why do we acquiesce to
              this systematic humiliation? And for that matter: Who are we? Why
              are we here? How did we get here?</span
