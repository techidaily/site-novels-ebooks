            >Integrating numerology, astrology, Kabbalah, and the contemplative
            life</b
          ><br /><br />• Connects the traditional, symbolic, psychological,
          alchemical, astrological, and numerological meanings of each of the 78
          cards of the Tarot to its deepest meaning, the one closest to its
          spiritual core<br /><br />• Reveals how the Tarot offers a hands-on
          way to learn multiple spiritual practices and metaphysical systems,
          including numerology, astrology, psychology, and Kabbalistic wisdom<br /><br />•
          Details how to use the Tarot to calculate the numerological value of
          names, words, and dates, including birthdays, to reveal their
          metaphysical significance<br /><br />As John Sandbach illuminates in
          depth, the tarot is a portal to realms of wisdom. It not only can
          provide deep insight through traditional readings but also offers a
          hands-on way to learn multiple spiritual practices and metaphysical
          systems, each interrelated through numbers and the ways the systems
          are worked with to reveal cosmic truths.<br /><br />In this guide,
          Sandbach explores the deep interconnected meanings of each of the 78
          cards of the tarot and explains how to work with the cards for
          spiritual healing and growth as well as to synergistically learn other
          methods of spiritual insight, in particular numerology and astrology.
          Connecting the traditional, symbolic, psychological, alchemical,
          astrological, and numerological meanings of each card to its deepest
          meaning, the one closest to its spiritual core, Sandbach shows how
          exploring the interconnected meanings of the cards allows you to
          understand the tarot as an integrated whole and enables you to provide
          insightful and deeply intuitive readings. He explains how every card
          is connected to the Tree of Life, an ancient kabbalistic diagram of
          the universe, and details how to use the tarot to calculate the
          numerological value of names, words, and dates to reveal their
          metaphysical significance. He explores the connections between
          alternative rulerships for the cards and how they allow you to
          understand astrology at a deeper level. He also demonstrates card
          layouts that can be used to perform readings for yourself or others,
          and he provides instructions for tarot contemplations to access deeper
          meanings of the cards.<br /><br />By journeying through the wisdom
          connections within each card, you can simultaneously learn the ancient
          wisdom of numerology and astrology, while also opening access to your
          own inner wisdom.

          “What Joseph Campbell constructed for mythology, John Sandbach
          composes for the metaphysical: a harmonic illumination of the astral
          orchestra. More than a mere reference book, John provides a poetic key
          to a profound exploration of esoteric mechanisms. This book is a
          voyage into the subconscious cocoon, where an evolution of conceptual
          traditions emerges, bright and wonderful.”
