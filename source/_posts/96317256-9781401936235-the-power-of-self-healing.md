          Most of us are no strangers to health problems, illness, or pain, but
          what if there's a solution to restore our well-being that doesn't
          involve drugs, surgery, or other medical procedures? Well, there is,
          and you'll find it within your own body. That's right! Your body has a
          built-in capacity to heal itself-a remarkable system of self-repair
          that works day in and day out-and improving its ability to heal is
          within your control. Yet most people don't fully grasp the body's
          incredible power to heal itself, largely because traditional medicine
          has led us to believe that health comes from the outside in and not
          from the inside out. Did you know, for example, that approximately 50
          percent of all illnesses, when left alone, will eventually heal
          themselves? If you choose to take care of your body every day, it will
          reward you a thousand times over-improving your odds against
          everything from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes; to arthritis,
          allergies, colds, late-winter flu, and more. Remember, you have the
          power to be and stay healthy because healing truly comes from within.
          The Power of Self-Healing will help you accomplish all this and more!
