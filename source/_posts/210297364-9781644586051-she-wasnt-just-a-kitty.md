          <p>
            In July of 2016, I was called to go to Virginia as my brother was
            very sick and was needed to there with him. My wife was to remain
            home and take care of things here. After about a week, my brother
            was improving, so I decided to return home.On the return trip, I got
            a call from my wife, and she began telling me about a small black
            kitten that had appeared on our patio one morning. The kitten was
            very small and looked very weak and frail like someone had abandoned
            it. The wife decided for the time to feed the kitten to make sure
            nothing happened to it. This went on for about a week, feeding and
            caring for the kitten.When the wife shared with her friend how she
            was feeding the kitten and caring for her, her friend said this
            kitten is now yours. So by giving her all this attention, the kitty
            was to grow and stay day after day becoming a big part of her life.
            The strangest part about all of this was that she was allergic to
            cats and could not be around them.My wife and I had often talked if
            we were to get a pet it would be a dog. But God had a way of taking
            care of our needs and not our wants. There were things over the
            years in our life that needed to be healed: my wife's allergies, our
            marriage, and growing together. My ability to be open and feel
            emotion as I should. There was something that happened as a child
            that stole my self-worth and being able to feel the ability to cry
            when sadness happened. This little creation of God had come into our
            lives to change all of that. When we first took her with us, we just
            called her Kitty.After six months, we wanted to take Kitty to the
            vet, and we did not know if she was a male or female. Once we
            discovered her gender, we decided to name her Miss Kitty. From that
            day on, she took over our home and our lives. Miss Kitty would do
            things that would keep us spellbound, and seeing her romping through
            our home gave us such peace. My wife no longer had problems with
            allergies. We found ourselves sitting together watching her, and it
            brought conversation and to be more open to each other.After a year
            and half, Miss Kitty got out and strayed to our neighbor's yard.
            They have two large dogs. This was very unusual because she never
            went near that side of the fence or entered their yard. The dogs got
            her, and the damage was fatal.After getting her to the vet, we were
            told that we had lost her because of severe damage to her skin being
            pulled from her body. As I said earlier, I hadn't felt any emotion
            like this in a long time. This broke me as something that I had
            never felt before. Tears were flowing, and I just couldn't talk for
            the flow of emotion. This was my healing from God. It was very
            painful losing Miss Kitty, but we can see this was our lives being
            mended and repaired for future use in God's work.
