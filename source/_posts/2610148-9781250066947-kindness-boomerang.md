          "We are powerful beyond measure when we are kind—when, through simple
          kind acts extended to others we help a fellow human feel better and
          they in turn pay it forward. No one knows this better than kindness
          guru Orly Wahba. Her inspiring daily guide
          <i>Kindness Boomerang</i> is the tool we all need to tap into our
          goodness, unlock our kindness, and unleash that kind self upon a
          suffering world."<br />-Julie Lythcott-Haims, author of the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller<i> How to Raise an Adult</i>
          <br /><br />“<i>Kindness Boomerang</i> is filled with fun tips and
          ideas for finding happiness in everyday activities.”<br />-Tony Hsieh,
          author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
          <i>Delivering Happiness</i> and CEO of Zappos.com, Inc.<br /><br />"<i
            >Kindness Boomerang</i
          >
          is a little book that will make a big change, a little bite-sized
          bible of reminders for those who want to stay on the path of
          compassion.”<br />-Amanda Palmer, author of the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Art of Asking</i
          ><br /><br />"Orly Wahba's book <i>Kindness Boomerang</i> is more than
          good philosophy, it is a box of spiritual tools - it is full of heart
          and decent thoughts, good will, and makes available a ready course of
          action for any given day. This is the work of a beautiful and evolved
          human being. When I grow up, I hope to be more like Orly Wahba. Get
          this book! Change the world a little bit at a time, and you yourself
          can change.”<br />
          -Peter Scolari<br /><br />"Orly Wahba has composed a modern day bible.
          These lessons of kindness are desperately needed by a world that has
          lost its way."<br />-David Horgan, author of
          <i>When Your Parent Moves In</i><br /><br />"Orly Wahba has produced a
          treasure trove of kindness. This little book can help change the world
          for the better, one person at a time. It's wonderful."<br />-Myron
          Kandel, CNN Founding Financial Editor<br /><br />"The world's greatest
          untapped resource? The kindness in each of us. And it's free! Imagine
          if we all practiced Orly's 365 daily acts of kindness. Everything
          would change."<br />-Nancy Lublin, founder of Crisis Text Line<br /><br />"<i
            >Kindness Boomerang</i
          >
          fills a gap in the literature, giving youth and adults the gift of
          renewed kindness every day. Orly Wahba shares her gift of living
          kindness with authenticity that helps all readers see how easy it is
          to truly make the world a better place. You can read it day by day, or
          you can imagine sitting with a friend and a cup of tea while reading
          and growing inspired; either way, you'll find kindness really is like
          a boomerang. It always comes back to you and that is beautiful."
          <br />-Dr. Lydia Criss Mays<br /><br />"Orly has written the
          definitive guide to life. Kindness is what it's ALL about."<br />-Dan
          Lythcott-Haims<br /><br />"If you’re looking for inspiration,
          motivation, or action, this book will 'kindly' get it done. Go ahead
          and open to today’s date. It will make your day, and maybe even change
          your life. You will quickly realize, there’s no one quite like
          Orly."<br />-Race Taylor, 95.5 WPLJ Radio NY host
