            If you don’t feel good about yourself, it can be difficult to reach
            your goals and live a happy, meaningful life. You may have already
            read countless books on building self-esteem, but after a while you
            end up right where you started—feeling like you just aren’t good
            enough. So, what are the real secrets to genuine, lasting
            self-esteem?
          </p>
          <p>
            Most books on self-esteem tell you that you should feel good about
            yourself, but they don’t show you how to put self-esteem into
            action. In this book, psychologist Marie Hartwell-Walker offers a
            groundbreaking new approach to self-esteem based in mindfulness and
            positive psychology. This book provides practical, step-by-step
            strategies and skills to help you develop feelings of competency,
            gain resiliency, rebuild self-confidence, and feel good by engaging
            in positive actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Self-confidence is more than just a way of being—it’s a way of
            doing! By taking steps to solve problems and overcome roadblocks by
            helping yourself (and others!), you will learn to practice
            self-confidence, rather than just think about it. If you’re ready to
            learn the secrets to genuine self-esteem, and put what you’ve
            learned into action, this book will show you how.

          “If you pick up a book on building self-esteem, you’d presumably like
          to feel better about yourself. Yet many of these guides simply cheer
          us on emptily, or provide us with anecdotes that just don’t fit. In
          <i>Unlocking the Secrets of Self-Esteem</i>, psychologist Marie
          Hartwell-Walker takes a different approach. … Walker doesn’t talk
          about cognitive techniques. She doesn’t tell us to talk back to our
          inner voice, and she doesn’t tell us to monitor our thoughts. What she
          does give us is a clear, effective guide, filled with tangible tools,
          all well-researched and user-friendly.”<br />
