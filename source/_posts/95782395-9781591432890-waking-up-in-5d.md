          Tools and teachings to guide you in the transition from the polarized
          mindset of the 3rd dimension to the joy and love of 5th dimensional
          vibrations <br /><br />• Explains how to recognize the 5D experiences
          you’ve already had, identify the differences between 3D linear
          thinking and 5D multidimensional thinking, and turn 3D viewpoints
          around to expand your perception of what is possible <br /><br />•
          Includes exercises to protect your energies, especially while
          sleeping, and Sacred Geometry meditations to open yourself to higher
          frequencies <br /><br />• Reveals how to develop a Higher Self
          connection, increase your sensitivity to dimensional signatures, and
          consciously choose 5D, where love is the governing force
          <br /><br />We are all transitioning from the narrowly-focused and
          polarized awareness of the Third Dimension and waking up to the higher
          vibrations and abilities of the Fifth Dimension. Each of us has
          already experienced 5D: Think about your most memorable and uplifting
          experiences of the recent past--where everything went well,
          interactions were harmonious and loving, and all felt blissful and
          happy--that’s 5D. For some, the shift is sudden and permanent, but for
          many of us, the change is gradual, coming in fleeting moments and
          waves. In this ascension manual, spiritual teacher Maureen J. St.
          Germain explains how to shift your energetic patterns and choose to
          permanently anchor yourself in the joy, love, and kindness of 5D.
          <br /><br />Guiding you through the opportunities the Fifth Dimension
          has to offer, the author reveals how to develop a Higher Self
          connection, increase your sensitivity to dimensional signatures, and
          consciously choose 5D, where love is the governing force. She shows
          how 5D relates to 3D as well as to 4D, the transitional dimension
          between the two, and explains how to read the energy patterns that
          distinguish one dimension from the next as well as how to experience
          multiple dimensions simultaneously. She explores how to identify the
          differences between “good vs. evil” polarized 3D linear thinking and
          dynamic 5D multidimensional thinking and how to turn 3D viewpoints
          around to expand your perception of what is possible.
          <br /><br />Offering eye-opening stories of 5D experiences from
          students and inspiring information from her spirit guides, the author
          also details exercises to protect your energies, especially while
          sleeping, and provides Sacred Geometry meditations to activate your
          8th chakra and open yourself to higher frequencies. She also explores
          how awakening to 5D allows you to form a strong bond to global
          consciousness, so your personal transformations will have a more
          profound impact on the people in your circle, and beyond.
