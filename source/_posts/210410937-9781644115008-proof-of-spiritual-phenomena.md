          • Shares data and meta-analysis from a large volume of extremely
          sophisticated experiments that provide proof for the existence of psi
          phenomena <br /><br />• Explores evidence of past lives, intuitive
          knowing, and other spiritual phenomena <br /><br />• Reveals the
          author’s own inexplicable experiences as well as her conversations
          with scientific colleagues, high-level experts, and government
          officials <br /><br />Fully indoctrinated into the cult of science,
          neuroscientist Mona Sobhani, Ph.D., aggressively defended the dogma of
          scientific beliefs--until a series of life-altering events caused her
          to reconsider spirituality and psi concepts and launched her into a
          two-year investigation into the ineffable mysteries of our world.
          <br /><br />Sharing the extensive research she discovered on past
          lives, karma, and the complex interactions of mind and matter, the
          author details her transformation from diehard materialist to
          open-minded spiritual seeker. She reveals her conversations about
          spirituality and anomalous occurrences with scientific colleagues as
          well as high-level experts and government officials who shared data on
          extremely sophisticated experiments that provided proof for the
          existence of psi phenomena. She discovered that psi research has been
          conducted on a grand scale for more than a century--by hundreds of
          scientists with hundreds of thousands of participants--and that there
          exists substantial evidence for the reality of psi. She examines
          meta-analysis of these experiments, such as that of the Ganzfield
          tests, which showed odds against chance of 12 billion to 1--throwing
          our current scientific materialist paradigm into question.
          <br /><br />Providing a deep dive into the literature of psychology,
          quantum physics, neuroscience, philosophy, and esoteric texts, Sobhani
          also explores the relationship between psi phenomena, the
          transcendence of space and time, and spirituality. Culminating with
          the author’s serious reckoning with one of the foundational principles
          of neuroscience--scientific materialism--this illuminating book shows
          that the mysteries of human experience go far beyond what the present
          scientific paradigm can comprehend.

          “With <i>Proof of Spiritual Phenomena</i>, you hold the key to
          unlocking a whole new level of experiencing and understanding, not
          only the world around you that you can see but also the one you can’t
          see. Backed up with easyto- understand science as well as mind-blowing
          evidence and interviews, Sobhani achieves what is, in my opinion, the
          first book to truly unlock the intersection point between science and
          soul-based spirituality. This book is so outstanding and
          life-changing, you will find yourself buying extra copies to give to
          everyone you love so that they, too, can experience the magic that is
          <i>Proof of Spiritual Phenomena</i>.”
