          "Mark Mincolla has put together a book of great value.”<br /><b
            >—Bernie Siegel, MD</b
          >
          author of <i>Faith, Hope &amp; Healing</i> and
          <i>A Book of Miracles</i><br /><br />"Thought-provoking and worthy of
          further investigation."<br /><b>—Publishers Weekly</b><br /><br />"In
          this compelling, ambitious book, natural health care practitioner Mark
          Mincolla proposes that all disease takes root at the energetic level,
          and by learning to identify the energy deficiencies and excesses that
          cause pain and sickness, we can enter a more vibrant state of being.
          In clear, precise language, Mincolla breaks down exactly how energy is
          transmitted through thoughts in the form of vibrations, and how these
          different frequencies have the power to hurt or heal.
          <b><i>Whole Health</i></b> spans epochs, weaving the healing
          properties of foods with the big bang theory, classical Chinese
          medicine, and our sixth sense. It's the perfect book for readers
          seeking to tie theories of energy and awareness to their daily
          practice, but beware: one must be ready for a mind-expanding paradigm
          shift."<br />—<b>Spirituality &amp; Health</b>
          magazine<br /><br />"Whole Health is loaded with many gems about
          health and wholeness. I highly recommend it/"<br /><b
            >—Christiane Northrup, M.D.</b
          ><br /><br />"This is a must-read for all those searching for ways to
          increase their ability to take control of their nutritional,
          emotional, and physical well-being."<br /><b>—Keith Ablow, M.D.</b
          ><br /><br />"Read this book and introduce yourself to the future of
          medicine, available to you right now."<br /><b
            >—Dana Ullman, coauthor of Everybody's Guide to Homeopathic
            Medicine</b
          ><br /><br />“[<i>Whole Health</i> is] a synthesized whole-body
          program essential for any interested in overall health and how
          different emotional, physical, and spiritual systems interact. Add in
          appendixes packed with natural treatments for specific conditions from
          fibroids to Parkinson's disease and charts for body assessments and
          food and you have an important treatment that integrates many
          different holistic approaches to health.”<br /><b
