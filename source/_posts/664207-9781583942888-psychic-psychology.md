            >Two of America's most experienced and respected psychic teachers
            present their system of the subtle energy of interpersonal
            relationships in a book that will appeal to anyone wishing to
            understand and improve their relationships within their families,
            partnerships, workplaces, and wider communities</b
          ><br /><br />This useful guide from two of America’s preeminent
          psychics is unique in its focus on individual psychology and
          interpersonal relationships. It begins with simple meditations during
          which practitioners learn how to recognize their own psychic
          energy—and also determine if that energy is constrained.
          <i>Psychic Psychology</i> shows how to free energy through such tools
          as grounding, clearing psychic enmeshment, and finding the space from
          which to respond most openly, resourcefully, and generously to life.
          An entire chapter is devoted to exploring the specific energies men
          and women have based on their biological differences and helping them
          to deal with their own energy and that of the other sex.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Friedlander and Hemsher present the everyday usefulness of clairvoyant
          skills within a big picture where they explain that we create our
          reality, but do not control it; and that the personality—like the
          soul—is eternal and always growing. The final section describes how
          psychic skills can be applied in real-world contexts, which are often
          ambiguous and contradictory. The book explores common issues such as
          dealing with selfdoubt without jumping to unwarranted, blind
          confidence and how to communicate effectively, with clear boundaries.

          “At the core of each of us are pathways into deeper, more profound,
          more gratifying ways of living than those cultivated by a culture that
          cherishes materialistic gain,&nbsp;instant gratification, and
          maintaining a competitive edge. <i>Psychic Psychology</i>&nbsp;gently
          and effectively teaches those who will take the time and exert the
          effort to enter hidden realms that have been known to&nbsp;wisdom
          traditions&nbsp;throughout time. Through ninety-eight practical and
          wonderfully accessible exercises, it systematically builds your
          connection with the&nbsp;psychic energies&nbsp;that surround you and
          brings you into the eternal moment, where our deepest joy and most
          authentic living dwell.”<br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          “John Friedlander&nbsp;and Gloria Hemsher give you a universe you can
          believe in, but more than <br />
          that: a universe that believes in you, a universe you always secretly
          knew was there.”<br />

          “<i>Psychic Psychology, </i>invitingly warm and clearly written, is a
          book that needs to be read, like one enjoys a box of very fine
          chocolates, slowly … enjoyed and savored, tasting each layer, one bite
          at a time. Chapters on advanced grounding techniques and other life
          skills continue to bring me and my students to a deeper place of
          understanding, balance, and strength within our hatha yoga and
          meditation practice. The practical skills taught in this book allow us
          to engage in the world and capably experience life as a spiritual
          journey.”<br />
          —Lilias Folan, “First Lady of Yoga,” PBS host of
          <i>Lilias! Yoga and You</i> and author of
          <i>Lilias! Yoga Gets better with Age</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Psychic Psychology</i> is an elegant synthesis of several great
          teaching traditions, combining the wisdom of the Seth material with
          the structural elements from Eastern and Western approaches to energy
          healing. You can skim this book, learn a lot and enjoy it thoroughly.
          But then to benefit from its depth and true power, I suggest treating
          it as a workbook to be experienced over the course of several months,
          serving as a catalyst for your personal transformation.<br />
          This book is a hands-on guide to the mechanics of the mysticism in
          everyday life; by describing the nuts and bolts of energy flow in
          relationships, both present and past, the book shows the reader how,
          literally, to create your own reality. Infused by the very attitudes
          that Hemsher and Friedlander advise the reader to adopt—openness,
          playfulness, and curiosity—the book is both challenging and
          entertaining, and is guaranteed to broaden any reader’s understanding
          of the nature of personal reality.”<br />
          —Eric Leskowitz, MD, author of <i>The Joy of Sox, </i>Director of the
          Integrative Medicine Project at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital,
          Boston MA, and faculty member of the Department of Psychiatry, Harvard
          Medical School<br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          “John and Gloria have elevated the work of psychic and spiritual
          development to entirely new levels. The skills and exercises are
          practical, insightful, and they leverage the best of all of us—our
          curiosity, imagination, and playfulness. All in the pursuit of
          self-awareness and healing. Female grounding is a worthy practice in
          and of itself—for all over-committed, harried, nurturing women
          everywhere. Read this book and learn to female ground!”<br />
          —Jill Leigh, founder and director of the Energy Healing Institute,
          Boston, MA<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “John Friedlander&nbsp;is the truth. There is the big picture,
          so-called, and then&nbsp;<i>another&nbsp;</i>big picture
          framing&nbsp;<i>it. </i>That one is not only invisible, operating at a
          different vibration from our perceived consciousness state, but
          flashes of its recognition change everything, put us back into a
          hospitable universe. The&nbsp;<i>big&nbsp;</i>big picture takes the
          darkest aspects of our crisis and despair, locates them rightly in a
          larger congruence, and makes us calm and whole. There is a great deal
          of work ahead, some hard yoga, but John provides a few of the key
          tools that we will need. This is a teaching ahead of its time by
          perhaps a thousand years, but it is completely imbued with our time
          because it is the background against which all our foregrounds curtsy
          and pay homage.”<br />

          “In this beautiful and very important book,&nbsp;John
          Friedlander&nbsp;and Gloria Hemsher share knowledge to expand your
          understanding of the cosmos and practical tools with which to improve
          your life. A fascinating and deeply insightful exploration of what it
          means to be a soul having a human experience. There is great wisdom
          here.”<br />
