          If you do magic, pray, or venerate your ancestors, you are working
          with spirits. If you seek information or guidance through channeling,
          through mediumship, or through the words and visions of mystics, you
          are also working with the beings of the subtle realms.
          <i>Spirit Speak</i> presents a unified system for understanding a
          broad range of nonphysical beings that we call spirits. Dominguez is
          able to make complex ideas accessible, through analogy and example,
          without oversimplifying. This comprehensive book can be understood and
          appreciated by readers from all different faiths, backgrounds, and
          levels of experience. It explores concepts such as: spiritual lineage,
          the assumption of god forms, divine embodiment, and the limits and
          potential for many spiritual practices. A hidden classic in many
          spiritual communities for years, <i>Spirit Speak</i> is now available
          with new material and fresh insights.
