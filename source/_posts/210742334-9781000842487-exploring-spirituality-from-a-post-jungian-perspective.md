            Derived from Ruth Williams’ more than 40-year immersion in spiritual
            practice, as well as her clinical experience as a Jungian analyst,
            this thought-provoking volume explores the nature of spiritual paths
            and trajectories in practical ways, incorporating personal anecdote
            and ground-breaking academic research and providing a window into
            how Jungian practitioners work with soul and spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Williams explores the nature of being a human using the Yiddish idea
            of a person being a ‘mensch’, which means being a decent human
            being, having humanity and living ethically with integrity. The idea
            of ‘grace’ is the thread that runs through the book—the mystery that
            binds things together and makes life meaningful, purposeful,
            potentially joyful and spiritually fulfilling. Williams sees ‘grace’
            as being that which underpins and lies behind synchronicity and
            divinatory practices and as a force by which we can learn to be
            guided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rooted in clinical work, Exploring Spirituality from a Post-Jungian
            Perspective is fascinating reading for Jungian analysts, therapists
            and academics, as well as for general readers interested in a
            spiritual journey, both personally and for clinical purposes.

            >Exploring Spirituality from a Post-Jungian Perspective: Clinical
            and Personal Reflections </i
          >a uniquely welcoming voice and distilled wisdom. Whatever our
          religious or secular background, this book invites us to celebrate
          being human by becoming spiritual. Williams writes with the
          accessibility and experiential depth to include everyone with a
          questing spirit, whether familiar with Jungian psychology or not.
          Superbly grounded in the personal, this book is a deep dive into
          dimensions of being often labelled religious, mystical, esoteric,
          paranormal, or transpersonal. It shows us how to live more fulfilled
          lives in this troubled twenty first century. Buy it!"

          "This important work captures the essence of a spiritual approach to
          the unconscious: continually grounding experience by reality testing,
          watching what your Shadow is doing, and having a sense of humour. Ruth
          explains this with clarity, vision and, above all, warmth of heart."

          "Ruth Williams has a feel for what matters, and in this set of
          engaging reflections on what spirituality means, or might mean, in the
          contemporary world, she homes in on a range of challenging but vital
          topics: ecological responsibility, the purpose of life, destiny, the
          ineffable, and many more. As a psychotherapist, Williams is far from
          unfamiliar with the darker side of life; but she also attends to the
          struggles involved in facing the light. Through a deft choice of
          anecdotes and vignettes drawn from spiritual traditions, popular
          culture, and above all her own personal and professional experience,
          she champions the pursuit of one’s individual path. And her vivid,
          personable style helps to make all the addressed issues emotionally as
          well as intellectually accessible. Exuding courage and generosity,
          this book should be helpful to a wide readership."

          "Williams brings her succinct, integrative style into her explorations
          of this boundless and vast topic which makes it an accessible and
          thought-provoking read… Williams does a masterful job of saying more
          with less which is particularly challenging for a topic as complex and
          ineffable as diverse perspectives on spirituality.”

          <i>"</i>This book skilfully weaves the personal and the clinical …
          facing both the light and the darkness of the shadow… The author is a
          sound guide through the dilemmas of life, knowing, conscience and
          integrity in the face of human finitude … Significantly, the final
          chapter is on grace, which Ruth sees as how the wise consciousness
          communicates with us if we have eyes to see and ears to hear – we need
          to be open, receptive and humble but also focused in intent and
          purpose. This searching book will be of particular interest to
          clinicians, but there is also much to glean for general readers."

          'Williams’s expansive definition of spirituality and the sheer number
          of profound questions and ideas touched on in the relatively short
          book results in a guidebook to modern spirituality that provokes
          readers to examine their own relationship to many facets of life.'
