          ><br /><br />Many of us respond to the pressures of life by turning
          inward and ignoring problems, sometimes resulting in anxiety or
          depression. Others react by working harder at the office, at school,
          or at home, hoping that this will make ourselves and the people we
          love happier. But what if being yourself is enough? Just as we are
          advised on airplanes to take our own oxygen first before helping
          others, we must first be at peace with ourselves before we can be at
          peace with the world around us.<br /><br />In this beautiful follow-up
          to his international bestseller
          <i>The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down,</i> Zen Buddhist
          monk Haemin Sunim turns his trademark wisdom to the art of self-care,
          arguing that only by accepting yourself--and the flaws that make you
          who you are--can you have compassionate and fulfilling relationships
          with your partner, your family, and your friends. With more than
          thirty-five full-color illustrations,
          <i>Love for Imperfect Things</i> will appeal to both your eyes and
          your heart, and help you learn to love yourself, your life, and
          everyone in it.<br /><br /><b

          “The struggle for self-compassion can be difficult for even the most
          enlightened among us. . . . As Haemin Sunim explains throughout his
          book, self-compassion does not mean being selfish. It’s only when we
          take care of ourselves, he explains, that we can care for others.” —<b
            ><i>The New York Times</i></b
          ><br /><br />“A real treasure. It teaches us that compassion is at the
          heart of healing . . . starting with ourselves. I highly recommend
          this book.” —<b
            >Christiane Northrup, MD, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
            author of <i>Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom</i></b

          news. This book hit me like a ton of bricks and made many anxieties
          melt away.” —<b

            <i>The Book of Awesome </i>and <i>The Happiness Equation</i></b
          ><br /><br />“You can be the most amazing human being in the world and
          everyone sees rays of light, love, and genius when they look at you,
          but if you yourself don’t know it, all of that external admiration
          doesn’t matter one bit. Haemin Sunim teaches you ways to love yourself
          first, instead of loving the idea of other people loving you. It makes
          a world of difference.” —<b

          <i>The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down.</i> Zen teacher
          Haemin Sunim describes with great clarity the suffocating effect of
          perfectionism—how damaging it is to think your worth as a person is
          solely dependent on how you perform. Then, page by page, he shows you
          how to reclaim your freedom and your life.” —<b

          ><br /><br />“The Buddha, somewhat rebelliously, declared that,
          instead of a god or guru, the starting point of our path to awakening
          is our very own imperfections. I’m so happy to see Haemin Sunim giving
          fresh voice to practices that help us befriend ourselves, so that we
          can become our own best caregivers.” —<b

          stories from Sunim’s own life, the book contains thought-provoking
          aphorisms. . . . A breezy book with generally helpful reminders, wise
          advice, and pithy sayings to soothe the challenges of hectic life.”

          that is akin to a warm embrace. . . . Although many self-help books
          preach triumphal purpose-seeking, Sunim astonishes by saying, ‘I don’t
          think life has something grand in store for me.’ . . . &nbsp;The book
          is worth repeated readings on a commuter train, at bedtime, or as part
          of a morning routine.” —<i><b>Booklist</b></i

          Haemin is especially eloquent on life’s smaller dissatisfactions, and
          how they can sometimes be trickier to deal with than the bigger, more
          dramatic ones.” —<b
