          A rare look into the history, theory, and craft of the black mages and
          sorcerers of Russia <br /><br />• Examines practical rituals and
          spells, the demonic pantheon, places of power, offerings and
          sacrifices, Hell Icons, and instructions for cemetery magic
          <br /><br />• Provides insight into the fundamental ideology of black
          magic practitioners, from the universal laws of magic to the
          principles of morality <br /><br />• Details how the Russian practice
          of black magic preserved ancient pagan traditions and evolved as the
          antithesis of Christianity <br /><br />Born in the Soviet Union and
          descended from a matrilineal line of witches, Natasha Helvin offers a
          rare look into the secret practices of Russian black magic, passed
          down from teacher to disciple for generations both orally and through
          their grimoires bound in black. Drawing from her own experience,
          Helvin provides insight into the fundamental ideology of black magic
          practitioners, from the universal laws of magic to the principles of
          morality. She explains a mage’s view on fate and predestination, how
          the world was created, and their relationship with the demons that
          grant them their power. She examines the demonic pantheon as well as
          how a black sorcerer is able to influence the forces in the universe
          and pass on his or her powers and knowledge to further generations.
          <br /><br />Exploring the history of occult practices in Russia,
          including how Christianity had a profound effect upon magic and
          witchcraft, Helvin shows how attempts to forcibly convert the Russian
          population to the Christian faith were widely resisted, and instead of
          these ancient pagan practices disappearing, they blended with
          Christian belief. Authorities repainted old pagan gods as demons in
          order to eradicate ancient traditions. Black magic became labelled as
          defiantly anti-Christian simply for preserving the old ways, and as a
          result, some branches of black magic evolved as a reaction against
          enforced Christianity and practitioners proudly accepted the label of
          “blasphemer” or “heretic.” <br /><br />Through this book, readers can
          explore the Left-Hand path of Russian magic and its spells and
          rituals. The author explains about cemetery magic, sacrifices, the
          creation of Hell Icons, and places of power, such as crossroads,
          swamps, and abandoned villages, as well as the best times to practice
          black magic, how to choose the best grave for your spell, and how to
          summon demons. Providing many concrete examples of spells, Helvin
          demonstrates the broad range of what can be accomplished by those who
          practice the black arts, if they commit themselves to the craft.
