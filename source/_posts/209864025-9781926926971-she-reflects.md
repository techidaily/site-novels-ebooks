          <p>
            She Reflects is a love letter and a call to action to anyone
            identifying with, or wishing to know, the feminine soul, to live
            life with more curiosity, creativity, compassion and courage. The
            author, Erica Ross, a dancer, artist, DJ and teacher who has
            followed her wild heart, creative impulses and freedom-loving spirit
            around the globe since the early 70s, invites us to journey through
            eight turns of a sacred spiral - a transformational and healing
            process of softening, listening, daring, shedding and celebrating.
            At each turn, Erica reflects on her own life and asks us to do the
            same through her personal stories (from the Hippie Trail of the 70s,
            to NYC’s early disco/house scene, to the magic of Bali in the 80s,
            to the present) reflections, best practices, goddess mythology,
            original artwork and music playlists (hosted at
            www.EricaRoss.com/playlists). The book, along with its accompanying
            <strong>She Reflects Journal &amp; Colouring Book</strong>, is what
            Erica calls “living proof that pain, loss and vulnerability can (and
            will) be transformed into art, creativity and healing.”

            “Part adventure tale, part guidebook, part meandering jazz that

            teacher, and an embodiment of the Sacred Feminine, Erica Ross
            invites us to live it all: the mess and the magnificence; the poetry

          <p><strong>Bio:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Erica Ross is a left-handed extrovert, wanderer, and lover and maker
            of beautiful things and sacred spaces. Growing up in a home of
            dance, art, love and activism, and with over 40 years in the
            creative, healing and spiritual arts, Erica offers the wisdom of her
            life experience as a dancer, artist, DJ, group facilitator, trainer
            and mother. Erica has followed her wild heart, creative impulses and
            freedom-loving spirit around the globe since the early 70s, making
            homes in Canada, the USA, Indonesia and Wales. For the last 20 years
            she’s dedicated herself to the liberation and healing of the
            feminine soul; to come home to, and fall in love with, ourselves and
            each other through her award-winning practice, Dance Our Way Home,
            plus her facilitator and expressive arts trainings, workshops,
            retreats and programs (locally, internationally and virtually).
            Dance Our Way Home is a magical brew of ecstatic dance and
            sisterhood rooted in divine feminine and earth-based spirituality
            and teachings, love and creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Erica is the mother of a grown daughter, and lives with her partner
            in Toronto where she creates art. Wherever she is, Erica finds magic
            and friends, sees life as a sacred experiment, and practices keeping
            her heart open, regardless. This is her first book.

          “She Reflects is a gift from a wise woman who has journeyed into the
          depths of her own soul and across the globe. Offered with a rare and
          warm kindness, Erica masterfully weaves memoir with inclusive
          resources, practices and stunning artwork as a mythological and
          practical road map to evoke the creative feminine (a source of love
          and nurturance for all, regardless of gender or sex) and expand our
          capacity to reflect, heal and be clear mirrors for others.” - Nan
