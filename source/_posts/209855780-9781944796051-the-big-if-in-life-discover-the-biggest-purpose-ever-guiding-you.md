            The Big <strong>IF</strong> in Life&nbsp; encourages you to Be
            Fearlessly Inquisitive and to Live a Rich, Eye-Opening, and
            Brilliant Life! This book is a spiritual warm-up to exercise your
            thinking about life's actual purpose and your untapped options for
            living life with the utmost dignity, in harmony with the Creator's
            intention. To understand the authentic nature of the
            <strong>"IF"</strong> is to grasp the actual power of your free-will
            choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>"IF"</strong> is the bull's eye to penetrate in each
            chapter--the focal point with a freeing, refreshing perception. You
            get a clean slate within your being and consciousness, like hitting
            a psyche (thinking-feeling) restart button. Clarity changes
            everything and frees you from the confusion of overly complicated
            approaches to God.
          </p>
          <p>
            For ease of grasping the metaphysical and abstract subject matter of
            Who-I-Am and "Why am I here?" the author uses metaphors to drive the
            message's deepest meanings home, and she does so in a way that
            anyone can understand. It's a big message everyone truly wants to
            know about, yet no one is talking about it in this manner.
          </p>

          </p>
          Do you sense simple, logical, honest answers to God-Creator questions
          and meaning of life exist?Do you feel spiritual answers are within
          your reach and they're neither as convoluted nor as mystical as
          assumed to be?Do you desire more intimate, personal growth
          relationship with your Higher Spiritual SELF and the Creator?Do you
          wish you could easily understand God and this universe despite their
          profound depths?Do you sense a simple Sacred story of TRUTH buried
          within life's stories and theological-metaphysical conundrums?Do you
          think religion has come to its end-of-life cycle and is in need of an
          infusion of Higher Knowingness beyond New Age offerings?
