          This volume is a study of the symbols of cosmic origins. It throws a
          new and searching light upon <i>The Stanzas of Dzyan,</i> a
          little-known collection of cosmogenic verses relating to cosmogenesis
          as set forth in H. P. Blavatsky’s great work
          <i>The Secret Doctrine.</i>

            “We are considering the universe as a tissue of psychic experience,”
            say the authors. “Our categories are psychic ones, and with their
            help we have attempted to show that the process of conscious
            manifestation is entirely a movement within the unity of
            consciousness being toward the achievement of self-conscious
            experience.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Sri Madhava Ashish</b> (1920–1997) was a Scottish-born naturalized
          Indian spiritualist, mystic, writer, and agriculturist. When World War
          II ended, he stayed on in India to continue his spiritual searches. He
          moved to Mirtola Ashram, a spiritual base at the foothills of the
          Himalayas. He also took up the name Madhava Ashish. When Sri Krishna
          Prem, head of the ashram, died in 1965, Ashish became the head and
          oversaw the management of the institution until his death. He was the
          author of <i>What Is Man?; Man, Son of Man;</i> and
          <i>An Open Window.</i> In 1992, the Indian government awarded him the
          civilian honor of the Padma Shri for his contributions to the
          agriculture sector in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Sri Krishna Prem</b> (1898–1965) was a British spiritual aspirant
          who went to India in the early twentieth century. Together with his
          spiritual teacher Sri Yashoda Mai, he founded an ashram at Mirtola,
          India. The ashram has continued to be aligned with strict orthodox
          Vishnavism. Despite his English origins, Krishna Prem became widely
          accepted and admired in the Indian Hindu community and had many Indian
          disciples. Krishna Prem transcended the gomas and practices of his
          early Vaishnava sectarianism and affirmed a universal spiritual path.
