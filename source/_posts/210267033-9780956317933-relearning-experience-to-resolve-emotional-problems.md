              >Relearning Experience Process is a new psychological theory and
              therapeutic practice</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The book provides a comprehensive
            <strong
              >psychological theory of the genesis, development and
              manifestation of therapeutic or clinical problems</strong
            >, making the book indispensable reading for psychotherapists,
            clinical practitioners and all serious students of human motivation
            and psychology. The method described in the book,
            <strong>Relearning Experience Process</strong>, explains how to
            identify the <strong>origins of a therapeutic problem </strong>in a
            person's biography and transform behaviour, thereby resolving the
            therapeutic problem.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p><strong>The origins&nbsp;of problems</strong></p>
          <p>
            Although the original experience underlying the problem behaviour is
            ordinarily unknown and unconscious, it can be discovered by a simple
            process called 'tracking back'. This process identifies the
            <strong>origin of almost any psychological problem </strong>within
            minutes. Once the experience has been identified,
            <strong
              >the therapeutic problem is resolved through a 'relearning' of
              that experience</strong
            >. The relearning provides an alternative reference so that the body
            can unlearn the original, pathological response.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>The book is an exposition of the following ideas</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            (1) A therapeutic problem is created when, in response to a
            difficult experience, a person develops behaviour that serves to
            ameli- orate the threat to her personal dignity (emotional
            wellbeing).
          </p>
          <p>
            (2) This behaviour, developed as a solution in a moment of crisis,
            sets an unconscious and involuntary precedent for future behaviour
            in circumstances perceived to be similar.
          </p>
          <p>
            (3) Activated automatically by feelings, this behaviour becomes a
            therapeutic problem if it interferes with what the person wants.
          </p>
          <p>
            (4) The difficult experience that occurred at the genesis of the
            therapeutic problem is discoverable via the feelings associated with
            the problem behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            (5) An intervention at the origins of the problem which, in
            imagination, reconfigures the original behaviour, enables the person
            to choose her behaviour freely in the present, and resolves the
            thera- peutic problem completely and permanently.

          Occasionally, a book arises out of profound insight.&nbsp;<strong
            >Relearning Experience</strong
          >
          is one such book.

        <p>
          For over thirty years, I have approached my coaching and therapeutic
          work from the perspective that it is not what happens in our lives
          that shapes how we live, but how we <strong>experience</strong> what
          happens.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          Early in Jonathan's text we are teased with the audacious idea that
          the best therapy for a person's problem might be if the problem never
          occurred in the first place - that if the original experience were a
          more helpful one, then the therapeutic problem wouldn't
          exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although introduced in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek
          way, this notion is later revealed as a profound base concept.&nbsp;By
          daring to reframe therapy in this way, and by embracing the powerful
          role that imagination plays in shaping our experiences, Jonathan has
          developed a faster, more effective, and less agonizing approach that
          will enable competent practitioners to help more people heal their
          therapeutic problems, quickly and permanently, more of the time.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          I have long believed that the true masters of talking therapies are
          those that deeply understand first principles, and work from them,
          constantly improving and developing their practice as their insight
          expands.&nbsp;In this new work, Jonathan Livingstone not only
          demonstrates the depth and breadth of his insight but reveals how
          first principles sit at the core of outstanding professional
          practice.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the form of an extended interview the writing style takes a bit
          of getting used to.&nbsp;But it's delivered in a clear, skilful and
          clever manner, and affords the reader the benefit of learning from the
          positions of both observer and critic as the 'Mentor' reveals his
          thinking and practice.&nbsp;Soon, you find yourself imagining being in
          the room as the conversation is taking place.&nbsp;As the pages
          advance, so does the reader's engagement and insight - proving that
          Jonathan is as masterful a writer as he is a therapist.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          This is a thoroughly important new book for those working in the
          therapeutic space, not only introducing a groundbreaking new approach,
          but providing a useful refresh of what truly professional therapeutic
          practice should look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;
