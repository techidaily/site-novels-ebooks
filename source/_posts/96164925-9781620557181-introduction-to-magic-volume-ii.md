          Authentic initiatic practices, rituals, and wisdom collected by the UR
          Group <br /><br />• Shares a rigorous selection of initiatory
          exercises, including instructions for creating the diaphanous body of
          the <i>Opus magicum</i>, establishing initiatic consciousness after
          death, and the construction of magical chains (the enchained awareness
          of initiates) <br /><br />• Offers studies of mystery traditions
          throughout history, presenting not only the principles themselves but
          also witnesses to them and their continual validity today
          <br /><br />The “Gruppo di UR” was a group of Italian esotericists who
          collaborated from 1927 to 1929. The purpose of this group was to study
          and practice ancient rituals gleaned from the mystery traditions of
          the world, both East and West, in order to attain a state of
          superhuman consciousness and power to allow them to act magically on
          the world. They produced a monthly journal containing techniques for
          spiritual realization, accounts of personal experiences, translations
          of ancient texts, and original essays on esoteric topics. The group
          included a distinguished line-up of occultists, neo-pagans,
          freemasons, Anthroposophists, orientalists, poets, and members of high
          society. The prime movers of the group were Arturo Reghini
          (1878-1946), a Pythagorean mathematician and reviver of a spiritual
          Freemasonry, and Julius Evola (1898-1974), then a young philosopher
          with a precocious mastery of the esoteric doctrines of East and West.
          Many years later, in 1971, Evola gathered these essays into three
          volumes. Inner Traditions published Volume I in 2001, under the title
          <i
            >Introduction to Magic: Rituals and Practical Techniques for the
            Magus</i
          >. <br /><br />This volume, the second in the series, complements the
          first one, yet they are not strictly sequential, and their contents
          can be read in any order. Volume II shares authentic initiatic wisdom
          and a rigorous selection of initiatory exercises, including
          instructions for creating the diaphanous body of the
          <i>Opus magicum</i>, establishing initiatic consciousness after death,
          and the construction of magical chains (the enchained awareness of
          initiates). It offers studies of mystery traditions throughout
          history, presenting not only the principles themselves but also
          witnesses to them and their continual validity today. <br /><br />This
          series shows that the “Magic” of the UR Group meant an active and
          affirmative attitude toward individual development, handed down from a
          “primordial tradition” and discernable in alchemy, Hermetism, esoteric
          religious doctrines, indigenous practices, Tantra, Taoism, Buddhism,
          Vedanta, and the pagan mysteries of the West. Although some of the
          practical experiments demanded extraordinary efforts, both individual
          and collective, there is incalculable value here even for the less
          heroic, for merely reading these essays leaves a permanent mark on the
          reader.

          A controversial philosopher and critic of modern Western civilization,
          Julius Evola (1898-1974) is considered one of the foremost authorities
          on the world’s esoteric traditions. He wrote widely on Eastern
          religions, alchemy, sexuality, politics, and mythology and published
          many books, including <i>Revolt Against the Modern World</i>.
