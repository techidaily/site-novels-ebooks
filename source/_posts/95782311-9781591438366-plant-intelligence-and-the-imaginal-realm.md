          A manual for opening the doors of perception and directly engaging the
          intelligence of the Natural World <br />
          <br />• Provides exercises to directly perceive and interact with the
          complex, living, self-organizing being that is Gaia <br />
          <br />• Reveals that every life form on Earth is highly intelligent
          and communicative <br />
          <br />• Examines the ecological function of invasive plants, bacterial
          resistance to antibiotics, psychotropic plants and fungi, and the
          human species <br />
          <br />In <i>Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm</i>, Stephen
          Harrod Buhner reveals that all life forms on Earth possess
          intelligence, language, a sense of I and not I, and the capacity to
          dream. He shows that by consciously opening the doors of perception,
          we can reconnect with the living intelligences in Nature as kindred
          beings, become again wild scientists, nondomesticated explorers of a
          Gaian world just as Goethe, Barbara McClintock, James Lovelock, and
          others have done. For as Einstein commented, “We cannot solve the
          problems facing us by using the same kind of thinking that created
          them.” <br />
          <br />Buhner explains how to use analogical thinking and imaginal
          perception to directly experience the inherent meanings that flow
          through the world, that are expressed from each living form that
          surrounds us, and to directly initiate communication in return. He
          delves deeply into the ecological function of invasive plants,
          bacterial resistance to antibiotics, psychotropic plants and fungi,
          and, most importantly, the human species itself. He shows that human
          beings are not a plague on the planet, they have a specific ecological
          function as important to Gaia as that of plants and bacteria. <br />
          <br />Buhner shows that the capacity for depth connection and
          meaning-filled communication with the living world is inherent in
          every human being. It is as natural as breathing, as the beating of
          our own hearts, as our own desire for intimacy and love. We can change
          how we think and in so doing begin to address the difficulties of our
          times.

          “Stephen Harrod Buhner’s <i>The Lost Language of Plants</i> and
          <i>The Secret Teaching of Plants</i> taught a generation of herbalists
          to trust our sense that the world was alive and speaking to us.
          <i>Plant Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm</i> takes us further down
          that path of remembering and re-enchantment, awakening our capacity to
          tap directly in to the Gaian mind. Be warned: if you read this book,
          you will never be the same again.”
