              >A Fascinating Exploration on Why the Darwinists’ Theory No Longer
              Explains Everything</b
            ><br />

          <p>
            There was once a set of ideas called the theory of evolution,
            conceived by clever people and confirmed by countless scientists.
            Then people discovered the electron microscope. This made it
            possible to make the molecules within the cell visible, and suddenly
            questions about evolution arose that were not possible before. Which
            force actually bundles the atoms in the right order? What moves the
            molecular chains into the correct position? How did the first living
            unit within the cell actually come about? How does inheritance work,
            how does information pass on to the next generation? Did humans
            descend only and exclusively from primates—as Charles Darwin and
            countless other great minds assumed—or did additional “engines”
            intervene in evolution? <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Today it is clear: countless questions can no longer be answered
            with the previous theory of evolution. There is a form of life
            called “Blob” (Physarum polycephalum). The “thing” has neither eyes
            nor ears, neither a mouth nor a nose or even a brain. Nevertheless,
            it takes in food, overcomes obstacles by the shortest route and
            exchanges information with other “blobs.” The “blob” contradicts any
            evolutionary thought that one develops from the other. Or the
            “gastric-brooding frogs” (Rheobatrachus) found in Australia. They
            hatch their young in the stomach. Impossible in a slow, evolutionary
            process. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Everywhere there are characteristics of animals that do not want to
            fit into the theory of evolution anywhere. And man? Are we really
            the most adapted life-form on this planet? Today, more and more
            scientists who contradict the previous theory of evolution speak
            out. The theory fits the changes within the species, but it can no
            longer be reconciled with the inner workings of the cell. Some other
            influence that has so far escaped us is affecting evolution. It is
            called “Intelligent Design.” Intelligent planning is suspected
            behind this. Anyone or anything—a spirit of the universe?
            Aliens?—could be behind this planning. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Erich von Däniken uses countless examples to demonstrate the
            impossibility of the previous evolutionary idea. He quotes
            scientists who argue against the previous teaching, but also those
            who defend it. Unfortunately, established science still refuses to
            look at discrepancies and holes in the theory of evolution, even
            though it is quite obvious that there is more going on with regard
            to the development of all species, as well as human culture, than
            could be explained by the theory of evolution alone. <br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Erich von Däniken</b> is arguably the most widely read and
          most-copied nonfiction author in the world. He published his first
          (and best-known) book, <i>Chariots of the Gods,</i> in 1968. His
          research organization, the A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com, comprises
          laymen and academics from all walks of life. He lives in Switzerland
          but is an ever-present figure on the international lecture circuit,
          traveling more than 100,000 miles a year.
