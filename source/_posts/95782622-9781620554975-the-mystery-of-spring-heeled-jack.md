          An extensive investigation of the origins and numerous sightings of
          the mysterious and terrifying figure known as Spring-Heeled Jack
          <br />
          <br />• Shares original 19th-century newspaper accounts of
          Spring-Heeled Jack encounters as well as 20th and 21st-century reports
          <br />
          <br />• Explains his connections to Jack the Ripper and the Slender
          Man <br />
          <br />• Explores his origins in earlier mythical beings from folklore,
          his Steampunk popularity, and the theory that he may be an alien from
          a high-gravity planet <br />
          <br />Spring-Heeled Jack--a tall, thin, bounding figure with bat-like
          wings, clawed hands, wheels of fire for eyes, and breath of blue
          flames--first leapt to public attention in Victorian London in 1838,
          springing over hedges and walls, from dark lanes and dank graveyards,
          to frighten and sometimes physically attack women. News of this
          strange and terrifying character quickly spread, but despite numerous
          sightings through 1904 he was never captured or identified. <br />
          <br />Exploring the vast urban legend surrounding this enigmatic
          figure, John Matthews explains how the Victorian fascination with
          strange phenomena and sinister figures paired with hysterical reports
          enabled Spring-Heeled Jack to be conjured into existence. Sharing
          original 19th-century newspaper accounts of Spring-Heeled Jack
          sightings and encounters, he also examines recent 20th and
          21st-century reports, including a 1953 UFO-related sighting from
          Houston, Texas, and disturbing accounts of the Slender Man, who
          displays notable similarities with Jack. He traces Spring-Heeled
          Jack’s origins to earlier mythical beings from folklore, such as fairy
          creatures and land spirits, and explores the theory that Jack is an
          alien marooned on Earth whose leaping prowess is attributed to his
          home planet having far stronger gravity than ours. <br />
          <br />The author reveals how Jack the Ripper, although a different and
          much more violent character, chose to identify himself with the old,
          well-established figure of Spring-Heeled Jack. Providing an extensive
          look at Spring-Heeled Jack from his beginnings to the present,
          Matthews illustrates why the worldwide Steampunk community has so
          thoroughly embraced Jack.

          “Probably no one in the world but John Matthews could have written
          this book. His scholarship is, as always, of the highest order yet
          joined to a deep love of stories. His unwillingness to make artificial
          separations between traditional folklore and popular culture allows
          Spring-Heeled Jack to come vigorously to life.”
