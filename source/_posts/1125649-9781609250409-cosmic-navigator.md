          Gahl Sasson's second book, <i>Cosmic Navigator</i>, is like a GPS for
          the soul. It combines Astrology, the map of where and who we are, with
          Kabbalah the navigation system that tells us how to get to our goal
          and avoid those traffic patterns and areas of gridlock in our lives.
          This three part text is the first book of its kind. Not only is it the
          first book to use Astrology as a resource for self help, it also weds
          the wisdom of ancient Kabbalisitic truths with the powerful archetypes
          of the zodiac to help you improve and change your life. The first part
          of the book introduces the basic concepts of Kabbalah and Astrology
          and how they work together. The second part teaches you how to
          interpret your own astrological chart as the road map of your life.
          The third and final part of the book, which is based on Gahl's twelve
          week workshop, walks the reader through the twelve signs and teaches
          them how to use each one to bring balance and success into their
          lives. Is your love life in need of more passion? Turn to the chapter
          on Scorpio and learn how to invoke that sexual mysterious energy. Do
          you need to be more assertive at work? Turn to the chapter on Aries
          and discover your inner warrior. Unlike other astrology books that
          simply offer stereotypical profiles, <i>Cosmic Navigator</i> teaches
          us how to take control of our astrological destinies.

          “Gahl has written a travel guide for the soul. He uses astrology and
          Kabbalah to show us the landscape for our lives. It s all quite
          practical and useful. His real magic is revealing the symbols that
          surround us but we never saw before.” -Tim Sexton, Oscar nominated
