              >Discover Spiritual Minimalism: the “inside-out” path to getting
              rid of inner clutter and living a more fulfilled life. </b
            ><br /><br />Everywhere you look, people in all walks of life are
            “going minimalist” and getting rid of their possessions. Yet as
            exciting as it can be to throw out half of your belongings, does it
            really bring happiness? As Light Watkins says: “If you’re unhappy
            now, becoming a minimalist isn’t likely to change that… unless you
            do the inner work to cultivate happiness on the inside.”<br /><br />Light
            is famous for taking minimalism to the extreme—and now lives his
            whole life out of a single backpack. In <i>Travel Light</i>, he
            shares his surprising revelation that being a “spiritual minimalist”
            means you don’t focus on material objects. What matters more than
            clearing out your closets is how much trust you have in your inner
            guidance. “Spiritual Minimalism is not about how much physical stuff
            you have,” he says. “It’s about how you communicate, incorporate
            service into your life, exercise, cook, clean, and express your
            love.”<br /><br />Light shares his unique inside-out approach to
            minimalism using stories, anecdotes, and vignettes, along with
            real-world experiments and exercises that you can adapt to your own
            life.<br /><br />Here you’ll learn how to:<br /><br />• Prioritize
            and cultivate inner happiness<br />• Make the most important
            decisions from your heart<br />• Get comfortable in the
            discomfort<br />• Live as though there are no throwaway moments<br />•
            Tap in to your curiosity as a gateway to your true path<br />• The
            “freedom of choicelessness”—decluttering your life decisions<br /><br />You’ll
            be invited to discover the joy of giving what you want to receive;
            following your curiosity; and living with a “clutter-free” approach
            to your choices, values, and life purpose. Implementing the
            principles of Spiritual Minimalism will get you aligned with your
            values and lead you to a life-changing adventure!

          "Watkins’s tone is appealingly conversational, and his lucid prose and
          easy-to-follow meditation exercises help bring the sometimes abstract
          contours of spiritual minimalism down to earth." —<b
            >Publishers Weekly</b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Travel Light</i> ultimately serves as a
          breath-of-fresh-air guide for how to be present in the modern day.
          Light’s words and stories feel like a good friend that helps bring you
          back to your most important relationship when things get a little
          messy—the relationship with your Self.” —<b>Adriene Mishler,</b>
          founder of Yoga with Adriene and Find What Feels Good<br /><br />“<i
            >Travel Light</i
          >
          encourages readers to follow their curiosity, to live authentically to
          their inner guidance, and to always make decisions from the heart.
          Then every day becomes a new opportunity to do something that changes
          the course of the rest of our lives.” —<b>Sharon Salzberg,</b> author
          of <i>Lovingkindness</i> and <i>Real Happiness</i><br /><br />“Light
          has lived out of a backpack now for four years. This is not a stunt or
          a gimmick but the commitment of a serious man to living a life based
          on the truths of the Inner World and the infallible wisdom of the
          heart. <i>Travel Light</i> is the best possible portal—and Light
          Watkins, the most generous and soulful guide—to this experience and
          this discipline. Can I give <i>Travel Light</i> six stars?” —<b
            >Steven Pressfield,</b
          >
          author of <i>The War of Art</i><br /><br />“This book is full of
          simply told, relatable stories that will leave you inspired to start
          traveling light on your very next trip.” —<b>Leon Logothetis,</b>
          author and creator of <i>The Kindness Diaries</i><br /><br />“Light is
          a true master at taking complex practices like meditation and
          minimalism, and not only simplifying them but inspiring you to try
          them as well. <i>Travel Light</i> is a must-have for every spiritual
          practitioner.” —<b>Chip Conley,</b> bestselling author and founder of
          the Modern Elder Academy<br /><br />“<i>Travel Light</i> is a
          concentrated distillate on all things simple whenever your life feels
          bloated, creaky, and full. Take two pages and call me in the morning.”
          —<b>Neil Pasricha,</b> bestselling author of <i>The Book of Awesome</i
          ><br /><br />“Light’s unique approach to minimalism is so refreshing.
          This is just the book for showing you how to move through life in a
          way that truly serves what’s in your heart.” —<b>Kute Blackson,</b>
          bestselling author of <i>The Magic of Surrender</i><br /><br />“After
          reading and inhaling the message of <i>Travel Light</i>, for the first
          time in my life I traveled to Europe with a carry-on, inspired by
          Light’s philosophy and way of living. I found the joy of letting go of
          excess baggage inwardly and outwardly. Read this book, and then give
          it away to a friend, and carry it in your heart. It will free your
          mind and spirit!” —<b>Agapi Stassinopoulos,</b> bestselling author of
          <i>Speaking with Spirit</i><br /><br />“Light is such a great
          storyteller. You can crack <i>Travel Light</i> open to any page, and
          before you know it, you will be inspired to give this unique style of
          minimalism a try.” —<b>Lewis Howes,</b> author and founder of
          <i>The School of Greatness</i><br /><br />“<i>Travel Light</i> reminds
          us that our most important possession is our inner guidance. And that
          when we make room to follow that voice within us, we become aligned
          with the true abundance of life.” —<b>Ava DuVernay,</b> award-winning
          filmmaker<br /><br />“Light is speaking my language in his beautiful
          new book. Spiritual minimalism is a much-needed antidote to our
          seemingly endless scramble to get somewhere, to be someone, and to
          make things happen. Our harried, busy, distracted lives are not only
          bad for the planet but also bad for us. Thanks, Light, for directing
          us on a different path.” —<b>Pam Grout,</b> #1
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>E-Squared</i> and
          nineteen other books<br /><br />“It’s so easy to get hung up on mental
          clutter. In <i>Travel Light</i>, my friend Light Watkins not only
          shows you how to declutter your mind but also provides you with
          step-by-step instructions for connecting with your inner guidance to
          live a more fulfilled life.” —<b>Mark Hyman, MD,</b> bestselling
          author of <i>Young Forever</i>
