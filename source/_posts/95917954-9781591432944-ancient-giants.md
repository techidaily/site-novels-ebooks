          Investigates physical evidence, history, and myths to reveal the lost
          race of giants that once dominated the world <br /><br />• Reveals
          suppressed archaeological and scientific discoveries supporting the
          existence of a worldwide race of giants <br /><br />• Examines giant
          myths and legends from ancient religious texts and literature from
          around the world <br /><br />• Includes findings from throughout
          Europe (Britain, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Russia), the
          Middle East (Israel, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Iran), Africa, Australia,
          New Zealand, and the Far East (China, Japan, Malaysia, and the
          Philippines) <br /><br />From the Nephilim and Goliath in the Bible to
          the Titans in Greek mythology and the Fomorians and Frost Giants in
          Celtic and Nordic lore, almost every culture around the world has
          spoken of an ancient race of giants. Giant footprints left in the
          geological bedrock, tens of thousands of years old, have been
          discovered in India, China, and the war-torn lands of Syria. Giant
          bones and full skeletons have been found in Europe, the Middle East,
          Africa, Australia, and Asia. Yet despite mounting evidence, mainstream
          science continues to consign these findings to the fringe.
          <br /><br />Examining global myths, historical records, megalithic
          ruins, and archaeological findings, Xaviant Haze provides compelling
          evidence for a lost race of giants in Earth’s prehistory. He explores
          myths that go back thousands of years, including those found in the
          world’s holiest scriptures, as well as medieval and modern myths, such
          as Geoffrey of Monmouth’s account of the first kings of Britain and
          the stories of giant bones unearthed by Allied soldiers during World
          War II. He investigates historical reports of ancient giants found in
          Ireland and the British Isles—the remains of which mysteriously
          disappeared shortly after their discovery. He explores the legends of
          giants in Russia and goes deep into the Far East, revealing the
          multitude of fascinating giant legends in China. Haze explains how
          giants were responsible for the megalithic wonders of Malta and how
          the early settlers of Australia discovered the remains of giants but
          these findings were suppressed by the Royal Academies. He also
          explores the mythic origins of the giants: Were they the hybrid
          results from genetic experiments of ancient aliens or from the
          interbreeding of the fallen angels with the daughters of man?
          <br /><br />Covering legends and finds from throughout Europe, the
          Middle East, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East, Haze
          also presents--in its entirety--<i>The Book of Giants</i>, a portion
          of the Dead Sea Scrolls suppressed due to its overwhelming support for
          the existence of giants in antiquity.
