            Sometimes we all need a little lift—something to put the bounce back
            in our step. If you are like many, you may struggle with
            self-confidence. You may also compare your successes and failures
            with those of others. If everything is going well in your life, this
            tactic may temporarily bolster your sense of self-worth. But what
            happens when things aren’t going so well?
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on the idea that true self-esteem is grounded in internal,
            rather than external factors, this book offers 50 easy-to-use
            mindfulness practices that will help you improve inner awareness and
            live a more fulfilled life without harsh self-judgment. Mindfulness
            can help you battle feelings of low self-worth by encouraging you to
            pay attention to your negative thoughts as they occur, accept them,
            and ultimately control of how you react to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exercises in this pocket-sized book are intended to be simple,
            brief, and powerful. These are practices to settle into each
            morning, perhaps before your cup of tea or coffee, and which can be
            sprinkled throughout the day when you are at work, play, or home. To
            help you keep track of your thoughts, the book also includes
            journaling exercises that will help you discover what actions may
            have led to feelings of positivity or negativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            By focusing on your own awareness and thought processes, you will
            begin to understand what factors cause you to feel bad about
            yourself, and honestly assess those factors without giving in to
            feelings of hopelessness. You will discover that true self-esteem
            has less to do with what the world is telling you, and has
            everything to do with what you tell yourself.
