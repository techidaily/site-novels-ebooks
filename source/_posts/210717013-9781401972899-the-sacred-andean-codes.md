            >Discover powerful energetic rites based on Andean shamanic
            teachings to heal the wounds of your past, further your spiritual
            evolution, and reveal your sacred purpose.</b
          ><br /><br />Our world is desperately in need of a new compass and the
          rites of the Munay-Ki, which have been crafted for a Western audience,
          offer shamanic wisdom for the modern person. These initiations—based
          on initiatory practices of the shamans of the Andes and the Amazon—are
          profoundly healing and will alchemize your deepest wounds and limiting
          beliefs into sources of compassion. They encourage you to grow your
          love and empathy and see the interconnectedness of all life as you
          join a lineage of healers and Earthkeepers.
          <i>The Sacred Andean Codes</i> includes detailed explanations of each
          rite’s benefits, how it came to be, and how you can incorporate its
          wisdom into your own life. As a powerful blueprint for
          self-realization, these initiations invite you on a heartfelt
          evolutionary path with love at its core. Embark on your own sacred
          journey, recognize your innate wholeness, tune into unlimited energy,
          and fulfill your potential as a luminous being—and an agent of change
          and transformation in the world.

        <p>
          Long before the birth of modern science, the secrets of life were
          revealed and preserved for future generations among a clan of
          wisdomkeepers hidden high in the mountains of the Peruvian Andes.
          Marcela Lobos reveals these ancient secrets and more in her book
          <i>The Sacred Andean Codes.</i> In an intimate sharing of her
          apprenticeship with the descendants of that clan—the Q’uero people of
          today—Lobos reveals how the direct experience of the Munay-Ki
          initiations can shape our perception of life’s challenges, while
          leading us into our deepest healing and highest dreams. Whether you’re
          an artist or an engineer, a homemaker or policy maker, this book is
          about you, your life, and every relationship that you’ll ever
          experience. Lobos’ compelling truths of earth wisdom linger in our
          hearts long after we read the pages of
          <i>The Sacred Andean Codes, </i>reminding us that we’re always more
          than the challenges that life brings to our doorstep. — Gregg Braden,
          New York Times best-selling author of The God Code and The Divine
          Matrix<br /><br /><i>The Sacred Andean Codes</i> is a magnificent
          book. Marcela Lobos gives us a comprehensive understanding of the
          Munay-Ki initiations. The wisdom of these 10 initiations will connect
          you with your authentic self and root you in the flow of life. Marcela
          is the perfect person to transmit these powerful rites to us. She
          writes and teaches in a masterful way while bringing in deep feminine
          wisdom. You will learn how to reach your highest spiritual
          potential—this is a true gift Marcela shares with us in this beautiful
          book. — Sandra Ingerman, international shamanic teacher and
          award-winning author of 12 books, including Soul Retrieval: Mending
          the Fragmented Self and The Book of Ceremony<br /><br />Most current
          books about creating a better life focus on speed: life hacks,
          shortcuts, and mechanistic systems. But true transformation lies
          beyond such strategies. In <i>The Sacred Andean Codes,</i> Marcela
          Lobos encourages us to find our inherent wisdom by slowing down. She
          writes lovingly and clearly about the Munay-Ki (10 shamanic
          initiations) as a time-honored way to connect with and empower your
          true self. Her work will help you go beyond self-help to encounter
          true spiritual awakening. — Susan Piver, New York Times best-selling
          author of The Buddhist Enneagram<br /><br />Marcela Lobos offers
          simple, accessible, and inclusive insights to navigate this turbulent
          period in our planet’s history, so that we may evolve from passive
          victims to responsible co-creators of the world to come.
          <i>The Sacred Andean Codes</i> is an important contribution toward
          healing societal dysfunction and ensuring the healthy development of
          future generations. This book will inspire your spirit as you
          comprehend the enormous potential of applying this information in your
          life. — Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D., author of the best-selling books The
          Biology of Belief, Spontaneous Evolution, and The Honeymoon Effect<br /><br />In
          these changing times, Marcela’s book guides us like a potent ray of
          light to awaken and expand our consciousness and to transform heavy
          energies into love. This is precisely what is most important in the
          dawn of the new day . . . and that we share our real selves—the light
          that shines from our inner sun. This book is a brilliant guide to
          conquer our own selves. Thank you, Marcela, for your luminous
          contribution to life! — Jorge Luis Delgado, author of Andean
          Awakening: An Inca Guide to Mystical Peru
