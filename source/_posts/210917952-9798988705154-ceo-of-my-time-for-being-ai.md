              >Each one of us has a perception of reality that is shaped by a
              number of factors, such as our senses, our experiences, our
              beliefs, our emotions, and our perspectives. This book draws from
              personal experiences, culture, technology, genes, philosophy, and
              attempts to reveal a path that systematically unveils the tools to
              understanding ourselves better and as a result unlock the
              potential deep within us. If we believe that the world is a
              dangerous place, we may be more likely to interpret events in a
              negative way. Conversely, if we believe that the world is a
              friendly place, we may be more likely to interpret events in a
              positive way. By creating an awareness of how these perceptions of
              reality are influential and understanding how our minds work, we
              can become more objective in our thinking and make better informed
              decisions.&nbsp;</span

              >Technology growth has fueled our communications by helping us
              stay in touch with friends and family anywhere in the world,
              collaborate with colleagues &amp; clients located anywhere in the
              world, provided accessibility to almost unlimited information and
              knowledge at the click of a few buttons, improved quality of life
              for people with disabilities, wearables to monitor our health and
              fitness. Despite all these life enriching experiences, there is a
              deep sense of anxiety, fear, and tension that is tied to newer
              innovations like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and many other
              products.

              >Embark on this unique transformational journey with author Rajeev
              Nalawadi to analyze from an engineer's perspective the concepts of
              I, Me, Mine, You in our lives. When we see ourselves as "I", we
              are seeing ourselves as separate from the world around us. When we
              see ourselves as "me", we are seeing ourselves as a collection of
              thoughts, feelings, and experiences. When we see ourselves as
              "mine", we are seeing ourselves as attached to things and people
              in the material world. When we see ourselves as "you", we are
              seeing ourselves as connected to all other beings in the
              universe.</span

              more fulfilling life amidst the wave of breakneck speed
              innovations about to be introduced. Tapping into the field of all
              possibilities is within reach for all of us, it just needs to be
              explored the right way. Rather than being overwhelmed by the blast
              of technological innovations headed our way, we can use some
              techniques to manage our life's transformations in a way that can
              instill peace, and calmness.</span
