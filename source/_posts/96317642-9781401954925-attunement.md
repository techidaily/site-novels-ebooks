            Marisa opens the door for even the most cautiousamong us to
            experience the support of our beloved helpers on the other side.”—
            Sonia Choquette, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
            <i>The Answer Is Simple</i> and <i>Ask Your Guides</i><br /></b
          ><br />In <i>Attunement</i>, gifted clairvoyant and spiritual teacher
          Marisa Moris introduces you to the Creator Self, your highest state of
          individual consciousness and awareness from Source. Using a teaching
          she calls the Soul House, she takes you through the different layers
          of your soul to discover who you are on all levels. Through practical
          and easy visualizations, you will learn to use your quantum nature to
          cleanse your mind, body, and soul with Spirit. The clear connection
          you will acquire to your Spirit through the use of these tools will
          deepen your understanding of the extrasensory gifts you were born with
          and fine tune the gifts you have had your entire life. This book will
          change your life by bringing awareness to the fact that you are just
          that, <i>awareness</i>. It will walk you through changing your life in
          ways you never imagined!<br /><br />Throughout, Marisa shares personal
          stories from her spiritual awakening and the steps that have led her
          to her present abilities. She offers simple exercises and attunements
          to tap into these powerful energies, to become fully aligned and
          connected to your soul’s mission. These techniques include
          meditations, grounding exercises, energy clearings, visualizations,
          journaling prompts, and more. You’ll also receive powerful, loving
          channeled messages from Marisa’s guides.<br /><br />When you begin to
          align with Source and embody your Creator Self, the stresses and
          blocks in life no longer seem so difficult. The things you want will
          magically appear. The things you can’t get rid of just disappear.<br /><br />Get
          ready to meet your Creator Self. The journey you are about to go on
          will be so much fun!
