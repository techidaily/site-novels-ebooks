          ><br /><br />Well-known psychic and ghost hunter, Echo Bodine, started
          seeing spirits as a young girl and has been helping to set them free
          for decades. Most of these spirits have one thing in common—unfinished
          business from their lives that leaves them restless, unable to let go
          and move on. Some souls choose to remain closer to this dimension
          rather than move into the light when they die.<br /><br />Here, Bodine
          shares her experiences and compelling investigations that have led her
          to see the issues from a spirit's living time on Earth which have left
          them restless and unable to cross over. Each story is accompanied by
          an exercise that will help the reader avoid the fate of a trapped,
          angry, or unprepared soul.<br /><br />Some reasons spirits haven't
          gone through the light include:They don't know they're dead.They are
          afraid of what could be waiting for them on the other side.They don't
          believe in an afterlife so they’re stuck in limbo.They are possessive
          over a person or object.They are terrified of change.<br /><b
            ><i>How To Live a Happily Ever Afterlife</i></b
          >&nbsp;is an eye-opening look at spirits—at what compels and holds
          them—and what you can do to avoid the same fate.<br />
