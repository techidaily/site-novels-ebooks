          • Details how the author and her boyfriend developed a close
          friendship with Manly Hall and how Hall at first mistook her boyfriend
          as his heir apparent <br /><br />• Explains how Hall adopted the
          author as his “girl Friday” and personal weirdo screener, giving her
          access to the inner circles of occult Los Angeles <br /><br />• Richly
          depicts the characters who worked and gathered at Hall’s Philosophical
          Research Society, including Hall’s wife, the famed “Mad Marie”
          <br /><br />In the early 1980s, underground musicians Tamra Lucid and
          her boyfriend Ronnie Pontiac discovered the book The Secret Teachings
          of All Ages at the Bodhi Tree bookstore in Los Angeles. Poring over
          the tome, they were awakened to the esoteric and occult teachings of
          the world. Tamra and Ronnie were delighted to discover that the book’s
          author, Manly Palmer Hall (1901-1990), master teacher of Hermetic
          mysteries and collector of all things mystical, lived in LA and gave
          lectures every Sunday at his mystery school, the Philosophical
          Research Society (PRS). After their first tantalizing Sunday lecture,
          Tamra and Ronnie soon started volunteering at the PRS, beginning a
          seven-year friendship with Manly P. Hall, who eventually officiated
          their wedding in his backyard.<br /><br />In this touching, hilarious,
          and ultimately tragic autobiographical account, Tamra shares an
          intimate portrait of Hall and the occult world of New Age Los Angeles,
          including encounters with astrologers, scholars, artists, spiritual
          seekers, and celebrities such as Jean Houston and Marianne Williamson.
          Tamra vividly describes how she used her time at the PRS to learn
          everything she could not only about metaphysics but also about the
          people who practice it. But when Tamra begs Hall to banish a certain
          man from the PRS--the same man who inherited Hall’s estate and whom
          his wife Marie later alleged was Hall’s murderer--Tamra and Ronnie are
          the ones banished. <br /><br />Tamra’s noir chronicle of an improbable
          friendship between a twenty-something punk and an eighty-year-old
          metaphysical scholar reveals Hall not only as an inspiring esoteric
          thinker but also as a genuinely kind human being who simply wanted to
          share his quest for inner meaning and rare wisdom with the world.

          "This is a lovingly written story of an extraordinary person during a
          transformative time in America. Lucid's anecdotes illustrate a life of
          deep knowledge, serene wisdom, and sheer joy in BEING. Two very
          troubled kids stumble upon the Well of Wisdom and, for once not
          turning away in anger or violence, are transformed into remarkable
          humans. Anecdotes of Lucid's time are presented in small chapters, bon
          mots like bon bons, fresh and vivid. Thematically, the reader easily
          sees that the stories are about how Mr. Hall spoke the wisdom he knew,
          without attachment or expectation, the right words being heard by the
          right people at the right time."
