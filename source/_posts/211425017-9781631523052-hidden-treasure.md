          Are you looking for more personal growth or feel like you want
          something more from life, but you’re not sure where to start? In this
          award-winning book, author Alice McDowell, PhD, reveals how powerful,
          deeply embedded behavior patterns—often the result of wounds suffered
          early in life—can influence every aspect of your life and identity,
          and hide your true self. <i>Hidden Treasure</i> offers tools you will
          use again and again to help soften and heal these patterns, make sense
          of your life and relationships, and begin to live a full and radiant
          life.

          “Alice McDowell has brought us a gem with <i>Hidden Treasure</i>! She
          has masterfully shared with us her in-depth knowledge and clinical
          experience working with the 5 Belief Systems / Character Structure.
          The material is clear, practical, easy to understand, and the
          exercises are sure to deepen self-awareness on one’s transformational
          journey.”<br />
          —Anne Hoye, Dean, Barbara Brennan School of Healing and The Brennan
          Institute<br /><br />
          “<i>Hidden Treasure</i> provides a comprehensive, eye-opening
          exploration of five fundamental ways that humans distort their inner
          Light in order to ‘protect’ themselves from real or imagined harm. It
          is a pleasure to read, with abundant real-life vignettes that help to
          flesh out the subtle workings of each of the defense structures.
          Written with exceptional clarity, it offers a number of approaches for
          healing each structure, making it eminently useful to anyone motivated
          to grow emotionally, psychologically, or spiritually.” <br />
          —David Harman, PhD, Co-founder of Inner Source Healing and co-author
          of <i>The Way of Love</i><br /><br />
          “Based on decades of experience in guiding people towards
          psychological and spiritual wholeness, Alice McDowell introduces the
          five personality types of bio-enegetic therapy and shows how they can
          support self-healing and transformation. Practical, clear, and wise,
          this book is a precious gift to anyone seeking to understand the
          patterns that underlie their behavior.” <br />
          —Jalaja Bonheim, PhD, author of
          <i>The Sacred Ego: Making Peace with Ourselves and Our World</i
          ><br /><br />
          “<i>Hidden Treasure</i> will be of immense value to anyone who seeks a
          deeper understanding of the forces and circumstances that create the
          sense of self. Readers may be surprised to learn how the five basic
          character defenses McDowell describes manifest as distinguishable
          traits in the physical body. The treasure is the path of personal
          development and spiritual unfolding that knowledge of our character
          structure offers.” <br />
          —Lisa Loustanau,
          <i>Director of Education, Institute of Core Energetics</i>
          <br /><br />
          “Actions for the body, insights for the soul—Hidden Treasure is filled
          with gems polished by McDowell's patient, exacting, and extensive
          experience guiding people from many professions and life paths. She
          has synthesized a wise and gentle approach to human development and
          personal freedom that can be used alone or with others.” <br />
          —Mary Gilliland, author of <i>Gathering Fire</i>and the
          <i>Writing Walk-In Service Handbook</i>
