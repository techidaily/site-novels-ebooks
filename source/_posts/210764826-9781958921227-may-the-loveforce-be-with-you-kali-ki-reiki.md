            May the Loveforce Be With You is set to become a new classic in
            healing and mystical literature. The book introduces a new lineage
            in energy healing, Kali-Ki ReikiTM, that was revealed to the author,
            Joni Dittrich, Ph.D. (Rajashree Maa), in a series of mystical
            encounters with the Divine Mother appearing as the goddess Kali Maa.
            The book brilliantly tells the stories of these encounters and
            presents the healing symbols that She revealed, explaining how these
            symbols can be used both for mind-body healing and spiritual
            awakening, or what Rajashree Maa calls "wisening."
          </p>
          <p>
            While traditional reiki systems also use symbols to transmit healing
            energy, the symbols introduced in Kali-Ki Reiki are seen as unique,
            three-dimensional, active, intelligent forms of light that tap into
            certain universal energy frequencies that are particularly attuned
            to the evolving conscious awareness as well as the personal and
            societal dilemmas of our current times. The fact that these symbols
            were revealed by Divine Mother to a woman in this era points to a
            need in today's world to re-establish our connection with the
            feminine forces of nature and spirit. The healing energy transmitted
            through these symbols is called Loveforce, which is considered to be
            the manifesting, creative, and healing power of the Limitless Love
            that is the Source of all that is. Kali-Ki Reiki healing is
            understood as a means of bringing the entire human system into
            balance and alignment with our universal "Self" and the world around
            us, creating a wholeness of being that may have been previously cut
            off by stress, trauma, and cultural conditioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important teaching of this lineage is: "To heal one is to heal
            all." This is just one of the profound messages this new book brings
            to light.

          This book is a true account of traditional reiki and its derivate,
          Kali-Ki Reiki. It describes their effects and benefits in therapeutic
          healing and spiritual growth, as conveyed through the author's genuine
          experience.

          Suffused with ancient yogic wisdom, this system of healing and
          spiritual awakening has immense practical applications for our
          personal and societal well-being... [Kali-Ki Reiki] is a substantive
          example of the "new path" that embraces the evolution of consciousness
          with a non-dual perspective of existence.
