          >
          <br /><br />Paranormal investigator Zak Bagans, host of the popular
          Travel Channel series <i>Ghost Adventures</i>, pulls from his years of
          experience with paranormal activities and unexplained phenomena to
          provide an evenhanded look at a divisive subject. In
          <i>Dark World</i>, Zak does his best to find and share answers to the
          phenomena that people encounter. He wants you to experience a haunting
          through his eyes: to feel what it's like to be scared, freaked out,
          pushed, cold, sluggish, whispered-at, and touched by an ethereal being
          or attacked by a demonic spirit. But beyond simply experiencing these
          events, Zak is looking for the reasons behind them, searching for
          answers to the unanswered questions. Addressing all the major issues
          and theories of the field in an impartial way, <i>Dark World</i> is a
          must read for paranormal enthusiasts, those who don't believe, and
          anyone who's ever wondered about things that go bump in the night.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Zak Bagans</b> never believed in ghosts until he came face to face
          with one during a terrifying incident in a Michigan apartment. Not the
          passive type, Zak set out to learn more about the paranormal. In 2004
          he produced an award-winning documentary film that changed his life
          and the lives of many others when he captured one of the most shocking
          pieces of paranormal evidence ever. Now the host of two top-rated
          paranormal television shows, Zak has conducted hundreds of
          investigations into the unknown, becoming intimately familiar with the
          places ordinary people will not go. <br /><br /><b>Kelly Crigger</b>
          is not a paranormal investigator but has been intrigued by the
          paranormal for many years and has conducted several investigations
          alongside Zak. He is the author of three books, including
          <i>Title Shot</i>, and more than two hundred internet and print
          articles. Crigger retired from the US Army in 2011 after twenty-four
          years in uniform.
