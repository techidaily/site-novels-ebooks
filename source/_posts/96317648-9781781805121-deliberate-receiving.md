          is a hilarious, fun, but deeply practical guide for anyone who was
          inspired and excited by the promise of <i>The Secret</i>, but felt
          that it fell flat when it came to the actual details of how to
          manifest your desires in real life. <br /><br />Outrageously fun,
          infinitely logical and full of practical, applicable wisdom, Melody’s
          humorous, no-BS style is paired with an astounding ability to bring
          through higher guidance that will help you make seismic shifts in your
          understanding of what has been holding you back. <br /><br />This book
          guides you through a step-by-step approach to figuring out what you
          truly want, why you don’t have it yet and exactly what you need to do
          to get it. It will leave you uplifted and empowered to deliberately
          receive more abundance, fun and passion in your life.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Melody Fletcher empowers her readers to change their lives by
          reminding them that they are WAY more powerful than they've been led
          to believe, and that they do, indeed, create (and receive!) their own
          reality. Melody believes that pretty much everything most people have
          been taught about the world is bullshit, and she’s not afraid to say
          so! The way she works with her coaching clients is actually a form of
          channeling – but she doesn’t go into trance and there is no other
          entity speaking through her. She connects to her higher self to bring
          through wisdom that will help you shift at a breakneck speed – so if
          you’re ready for change then you had better fasten your seatbelt!
          Originally from the US, she has dual-citizenship in America and
          Germany – which she likes to think makes her kind of like a
          super-organized cheerleader. www.deliberatereceiving.com
