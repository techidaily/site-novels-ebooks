            Becoming the psychic detective of your own life can lead you to your
            deepest awakening. Release the idea that you are a victim of your
            life, and take back yourpower! Higher perspectives, healing from
            past wounds &amp; trauma, releasing karmic &amp; toxic cycles,
            opening up to soulmate love and true love (within and around), and
            stepping into your divine self-sovereignty are all available in this
            book. The author, Gia Khay, has reached a space of inner peace and
            tranquility- her spiritual path is authentic. Like many of us, she
            once felt lost in this world, disconnected from her truth and true
            self. But, now, she is fully connected to her Empress energy and
            soul...
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Gia is passionate about healing the inner child, the power of God
            &amp; Spirit, self-healing, overcoming blocks and internal
            resistance to self-evolution, and the existence of Twin Flames; an
            ideal love where two souls unite for a higher purpose. Many people
            have had a troublesome upbringing with some level of trauma,
            ignorance, fears and illusions conditioned into us. We have been
            molded and shaped to others' wills, spiritual beliefs &amp;
            practices are not yet totally accepted or implemented by society.
            We're still very much acting out from our wounded inner childs! It's
            time to release outdated and self-limiting systems and step into the
            unknown. In the darkness, there is light. You can break generational
            curses, ancestral and karmic negative cycles, and activate powerful
            self-healing mechanisms within. You are the healer and creator of
            your destiny!
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Once we awaken, we realize our soul chose exactly the quality of
            parents and family situations to incarnate into. Each time we dive
            into the unknown, into the grief and anguish of the human condition,
            into our childhood wounds and fears, we unlock ever greater
            spiritual and human passion, power, and unconditional love for all.
            There is no greater feeling than one of an epiphany, an aha moment,
            a sudden realization, and the feeling of comfort in our soul that
            happens when we shift to an expanded perspective about life and our
            own suffering.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This is a book about spiritual awakening, unifying with the
            collective consciousness energy field and Gaia. In this book, A Twin
            Flame Mystery, Gia shows readers how to connect with God, and with
            the source of your Higher Self.
