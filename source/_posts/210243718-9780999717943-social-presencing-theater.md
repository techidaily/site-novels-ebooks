            Social Presencing Theater: The Art of Making a True Move&nbsp;is a
            journey into the origins, principles, and practices of an innovative
            social art form co-created by Arawana Hayashi and colleagues at the
            Presencing Institute. This embodiment practice deepens reflection
            and supports individual, team, organizational, and social
            transformation. This highly accessible book offers an introduction
            to newcomers and provides a deeper understanding of the work for
            experienced practitioners who wish to create powerful spaces for
            heart-based learning and action. The book addresses the origins and
            underlying principles of Social Presencing Theater, while containing
            practice instructions and stories that highlight its uses in
            companies, schools, and social projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social Presencing Theater invites us to tap into our natural
            creativity and ability to fully embody the "performance" of being
            human. Hayashi's intention with this work is to offer movement
            practices that support people in recognizing their own and others'
            embodied wisdom, compassion, and courage to act. In the face of
            today's enormous environmental, social, and spiritual challenges, we
            can become disconnected from the fundamental human goodness that
            lives in our presence. Social Presencing Theater invites us to make
            the true moves that are ours to make to create a society of
            brilliance, warmth, and strength.

          "Arawana Hayashi is a master. She has invented a form whereby people
          learn to use their bodies to explore, individually and collectively,
          what the intellect can never fully grasp-the complex social structures
          we humans create and become stuck in. She has created a wonderful
          vehicle to guide the journey."
        </p>
        <p>
          -Peter Senge,&nbsp;MIT &amp; Center for Systems Awareness"Arawana's
          clear and lighthearted storytelling invites us into new ways of being
          together-she explores how we can collaborate beyond words, become more
          present and aware of the world around us, and sense into the emerging
          future."
        </p>
        <p>
          -Eileen Fisher,&nbsp;founder, EILEEN FISHER, Inc."This book takes you
          on a remarkable journey into uncovering the link between embodiment,
          awareness, and social systems. As Arawana describes her process using
          Social Presencing Theater, we experience how our own movements can be
          problematic, or hold the key to creativity and coherence of the
          whole."
        </p>
        <p>
          -Wendy Palmer,&nbsp;Leadership Embodiment"Making a True Move is an
          eloquent and inspiring affirmation of the power of art as spiritual
          practice and agent for social change. This profound and multi-layered
          book offers a balm for our turbulent world."
        </p>
        <p>
          -Meredith Monk,&nbsp;composer, performer, interdisciplinary
          artist"Making a True Move is a fierce and gentle contribution at a
          moment when we desperately need to reconnect with our own bodies and
          to make sense of the collective body, the human community. This book
          is both a treasure and a prayer."
        </p>
        <p>
          -Dr. Angel Acosta,&nbsp;Director of Fellowship, Garrison
          Institute"Throughout Arawana's graceful teachings are the qualities of
          inspiring, visioning, and guiding people through the movement of
          life-movement of learning, movement of change, movement of
          manifesting."
        </p>
        <p>
          - Larry Yang,&nbsp;author of Awakening Together: The Spiritual
          Practice of Inclusivity and Community
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is not easy to write about a lived, embodied experience; but
          Arawana's deep connection with spiritual roots and her long-standing
          dance practice enable her to share in a very expressive way the
          essentials of Social Presencing Theater."
        </p>
        <p>
          -Tho Havin,&nbsp;Director of the Gross National Happiness Centre in
          Bhutan"This outstanding and beautiful book presents Arawana's
          experiences and wisdom in an inspiring and uplifting way."
