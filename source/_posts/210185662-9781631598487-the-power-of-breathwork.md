            >Drawing on a multitude of breathing practices from different
            healing and spiritual traditions,
            <i>The Power of Breathwork</i> includes 25 simple exercises that you
            can practice alone or with a partner. </b
          ><br /><br />
          Knowing how to breathe and how to use your breath purposefully has
          been proven to reduce negative mental and physical issues and actually
          heal the body and mind. A regular home breathwork practice is
          <b>an affordable and easy way for you to engage in self-healing</b>
          practices that can have a profound impact on your overall health.
          <b>Harness the power of breathwork to:</b><br />
          &nbsp; Facilitate proper immune function Enhance connection,
          creativity, joy, and intuition Reduce physical pain as well as
          tension, depression, anxiety, and trauma <br />
          Author, practitioner, and grief worker Jennifer Patterson begins by
          explaining what breathwork is, why you should try it, and how it can
          be used to heal the bodymind. Then, you’ll learn
          <b
            >what happens in your physical body, energetic body, and emotional
            body</b
          >
          as you practice it. Before you start the exercises, find useful tips
          on building an altar, using scent, visualizations and grounding, and
          somatic writing prompts to help support your practice.<br /><br />
          After
          <b>achieving collaboration and deeper trust with your body</b> through
          practices such as a nurturing body scan and learning to catch and
          shift out of breath-holding patterns,
          <b>return to yourself with these solo breath patterns:</b> 4-7-8
          Breath, Energizing Breath, Box Breath, Pursed Lip Breath, Lion’s
          Breath, Diaphragm Breath, Alternate Nostril Breath, Skull Shining
          Breath, Ocean Breath, and Multi-Part Fast-Paced Breath.<br /><br /><b
            >With a partner, use breath to</b
          >
          work with witnessing and being witnessed, giving and receiving touch,
          and navigating conflict. Through these practices, you can
          <b>breathe into a deeper relationship</b> with another.<br /><br />
          For <b>more focused breathwork practice</b>, you will also find
          <b>exercises that work with themes</b> such as creativity, easing
          perfection narratives, inviting laughter and joy, cutting energetic
          ties to harmful dynamics, plus dedicated practices for welcoming the
          new day and then, when it is done, releasing the day and inviting
          sleep.<br /><br /><i>The Power of Breathwork</i> provides you with
          simple and approachable ways to intentionally and effectively breathe
          to bring healing and joy.
