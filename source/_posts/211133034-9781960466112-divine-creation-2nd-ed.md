            <strong>Divine Creation,</strong> is a unique spiritual guidance
            book, which provides its readers with information and insights that
            can change their lives. This book was transferred through
            channeling. In every aspect of life, the moment you begin to ask
            'why' and do not get any straight and logical answers, it is time to
            stop and rethink.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The book answers in simple and humorous language the question 'Who
            are we?', as well as other important questions, such as:
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          Who is God / The Creation, The Creators, and The Created?
          <p><br /></p>
          How was life and humanity on Earth created?
          <p><br /></p>
          Why we are here and what is the purpose of humanity in the universe?
          <p><br /></p>
          What is destiny, fate, and soul?
          <p><br /></p>
          What is heaven and hell, and is there life after death?
          <p><br /></p>
          What are the basic rules of the universe?
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Many basic, essential insights are presented in the book, such as:
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          There never was and never will be a single truth.
          <p><br /></p>
          You are all visitors for a brief moment on Earth.
          <p><br /></p>
          Nothing was nor ever will be yours forever, other than your freedom of
          choice.
          <p><br /></p>
          Even your soul is not yours.
          <p><br /></p>
          You cannot die.
          <p><br /></p>

          I would highly recommend this book to everyone. I enjoyed reading
          about the future. I like the idea of parenting licenses to be allowed
          to have children. If you take a life you pay with your own.
