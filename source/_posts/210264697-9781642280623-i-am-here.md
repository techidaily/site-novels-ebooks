            I Am Here is a book about the endurance of love and communication
            even after death. It is a story of loss, overwhelming grief, and
            finally healing, through small messages - or what I call postcards -
            from the other side.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            My daughter Suzanne and I were extremely close. We always had shared
            an interest in and an open heart to mysteries that we could not
            explain. With a belief in the afterlife, we made a pact to remain
            close to each other even after death. I thought I would make that
            journey first. I was wrong. Her loss at 39 was crushing.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            I explain how Suzanne kept our pact and remains with me from the
            other side. She has shown her presence in many ways, including
            showing both my husband and I unexplainable phenomena and giving us
            a talisman in the form of a found penny. Her small postcards have
            helped us heal and have given us so much joy. If your heart is open
            to finding your own postcards, you can heal and find happiness too.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            I discuss using mediums, dreams, and sitting with automatic writing.
            I use these things to communicate and encourage you to try the same
            if you wish to receive a message from a loved one on the other
            plane.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Grief is an awful thing. It robs you of life and joy. My last
            chapter deals with the darkness of grief and gives some suggestions
            about how to deal with that painful grey place to find peace, light,
            and to fully live your life again.

          "Through her experiences, readers receive keys on how to find,
          recognize, and use their own 'postcards' to develop a revised
          worldview and connections to spirit and deceased loved ones... [I Am
          Here] should be included on the reading lists of those recovering from
          grief." - <strong>Midwest Book Review</strong>

          "In her debut memoir, Togher presents wrenching and honest meditations
          on how to live after the passing of someone you love...Togher writes
          of her experience with courage and deep emotional intelligence. Her
          memoir reads as a therapeutic expression of her grief, a practical
          guide for readers seeking comfort after loss, and a celebration of
          Suzanne's life." - <strong>Publishers Weekly/BookLife</strong>
