          An esteemed scientist's personal journey from skepticism to wonder and
          awe provides astonishing answers to a timeless question: Is there life
          after death? <br />
          Are love and life eternal? This exciting account presents provocative
          evidence that could upset everything that science has ever taught.
          Daring to risk his worldwide academic reputation, Dr. Gary E.
          Schwartz, along with his research partner Dr. Linda Russek, asked some
          of the most prominent mediums in America -- including John Edward,
          Suzane Northrup, and George Anderson -- to become part of a series of
          extraordinary experiments to prove, or disprove, the existence of an
          afterlife. <br />
          <b>THE AFTERLIFE EXPERIMENTS</b> <br />
          This riveting narrative, with its electrifying transcripts, puts the
          reader on the scene of a breakthrough scientific achievement: contact
          with the beyond under controlled laboratory conditions. In stringently
          monitored experiments, leading mediums attempted to contact dead
          friends and relatives of "sitters" who were masked from view and never
          spoke, depriving the mediums of any cues. The messages that came
          through stunned sitters and researchers alike. <br />
          Here, as they unfolded in the laboratory setting, are uncanny
          revelations about a son's suicide, what a deceased father wanted to
          say about his last days in a coma, the transformation of a man's
          lifelong doubts about the afterlife, and, most amazing of all, a
          forecast of a beloved spouse's death. Dr. Schwartz was forced by the
          overwhelmingly positive data to abandon his skepticism, reaching some
          startling conclusions. <br />
          Compelling from the first page to the last,
          <i>The Afterlife Experiments</i> is the amazing documentation of
          groundbreaking experiments you will never forget.
