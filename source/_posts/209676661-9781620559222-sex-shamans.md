          20 transformative stories and sexual healing practices from
          international pioneers in the sexual shamanism movement <br /><br />•
          Reveals intimate details about how each sex shaman overcame personal
          struggles with heartache, jealousy, mental illness, or social shame to
          realize their calling as a sacred sexual healer <br /><br />• Includes
          20 in-depth embodiment exercises such as soul gazing, contacting your
          spirit guides, sexual divination, energetic sex, self-pleasuring, moon
          blood rituals, and sacred sexual storytelling <br /><br />• Includes
          contributions from 20 diverse voices in the sexual shamanism
          community, all part of the mystery school ISTA: International School
          of Temple Arts <br /><br />Drawing on traditional and modern
          practices, a sex shaman uses the power of erotic energy as a healing
          medicine. They channel divine love and embrace sexuality freely,
          practicing polyamory, sexual healing, and even sex magic. They teach
          tantra, trance dance, kundalini yoga, and other techniques for healing
          shame, guilt, fear, and sexual trauma. <br /><br />Designed to guide
          the reader on a journey into their own sacred sexual awakening, this
          book shares true stories from 20 visionary pioneers in the sexual
          shamanism movement, all of them associated with the International
          School of Temple Arts (ISTA), a mystery school that works to
          illuminate the path of sexual shamanism and heal the split between sex
          and spirit, release the shame surrounding sexual awakening, and
          inspire more sexual liberation around the world. The teachers reveal
          intimate details of their life stories and sexual awakening journeys,
          showing how, by surrendering to the wisdom of the erotic current of
          the universe, transformation occurs. <br /><br />Each story is
          accompanied by an in-depth embodiment exercise with step-by-step
          instructions, including soul gazing, contacting your spirit guides,
          sexual divination, energetic sex, self-pleasuring, moon blood rituals,
          and sacred sexual storytelling. Underlying these exercises is the
          belief that the body is a temple that opens with pleasurable worship
          so spirit may dwell more fully within. <br /><br />The 20 contributors
          include Baba Dez Nichols, Bruce Lyon, Crystal Dawn Morris, Dawn
          Cherie, Deborah Taj Anapol, Ellie Wilde, Janine Ma-Ree, KamalaDevi
          McClure, Komala Lyra, Laurie Handlers, Lin Holmquist, Matooka
          Moonbear, Mia Mor, Ohad Pele Ezrahi, Patrik Olterman, Raffaello
          Manacorda, Ria Bloom, Sean O’Faolain, Stephanie Phillips, and Stephen
          SouLove.
