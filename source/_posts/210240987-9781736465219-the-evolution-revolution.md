            Take a journey that will open your eyes, your mind, your
            Heart.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Take a journey that will #UpliftandInspire.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Take a journey that will create insight and encouragement.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In simple, relatable language-more wham/bam/thank-you-ma'am and less
            blah, blah, blah-Sahara speaks of the human condition at the
            crossroads of a new way of being in the world: a way of being that
            honors the essence of what we are and propels us toward the next
            stage of evolution as a species.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            She encourages us to recognize that we are individual cells in the
            body of humanity, that we have not just the opportunity-but the
            responsibility-to change the world by changing ourselves,
            and&nbsp;<strong>shows us how in simple, practical steps.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Sahara tells us that enlightenment Is not complicated, or even
            mystical-it's simply choosing to shift one's attention (and change
            one's behavior) in a way that enables one's own Higher Self to be
            more present in the body, and an awakened state of Consciousness to
            arise.

          <p>Excerpt:</p>
          <p>Are You Ready?&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            What if I told you that racial equality depends on you loving
            yourself unconditionally?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Or that the end of war depends on discovering your True
            Identity?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            What if I told you that an unpolluted ocean requires you to let go
            of an old grudge?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Or that the end of homelessness depends on you taking out your
            earbuds, disconnecting from your device, and smiling at everyone you
            pass on the street?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            What if, by recognizing that we are One-and understanding that we
            are collectively responsible for all the good and all the ills we
            see in the world-we each began to take personal responsibility for
            how that is?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And what if we understood that it all begins and ends with
            Love?&nbsp;
