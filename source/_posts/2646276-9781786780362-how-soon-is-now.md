          We are on the brink of an ecological mega-crisis threatening the
          future of life on earth and our actions over the next few years may
          well determine the destiny of our descendants. Between a manifesto and
          a tactical plan of action,&nbsp;<i>How Soon is Now?</i>&nbsp;by
          radical futurist and philosopher Daniel Pinchbeck outlines a vision
          for a mass social movement that will address this crisis.<br /><br />Drawing
          on a huge range of resources and references Daniel Pinchbeck presents
          a compelling argument for the need for change on a global basis – it
          is only when we see ourselves as one planetary tribe that this change
          can occur. The central thesis is that humanity has self-willed the
          ecological crisis in order to bring about the necessary conditions for
          transcendence of our current state of being, by undergoing an
          initiatory ordeal on a planetary scale. <br /><br />This collective
          ordeal is necessary for us to evolve from one state of being – our
          current level of consciousness – to the next. By passing through this
          initiation we realize ourselves as one unified being, a planetary
          super-organism in a symbiotic relationship with the Earth's ecology
          and the entire web of life. Covering everything from energy and
          agriculture, to culture, politics, media and ideology, Pinchbeck's
          book is ultimately about the nature of the human soul and the future
          of our current world. He calls for an intentional and consciously
          designed metamorphosis of our current systems, which transform
          capitalist and exclusive structures into participatory, democratic,
          and inclusive ones, based on an integration of Eastern metaphysics,
          social ecology, and radical political thought. "<i>How Soon is Now?</i
          >&nbsp;gives us the context we need to understand the chaos and
          turbulence of our times." – Sting

          'It speaks to something I often say our culture sorely lacks: Rites of
          passage.' -&nbsp;Neil Strauss<br /><br />‘How Soon is Now?&nbsp;gives
          us the context we need to understand the chaos and turbulence of our
          times.’ – Sting<br /><br />'A blueprint for the future' -&nbsp;Russell
          Brand <b><br /></b><br />'Daniel Pinchbeck's
          <i>HOW SOON IS NOW?</i> is a powerful exploration of our need for a
          massive upgrade of collective consciousness if we are to address the
          inconsistencies and pathologies that afflict the modern world. While
          we have seen massive progress, we have also seen moral failures... and
          our unwillingness to question preexisting dogma might cost us
          dearly.&nbsp; Daniel's book offers a startling call to action!'
          -&nbsp;Jason Silva, artist, filmmaker and futurist<br /><br />
          ‘Here we are, humanity, caught in the moment between devolution and
          conscious evolution by choice, not chance. Daniel Pinchbeck's new book
          takes us to this exact inflection point and reveals&nbsp;in remarkable
          clarity and brilliance, We Do Know What To Do, in almost every field
          from spiritual to social to environmental innovations arising
          everywhere.’&nbsp; – Barbara Marx Hubbard, author, Conscious
          Evolution<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          ‘Daniel Pinchbeck has emerged as a rational and clear voice of hope
          for a new post-capitalist future, offering alternatives to hack
          democracy for a better society.’ – Jefferson Hack, CEO and Founder,
          Dazed &amp; Confused<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          ‘I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to make sense of
          climate change within a bigger picture that includes the evolution of
          civilization and consciousness.’ – Charles Eisenstein, author, Sacred
          Economics <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          ‘How Soon Is Now offers a spiritually driven approach to global
          economic and ecological crisis… With dangerous and admirable honesty,
          Pinchbeck tests his deepest held assumptions and judges his life
          choices in a crucible of self-doubt. It's at once an initiation for
          himself, and an invitation for us to ask these same sorts of questions
          of ourselves as individuals and a society.’ – Doug Rushkoff, author,
          Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus<br /><br />'Provides deep insight
          into the essential issues of our time ... could spark the revolution
          of consciousness that is the revolution not just of thinking, but of
          acting.’&nbsp;- Ervin Laszlo, Bestselling Author and Philosopher<br /><br />'Daniel
          Pinchbeck’s life is the hero’s journey. Like Homer’s Odyssey, How Soon
          Is Now is a song of redemption for a world torn apart by the monsters
          of our own creation. We’ve dreamed a world that is consuming itself
          into extinction. Pinchbeck offers us a new dream and in doing so takes
          us on a powerful, magical voyage into balance and sanity.' - John
          Perkins, <i>New York Times</i> Bestselling Author of
          <i>Confessions of an Economic Hitman</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />'With
          his new work Daniel Pinchbeck is proposing systemic solutions to the
          ecological crisis looming over us, requiring a drastic shift in
          lifestyle and new levels of global cooperation. Whether or not you
          agree with all of his conclusions, <i>How Soon Is Now?</i> will
          challenge most conventionally held assumptions about the global
          environment.' - Moby
