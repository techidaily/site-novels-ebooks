          <i>The Ayahuasca Test Pilots Handbook</i> provides a practical guide
          to ayahuasca use, aiding seekers in making right—and safe—decisions
          about where to go, who to drink with, and what to expect.<br /><br />
          Ayahuasca, the Amazonian psychoactive plant brew, has become vastly
          popular. Once the sole purview of shamans and indigenous native people
          in the great Amazon rainforest, ayahuasca is now becoming well
          known—and widely used—around the globe. Today, foreigners from all
          over the world flock in ever-burgeoning numbers to the steamy Amazon,
          drinking bitter ayahuasca with shamans and curanderos in order to
          access its potent healing and spirit-enlivening effects. What began as
          a mere trickle of visitors in the 1980s has become a surging riptide
          of seekers.<br /><br />
          Chris Kilham (Fox News's "Medicine Hunter") has worked closely with
          South American shamans for two decades and has sat in ayahuasca
          ceremonies with at least 20 different shamans. Through his "Ayahuasca
          Test Pilots" program, Kilham has brought numerous people to the Amazon
          to engage in ceremonies with maestro ayahuasceros. Clear, concise,
          straightforward, and well informed,
          <i>The Ayahuasca Test Pilots Handbook</i> is an indispensable guide
          for anyone curious about this unusual plant medicine.

          “Ayahuasca is the vision vine, the plant of the gods,&nbsp;the most
          powerful tool in the repertoire of the shaman of the Northwest Amazon.
          More and more people from all corners of the world are discovering its
          wonder. It's not a simple thing, and certainly not for the
          fainthearted; taking ayahuasca is a chance to tear open the placenta
          of ordinary reality and emerge transformed. This is a book that can
          help you on the journey."&nbsp;<br />—Wade Davis, author of
          <i>One River</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "In the engaging style that those familiar with Chris Kilham's work
          have come to know and love, the Medicine Hunter provides a dense but
          entertaining overview of the magic Amazonian brew ayahuasca. He
          discusses the history, botany, chemistry, pharmacology and
          ethnographic context of ayahuasca, and and, true to the spirit of the
          title, gives readers an informative 'flight manual' describing the
          physical and psychological effects of the brew. Kilham also describes
          the dimensions and entities ayahuasca voyagers can expect to encounter
          in their shamanic explorations and provides a few pointers on how to
          keep their spirit ship sailing smoothly.
          <i>The Ayahuasca Test Pilots Handbook</i> is an excellent introduction
          for those new to the ayahuasca experience and a solid reference for
          grizzled veterans. Highly recommended!"<br />—Dennis McKenna, author
          of <i>Brotherhood of the Screaming Abyss</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Chris Kilham writes convincingly and eloquently about some of his—and
          my—favorite medicinal plants from the Amazonian rainforest, my ‘second
          home’ for nearly twenty-five years. Like Chris, I have a great respect
          for the ayuahuasca, <i>the</i> entheogen.”<br />—Dr. Jim Duke, author
          of <i>Herbistatins</i> and <i>The Green Pharmacy</i><br /><br />"Chris
          Kilham continues to shine the light on nature’s medicines. In this
          book, he has provided the ayahuasca traveler with an essential and
          practical guide that is well-informed, personal, and fun. I highly
          recommend this book to those who want to learn from the wisdom of the
          plants.”<br />—Joe Tafur, MD<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “People testing ayahuasca will gain much from reading this book before
          take-off. Chris Kilham knows his plants, his writing is fun, and the
          book itself is packed with knowledge.”<br />—Jeremy Narby, author of
          <i>The Cosmic Serpent</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “A worthy primer for anyone interested in learning about ayahuasca.
          Well researched, well written, on target. Chris Kilham has added
          another important book to the ayahuasca bookshelf.”<br />—Peter
          Gorman, author of
          <i>Ayahuasca in My Blood—25 Years of Medicine Dreaming</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "Chris Kilham is one of the world’s leading advocates of the medicinal
          use of traditional Amazonian ayahuasca. This book unveils the
          mysteries surrounding Ayahuasca and provides a strong foundation for
          anyone interested in journeying to the Amazon to participate in these
          extraordinary ceremonies or understanding the emerging Western
          fascination with visionary plant medicine.”<br />—Hamilton Souther,
          master Ayahuasca shaman and founder of Blue Morpho Tours<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "When I first moved to New York City I bought a copy of that famous
          black subway guidebook, and I carried it everywhere for my first six
          months in the city. Chris Kilham has created the equivalent for the
          equally vast cosmic landscape of ayahuasca shamanism. From lodge and
          shaman reports to the history of South American shamanism, and
          including veteran tips for navigating both terrestrial and celestial
          Amazonian terrains, this one-of-a-kind guidebook is a must-read for
          all spiritual seekers who are being called to work with or learn more
          about the ayahuasca tradition."<br />—Adam Elenbaas, author of
          <i>Fishers of Men: The Gospel of an Ayahuasca Vision Quest</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “I can’t imagine that anyone besides Chris Kilham could write the
          definitive guide to using ayahuasca. In this book, Chris shares his
          vast knowledge base and experience with <i>la medicina</i> in a way
          that’s informative, entertaining, and enlightening. When it comes to
          explaining this ancient, powerful medicine to Westerners, Chris is the
          man!”—Robyn Griggs Lawrence, natural-living advocate and former editor
          of <i>Natural Home</i> magazine<br /><br />
          “In his latest book, Chris Kilham provides fascinating and engaging
          context on the traditional utilization of one of the New World’s most
          powerful plants, Ayahuasca, bringing the reader on an ethnobotanical
          journey of learning about the past and present use of this sacred
          Amazonian vine.” <br />—Michael J. Balick, author of
          <i>Rodale’s 21st Century Herbal</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Chris Kilham is a brilliant adventure storyteller with the gift of
          gab, and he shares fringe explorations, intense inspirations,
          wild-ride revelations, and intimate healings that will make you feel
          like laughing, crying, nodding, twisting your head, and marveling at
          the vast mystery that is spirit.” <br />—Zoe Helene, founder of Cosmic
          Sister<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "Kilham writes clearly and compellingly on a complicated topic. Some
          will appreciate the history, context, and chemistry of
          <i>la medicina, </i>while all of us who love healing plants will
          delight in this literary immersion into a sacred journey.&nbsp;Reading
          this handbook triggered belly laughs of recognition and body memories
          of spirit flights with trusted shamans such as those this primer
          describes." <br />—Amanda McQuade Crawford, MA, Dip. Phyto., RH (AHG),
          MNZAMH, MCPP<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Chris Kilham takes us on an easy-to-read journey into the Amazonian
          world of ayahuasca, eloquently covering the history, science, and
          experience of the visionary and healing jungle brew that the Western
          world is only now discovering.”<br />—Chris Bennett, author of
          <i>Cannabis and the Soma Solution</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Kilham is the best person today to authentically tell the ayahuasca
          story because he embodies all things necessary to take us on that
          journey: he is a botanist, a widely recognized plant-medicine
          explorer, a close friend of tribal peoples, a historian, a
          storyteller, and one who has had a great many journeys with the
          medicine. With a brilliant, open mind and endless spiritual energy,
          Chris has pulled together the knowledge and stories of ayahuasca in a
          way that will help guide anyone into and through the wonder of it.”
          <br />—Linda Sparrow, author, filmmaker, and natural-products
          marketer<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “All You’ve Ever Wanted to Know about Ayahuasca but Didn’t Know What
          or Whom to Ask: Chris Kilham, aptly named the Medicine Hunter, is the
          ultimate storyteller: wise, funny, articulate, and wonderfully
          charming, in the best possible sense. He takes us on a magical journey
          spanning all aspects of the ayahuasca experience—the plant, the people
          involved (shamans and participants), the outer journey, the inner
          journey, and how to navigate the intricacies of it all. His kindness,
          warmth and spirit shine throughout. You can’t help loving this
          book—and its most captivating author.” <br />—Hyla Cass, MD,
          psychiatrist, author of <i>8 Weeks to Vibrant Health<br /></i><br />
          “Written from personal experience and in his typical delightful
          storytelling style, Chris Kilham’s
          <i
            >The Ayahuasca Test Pilot’s Handbook: The Essential Guide&nbsp;to
            Ayahuasca Journeying</i
          >
          is just that. The use of hallucinogenic substances for this type of
          journeying or healing requires cultural guides. Chris provides a
          bridge from the ancient to the modern, interweaving the culturally
          shamanic understanding of the experience with that of the modern
          seeker. It is a delightful read for those interested in the
          psycho-spiritual use of plants and truly is a guide for those seeking
          the experience.”<br />—Roy Upton, RH, DipAyu, Executive Director,
          American Herbal Pharmacopoeia<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “I have known Chris Kilham for nearly forty years, and it was my good
          fortune to be part of a small group that went with Chris to drink La
          Medicina and be in&nbsp;ceremonies with several wonderful shamans. In
          this book, Chris Kilham has proven himself to be the foremost
          messenger of the plants. The images are accurate and the experiences
          he shares are heartfelt, humorous, and savvy. Any attempt to educate
          and inform about natural products and their value, and about the
          importance of the indigenous cultures from which they come, pales when
          compared to one simple lecture from Chris Kilham.”<br />—Andy Levine,
          author and founder of Yellow Emperor Herbs<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "There is a pandemic of suffering from psycho-spiritual illnesses that
          modern healthcare is not able to address. An ever-increasing number of
          people&nbsp;yearn&nbsp;for ‘something more’ in life. In answer,
          ayahuasca is reaching out across the globe to offer its significant
          benefits. But with the substantial growth in interest in the medicine,
          there is more and more need to foster an educated, reverent, and
          cautious approach to drinking ayahuasca.
          <i>The Ayahuasca Test Pilots Handbook</i> is a candid and at times
          humorous book packed with important information to help
          people&nbsp;consciously&nbsp;navigate their way into and through their
          first experiences with ayahuasca. I highly recommend this book as a
          valuable resource for people interested in beginning a path of healing
          and self-discovery with ayahuasca.”<br />—Matthew Watherston, founder
          of Temple of the Way of Light<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Most experts would agree that for psychedelic plant adventures, a
          good guide is essential, and a great guide can make this journey truly
          life-altering. In <i>The Ayahuasca Test Pilot’s Handbook, </i>Chris
          Kilham becomes our great guide in understanding the phenomena of
          ayahuasca, informing and enlightening us on this most personal of
          plant journeys. Kilham covers the requisite basics of any thorough
          plant investigation, but also skillfully and reverently handles the
          concept of communication with ‘plant spirit’ and describes in
          detail—and with open-minded humor—the wide range of experiences a
          human can have on the ayahuasca journey. If this is your next plant
          adventure, don't 'leave home' without this helpful and all-inclusive
          guide.”<br />—Lynda LeMole, consultant to herbal businesses; former
          president of Traditional Medicinals<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "Chris Kilham has written a true handbook for anyone interested in
          Ayahuasca. If you are brand new to ayahuasca and searching for real
          information into this interesting plant medicine, then this book is
          the ideal place to go. If you have partaken in ayahuasca ceremonies in
          the past, you’ll find clear details that may help you better explain
          and understand what you experienced but had never found the right
          words to share with others."<br />—Malcolm Rossiter, shaman at Blue
          Morpho<br /><br />"Finally, a well-researched and well-written book on
          that most powerful of all Amazonian plants!&nbsp;The best book on
