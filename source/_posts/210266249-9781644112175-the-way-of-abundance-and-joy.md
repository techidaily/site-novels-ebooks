          • Shows how to relate to and receive help from the elements, reconnect
          with nature to access abundance and joy, connect with plants, animals,
          water, air, and fire <br /><br />• Explores don Alberto’s upbringing
          in a family of <i>yachaks</i>, his initiation, and his personal work
          to fulfill the Andean prophecy of the Eagle and the Condor
          <br /><br />• Includes reflections and essays from several of don
          Alberto’s students and others who have worked with him, including
          Itzhak Beery and John Perkins <br /><br />Recognized as a master
          <i>yachak</i>, don Alberto Taxo was a celebrated spiritual elder,
          shaman, and healer of the pre-Inca Atik (Kichwa) people from the Andes
          Mountains of Ecuador. He shared ancient Andean shamanic wisdom and
          practices in the United States for more than 20 years--his personal
          quest to fulfill the Andean prophecy that the Eagle and the Condor
          will fly together in the same sky in harmony. <br /><br />Written with
          don Alberto’s permission and as further fulfillment of the
          Eagle-Condor prophecy, this book shares don Alberto’s teachings and
          his simple approaches for building a reciprocal relationship with
          nature, centered on <i>Sumak Kausay</i>, the way of joy and abundance.
          As a yachak, a shaman of the elements, don Alberto showed how to
          relate to and receive help from nature. When we are connected with
          nature on an emotional and spiritual level it creates joy that is
          deeply healing and can be accessed during life’s difficulties. The
          book discusses traditional Ecuadorian shamanic beliefs and practices,
          including Andean Inca cosmology; how to connect with plants, animals,
          air, fire, and water in sacred springs, the ocean, or your shower; and
          Inca concepts like Pacha, the space-time era in which we live that is
          now transitioning to a new one of connection and love after 500 years.
          <br /><br />The book explores don Alberto’s upbringing in a family of
          yachaks, his initiation, and his assumption of the role of shaman for
          his community. It also includes reflections and essays from don
          Alberto’s students and others who have worked with him, including
          shamanic teachers Itzhak Beery and John Perkins, showing how he
          influenced their lives and awakened them to the path of
          <i>Sumak Kausay</i>, Abundant Life.

          “In this era of ecological crisis, the human spirit cries out for
          teachings and practices that can restore balance between our species
          and the rest of God’s creation. Drawing from a range of
          genres--interviews, personal reflection, and stories--Shirley Blancke
          conveys the wisdom of don Alberto Taxo, a revered shaman and spiritual
          teacher from Ecuador, whose insights can awaken humanity to the
          interconnection of all beings and our responsibility to live more
          gently on Earth. His heart-centered perspectives will resonate with
          people of all faith traditions who seek healing for our planet.”
