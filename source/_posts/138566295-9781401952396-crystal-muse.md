          "My connection with crystals began on a journey to a red rock on a
          spiritual vortex in Sedona, AZ. I now have a crystal altar in my home
          and place them around my yoga mat during practice. Each crystal is a
          gift of patience and self-love. In a chaotic time,
          <i>Crystal Muse</i> shares how connecting to the calm, grounding
          energy of crystals can help us engage with each other and
          ourselves."<br />— <b>Lena Dunham</b>, actress, writer, and

          energy to shift my mindset . . . so I’m prepared for whatever my day
          throws at me (even with the chaos that comes with being a supermomma
          of three!)."<br />— <b>Molly Sims</b>, mom, actress, and author<br /><br />"A
          must-read for any crystal curious soul to a fully-fledged gemstone
          junkie. Pages full of practical rituals, easy-to-read crystal
          meanings, and how-tos make this book my new crystal go-to."— Emma
