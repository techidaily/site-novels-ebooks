            >This elegant, concise guide by the founder of the University of
            Philosophical Research distills a lifetime of spiritual seeking into
            one beautiful, unforgettable blueprint for inner growth.&nbsp; </b
          ><br /><br />"When you grow exhausted with all of today’s spiritual
          programs, axioms, seminars, and techniques; when you feel fatigued
          from searching and cannot find a way forward; when it seems that years
          of seeking have netted so little – throw yourself upon the essential
          truths in this book…It can be lifesaving." --Mitch Horowitz, from the
          introduction<br /><br />For more than a half-century, Obadiah Harris
          has studied the spiritual path, holding ministerial pulpits in
          traditions ranging from Pentecostalism to New Thought, and directing
          programs in continuing education, community-outreach, and
          distance-learning at major universities.<br /><br />He has worked with
          the ideas and legacies of spiritual icons ranging from Manly P. Hall,
          author of the landmark <i>The Secret Teachings of All Ages</i>, to<b
          ></b>Ernest Holmes, founder of the Science of Mind movement, America's
          most successful and intellectually rigorous New Thought congregation.
          When he was growing up in rural Oklahoma, Harris's family provided the
          first pulpit to internationally known televangelist Oral Roberts.<br /><br />As
          a scholar and seeker, Harris has traversed and helped shape broad
          swaths of our modern spiritual landscape. Now, he distills the
          insights he has found -- all of them potent, powerful, and, above all,
          <i>useful</i> -- in <i>The Simple Road. </i><br /><br /><i
            >The Simple Road</i
          >
          is more than a book. This concise statement is a spiritual GPS that
          guides the earnest seeker past dead-ends and switchbacks to locate the
          path that most intimately and directly connect us with the Source of
          all life. The methods and ideas in this book can help rescue you from
          a crisis and provide a daily source of practice.&nbsp;<br /><br />This
          brave work addresses head-on topics that are often shunned or ignored
          in works of "proper" theology, including the question of physical
          healing by spiritual means -- a topic treated with deepest seriousness
          -- and with the existence of hostile forces that test us on the
          spiritual path.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>The Simple Road</i> is balm for
          parched souls. Whatever tradition you belong to, or if you belong to
          no one tradition, <i>The Simple Road</i> helps you locate the thread
          of universality that runs through all faiths, and leads you to
          practices, prayers, methods, and parables that lift your daily journey
          to a higher, better place.<br /><br />This brief, powerful book can
          bring you literally life-saving solace when facing life's
          entanglements.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Obadiah Harris</b> is the founder and president of the University
          of Philosophical Research (www.UPRS.edu), an accredited
          distance-learning college that grants graduate and undergraduate
          degrees in consciousness studies, transformational psychology, and
          liberal arts. The school is built upon the intellectual traditions of
          independent scholar of religion Manly P. Hall (1901-1990), who founded
          its landmark Los Angeles campus, the Philosophical Research Society.
          &nbsp;Also president of the Philosophical Research Society, Harris has
          a long and storied career in both mainstream academia and the American
          metaphysical culture. &nbsp;He holds a Ph.D. in education
          administration and supervision from the University of Michigan and an
          MA in education from Arizona State University, where he was an
          associate professor of education and director of community education.
          For almost two decades at Arizona State he designed programs in
          community outreach and in adult and continuing education. Harris has
          held numerous ministerial pulpits and collaborated with figures of
          major influence in contemporary spirituality, including Ernest Holmes
          (1887-1960). Born in northeastern Oklahoma, he lives in Los Angeles.
