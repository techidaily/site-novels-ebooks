            >An arcane ritual reveals a code hidden within Thelema’s most holy
            book.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Over a period of several years, the former head of Kenneth Grant’s
          Typhonian Order in the United States, conducted a bizarre sexual
          ritual with elements of Thelema, Lovecraft, and the Egyptian
          mummification ceremony to unlock a mathematical code buried in plain
          sight in Aleister Crowley’s <i>Book of the Law</i>.<br /><br />
          Jeffrey Evans, a follower of Aleister Crowley’s Thelema since his
          teenage years, had an encounter on a bridge in Washington, DC, with a
          being he identified as his holy guardian angel. This
          being—Karla—provided him with the inspiration to begin a series of
          rituals incorporating Egyptian and Lovecraftian elements in an effort
          to traverse the Tunnels of Set: pathways on the “dark side” of the
          Qabalistic Tree of Life. The ritual, conducted with his wife, Ruth
          Keenan, employed cross-dressing and bondage as well as Cthulhian
          imagery and chanting, and resulted in a series of revelations
          concerning the mathematical code hidden within the verses of Crowley’s
          <i>Book of the Law</i>: a circumstance that Crowley always suspected
          but was never able to prove, not even with the help of accomplished
          mathematicians. Evans tried in vain to demonstrate this code to other
          members of the Typhonian Order, to no avail, but a chance meeting
          online with Peter Levenda resulted in Levenda’s taking a closer look
          at the data and what he discovered astounded him. He agreed to help
          bring this discovery to the attention of the general public.<br /><br />
          There has been very little new work published in the field of Thelema
          in the last 10 years or so, at least since the death of Kenneth Grant.
          Most publishing concerning Crowley has been biographical or reissues
          of Crowley’s own material. This work is a departure from all of that.
          It is new material, completely unexpected within the
          Crowley/Thelema/OTO environment, for it offers a new approach to the
          mathematical nature of Thelema that so far has been based on Qabalah.
          This work brings attention to the existence of a sacred geometry
          within the verses of the <i>Book of the Law</i>: a completely
          unexpected discovery but nonetheless mathematically verifiable. It
          bridges the gap between Thelema, Freemasonry, and Templarism, as well
          as Gnosticism, demonstrating a continuum of esoteric thought spanning
          millennia.
