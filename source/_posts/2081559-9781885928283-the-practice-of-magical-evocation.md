          Throughout the ages, and primarily during the past few centuries, many
          lengthy dissertations have been published on the art of higher magic.
          Unfortunately, they are for the most part such bewildering and
          incomplete remnants that very little of it can be taken as a point of
          reference for practical studies, and this only in small fragments. The
          original initiative for magic was known only to a very few lodges and
          was reserved for a particularly chosen few, while for the seekers of
          truth who searched diligently for any information, this subject matter
          remained dark and mysterious. Various religions during the Middle Ages
          were severely hostile towards any magical knowledge. In our history,
          the most prominent examples are the well known Inquisitions. Later, in
          modern times, magic was regarded as mere superstition, and any person
          who showed some inclination toward this knowledge, let alone one
          seriously concerned himself with the study of magic, was regarded as a
          fool and was ridiculed. In the past, mystical and other sects maligned
          magic to such a degree that the word “magic” has to this very day an
          extremely dubious reputation. And any person who has had an
          appreciation or understanding for magical knowledge has been pilloried
          as a black magician. In reality, true magic was initially taught in
          the ancient schools of the prophets, and then only in the highest
          circles. However, only a few select insiders had access to these
          institutions. In those days, only a few books occasionally disclosed
          scant bits of information about true magic. These books were
          deliberately written in such a way that they would disclose little or
          nothing even to the most astute reader, and hence they would not give
          the seeker of truth a complete understanding of the subject of magic.
          In accordance with the ancient Egyptian Mysteries, the magic of the
          second Tarot card is represented by the High Priestess. Franz Bardon,
          the author of The Practice of Magical Evocation, gladly continues to
          guide the serious, diligent reader and student of magic along the
          proper path, as long as this person is devoid of any fanatical
          religious beliefs and erroneous ideology. Furthermore, this person has
          to be prepared to penetrate further into the mysteries of the
          knowledge of magic or the Hermetic sciences. As in Franz Bardon’s
          first book, Initiation into Hermetics, Bardon endeavors to keep the
          language of this second volume in a style that is understandable to
          everyone. The subject matter of the magic of evocation is among the
          least known and least investigated branches of the art, and therefore
          Bardon makes certain that every person who reads this book will become
          completely familiar with this subject matter, not only in theory but
          above all with the practice, if he so chooses. It is important,
          however, that the reader know that he will not achieve any results
          with the practice of magical evocation unless he has successfully
          completed Step VIII, at the very least, of Franz Bardon’s first book,
          Initiation into Hermetics, which is a description of the first tarot
          card, the Magician. Should Franz Bardon be successful in assisting the
          reader who has successfully completed the entire practical part of his
          first book to achieve the same good results with this one, then Bardon
          has achieved his objective. Those readers who initially study the
          secret sciences only theoretically will find in this work a
          satisfactory broadening of their knowledge.
