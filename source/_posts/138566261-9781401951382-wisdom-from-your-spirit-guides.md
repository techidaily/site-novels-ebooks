          Your Spirit Guides Are Waiting to Talk to You!<br /><br />Whether you
          realize it or not, you’re in constant contact with your spirit guides.
          Your spirit guides, a team of energetic beings, are ever-present
          spiritual teachers offering guidance, support, wisdom, and love.<br /><br />In
          this book, world-renowned spiritual medium James Van Praagh shares the
          benefits and rewards of having a conscious relationship with your
          guides. You’ll explore the many different guides you can encounter
          over the course of your life and lifetimes, including earth guides who
          have physical bodies and those who reside in the Spirit realm. Since
          our soul’s energy is constantly changing, our guides, too, are
          changing, making for a rich and infinite array of possibilities.<br /><br />You
          will also discover where the guides come from and what they are here
          to do. James offers insights from the guides that deal with common
          situations, and shows you how to make contact with your own inner
          guides and protect yourself from unwanted energies. The book features
          a series of powerful energy-raising exercises and meditations to
          enrich your journey to understanding your guides and the assistance
          they can impart on your life. In doing so, you’ll learn how to work
          with your chakra points, increase your heart space, and ground
          yourself to receive messages from your guides.<br /><br /><i
            >“From the moment we take our first breath, our unseen support team
            is always nearby to assist and take care of us. Even in the most
            desperate of moments, we are never alone. There are many beings
            encouraging you to rise up and believe in yourself, or to find an
            aspect of yourself that you have forgotten which can strengthen your
            resolve.”</i
