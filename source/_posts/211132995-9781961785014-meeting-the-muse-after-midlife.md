          <p>EMBRACING A MORE CREATIVE PATH AFTER MIDLIFE</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Many of us reach midlife without a roadmap for making meaning in the
            years ahead. As Sally Jean Fox turned 50, she heard a voice that
            said, "There's more." Guided by the presence of a Muse, Sally
            embarked upon the quest of a lifetime as she explored and
            experimented with a new path of creative expression. In the process,
            she found joy in a range of art forms from gardening and clowning to
            singing, painting, and writing-all while learning to fill her life
            with more beauty, reverence, and wonder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sally does not sugarcoat the hardships that can come with the
            progression of years, yet she finds aging to be her ally as she
            makes peace with her old self-judgment demons and learns to trust
            her inner wisdom. While sharing the truths she discovers about the
            second half of life, Sally celebrates the freedoms, joy, and growth
            life after 50 can offer. "Our bodies will decline with age," she
            writes, "but if we feed our souls, our spirits will be able to
            soar."

          "This book is like a masterclass in empowerment. Cleverly disguised as
          a memoir, this is a captivating exploration of aging and creativity."

          "Let Sally Jean Fox be your wise and funny guide on the path to
          becoming a passionate elder. Her memoir is a paean to vulnerability,
          creativity and love, and how to remain fully human as time brings
          inevitable changes. Beautifully done."

          "Sally Fox's spiritual memoir, Meeting the Muse After Midlife, is both
          intensely personal and archetypal in its vivid depiction of the
          journey to awakening. Aging, Sally shows us, is not the diminishment
          we are led to believe, but rather, the opportunity to embrace all of
          life as a thing of beauty."

          "Sally does an incredible job of conveying the emotions and
          reflections many of us feel as we move into the third chapter of life.
          With a powerful, authentic voice, she shares the contradictions,
          hopes, and joys that come with life after 50, offering the possibility
          that life becomes richer when we see it in terms of 'both/and.'"

        <p>
          We each possess a creative spirit, but few of us recognize it, and
          even fewer&nbsp;still live in ways to give it wings-especially after
          midlife. Sally Fox's wise, funny book,&nbsp;Meeting the Muse After
          Midlife,&nbsp;shows us by example that aging is less about cognitive
          decline than about creative incline, if not creative flight. It's
          never too late to find your way.

        <p>
          "Sally Jean Fox is an inspiring storyteller, demonstrating how humor,
          joy, and creative expression are everyone's birthright, inspiring the
          voice of Truth within. Meeting the Muse After Midlife transforms our
          way of life from an acquiescent, linear struggle, into a multifaceted
          experience. Empowered by faith, courage and compassion, she calls us
          to live a life of true purpose, passion and possibility, beyond the
          myths of retirement and ageism."
