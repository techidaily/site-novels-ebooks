          Explains how self-organizing systems, from crystals to human
          societies, share collective memories that influence their form and
          behavior <br />
          <br />• Includes new evidence and research in support of the theory of
          morphic resonance <br />
          <br />• Explores the major role that morphic resonance plays not just
          in animal instincts and cultural inheritance but also in the larger
          process of evolution <br />
          <br />• Shows that nature is not ruled by fixed laws but by habits and
          collective memories <br />
          <br />In this fully revised and updated edition of
          <i>The Presence of the Past</i>, Cambridge biologist Rupert Sheldrake
          lays out new evidence and research in support of his controversial
          theory of morphic resonance and explores its far-reaching implications
          in the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, and
          sociology. <br />
          <br />His theory proposes that all self-organizing systems, from
          crystals to human society, inherit a collective memory that influences
          their form and behavior. This collective memory works through morphic
          fields, which organize the bodies of plants and animals, coordinate
          the activities of brains, and underlie conscious mental activity.
          Sheldrake shows how all human beings draw upon and contribute to a
          collective human memory and that even our individual recollections
          depend on morphic resonance rather than physical storage in the brain.
          He explores the major role that morphic resonance plays not just in
          animal instincts and cultural inheritance, such as religion and
          ritual, but also in the larger process of evolution, which Sheldrake
          shows to be more an interplay of habit and creativity than a mere
          “survival of the fittest.” <br />
          <br />Offering a replacement for the outdated, mechanistic worldview
          that has dominated biology since the nineteenth century, Sheldrake’s
          new understanding of life, matter, and mind shows that rather than
          being ruled by fixed laws, nature is essentially habitual. And because
          memory is inherent in nature, he explains, in order to survive
          successfully for generations to come, we will have to give up our old
          habits of thought and adopt new ones: habits that are better adapted
          to life in a world living in the presence of the past--as well as the
          presence of the future.
