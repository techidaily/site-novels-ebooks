          A scientific investigation of the healing and energetic effects of
          crop circles<br /><br />• Shares the results of decades of research
          into crop circles, including detailed scientific explanations and
          responses from an 800-person questionnaire study <br /><br />•
          Explores the connections between crop circle formations, cosmic
          energies, and consciousness <br /><br />• Features stunning,
          full-color aerial photographs of crop circles from Lucy Pringle’s
          personal collection <br /><br />In 1990 while studying the energetics
          of a crop circle, Lucy Pringle experienced a miraculous healing of a
          severe shoulder injury. Inspired, she expanded her research to
          investigate the physical, psychological, and energetic effects of
          these mysterious formations on people as well as on animals. In this
          book, alongside her stunning full-color aerial photographs of crop
          circles, Pringle shares the results of her research, including
          anecdotes from an 800-person questionnaire study, in combination with
          detailed scientific explanations by aerospace engineer and fellow crop
          circle researcher James Lyons. <br /><br />The authors discuss case
          histories of healing, from temporary respite from arthritis,
          Reynaud’s, and Parkinson’s, to the permanent cure of muscle strains
          and chronic pain, to emotional healing and feelings of peace and
          happiness. They explore the relationship of crop circle formations and
          consciousness, highlighting “intention” as a key factor in crop circle
          manifestation. Pringle describes the wide range of physiological
          effects--both positive and negative--caused by the frequencies in crop
          circles and shows how the negative symptoms may possibly be caused by
          heavy use of pesticides. <br /><br />Drawing on the science behind the
          formation of the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, the authors
          explain how the same electromagnetic waves that produce these lights
          in the sky also interact with the Earth’s magnetic field and ley lines
          to produce geometric-energetic patterns in fields--crop circles--akin
          to the cymatic patterns of sand on a vibrating drum surface. They
          reveal dowsing as a way to identify underlying sacred geometry within
          a field and explain how healing arises as the result of communication
          with the self-organizing energy field of a crop circle.
          <br /><br />With the first recorded appearance of a crop circle
          formation more than 4,000 years ago, crop circles are an ancient part
          of Earth’s and humanity’s intertwined history that we are only
          beginning to understand.

          “Not only is this a fascinating and entertaining book, but it is truly
          mind-expanding. The materialist paradigm, which permeates the science
          of today, finds us lacking in the conceptual equipment required to
          cope with the crop circle phenomenon. The accounts of people’s
          experiences, reactions by animals, strange and meaningful
          synchronicities, and not least so many inexplicable facts on the
          ground, baffle the way of thinking that most of us have grown up with.
          It’s no wonder why crop circles aren’t featured in the mainstream
          media much--those writing about them don’t know what to say! James
          Lyons’s comments are of great value. As he points out, earlier
          civilizations, and even tribal people today, have a conceptual map
          which can include such phenomena. His interpretation of crop circle
          geometry in relation to music is of special value. This book should be
          widely read, especially by scientists.”
