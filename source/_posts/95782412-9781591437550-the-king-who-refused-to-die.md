          Zecharia Sitchin’s secret allegorical novel that brings to life the
          key concepts of his bestselling book <i>The 12th Planet</i> <br />
          <br />• Reimagines the Epic of Gilgamesh in the context of Sitchin’s
          discoveries <br />
          <br />• Details ancient Sumerian sex rituals, the Anunnaki lineage of
          the gods who lived in Sumer, Anunnaki spacecraft technology, the
          workings of the Oracle of Anu, and Gilgamesh’s relationship with the
          goddess Ishtar <br />
          <br />Written in secret so as not to incite criticism about his
          controversial discoveries, this novel from the late Zecharia Sitchin
          brings to life the key themes of his bestseller
          <i>The 12th Planet</i>. The story begins in London as Astra arrives at
          the British Museum’s opening for their new Gilgamesh exhibit. There
          she meets a handsome stranger who knows secrets about her that no
          stranger should know, including the source of the unusual scar on her
          hand. Taking her to his apartment, he reveals that she is descended
          from the goddess Ishtar and that he is the modern-day avatar of
          Gilgamesh seeking to claim the eternal life Ishtar denied him so long
          ago. Reenacting their sacred sex ritual from eons ago, they find
          themselves transported to ancient Sumer as Gilgamesh and Ishtar, where
          he is at last able to continue his quest for immortality. <br />
          <br />But as Gilgamesh fulfills his sacred duties with Ishtar,
          something goes awry and the Oracle of Anu will not renew its blessing
          upon his kingship. Following the direction of his mother, the Anunnaki
          goddess Ninsun--the source of his partial divinity--Gilgamesh flees
          the city for the Anunnaki forbidden zone in search of a way to the
          planet Nibiru and eternal life. Travel alongside Gilgamesh and his
          immortal companion Enkidu as they escape the fate pronounced by the
          oracle, discover a Tablet of Destiny meant for Ishtar, fight off
          Marduk’s raiders, and foil the plot of the high priest, Gilgamesh’s
          half-brother who is seeking Gilgamesh’s crown for himself. <br />
          <br />Retelling the Epic of Gilgamesh in the context of his
          discoveries about the Anunnaki, Zecharia Sitchin weaves a tale of
          ancient ceremony, accidental betrayal, gods among men, interplanetary
          travel, and a quest for immortality spanning millennia.

          "In Mr. Sitchin’s [work], evolution and creationism collide. He has
          spent his life arguing that people evolved with a little genetic
          intervention from ancient astronauts who came to Earth . . . He has
          studied ancient Hebrew, Akkadian and Sumerian, the language of the
          ancient Mesopotamians, who brought you geometry, astronomy, the
          chariot, and the lunar calendar. And in the etchings of Sumerian
          pre-cuneiform script--the oldest example of writing--are stories of
          creation and the cosmos that Mr. Sitchin takes literally."

        </h4>
        <p>
          One of the few scholars able to read and interpret ancient Sumerian
          and Akkadian clay tablets, Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) based his
          bestselling <i>The 12th Planet</i> on texts from the ancient
          civilizations of the Near East. Drawing both widespread interest and
          criticism, his controversial theories on the Anunnaki origins of
          humanity have been translated into more than 20 languages and featured
          on radio and television programs around the world.
