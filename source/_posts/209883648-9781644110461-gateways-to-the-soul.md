          A guide on how to live more soulfully and, in so doing, transform
          yourself and the planet <br /><br />• Explores the connections between
          healing your personal wounds and healing the planet <br /><br />•
          Explains how embracing unitive qualities such as love, friendship,
          joy, courage, forgiveness, and truth, as well as facing your Shadow
          sides and confronting world evil, enables you to move through
          important gateways leading to soul <br /><br />• Offers a variety of
          transpersonal exercises, meditations, and guided visualizations
          <br /><br />Humanity is in a great crisis of soul today, but there is
          also much good will around. As a species, we are challenged to start
          embracing a new story, one that enables us to be less greedy and
          materialistic and to espouse peace not war, kindness not cruelty, and
          heart as opposed to indifference. What we need is to bring more soul
          into the world. <br /><br />In this guide about engaging in inner work
          to bring change into the world, Dr. Serge Beddington-Behrens reveals
          how the healing of our personal wounds combined with the growing of
          our soul life leads us directly to the addressing of world problems.
          Sharing inspirational stories from his own personal journey of
          becoming a transpersonal psychotherapist, shaman, and activist, he
          shows you how, by transforming your inner world, you begin creating
          important positive ripples that reverberate around all areas of your
          outer one. <br /><br />The exercises and meditations he has devised
          will not only help you heal and become more fully human but also
          enable you to bring a very different kind of awareness--a sacred
          awareness--into all areas of your everyday life. Not only will this
          enable you to experience more joy and meaning as you increasingly
          disconnect from the clutches of the system, but you will also find
          yourself opening your heart, reclaiming your personal power, bringing
          in new myths for humanity to live by, and gradually shifting away from
          being part of the problems in the world to becoming a core part of
          their solution.
