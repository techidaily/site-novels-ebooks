            >Kahlil Gibran’s masterpiece, <i>The Prophet,</i> is one of the most
            beloved classics of our time—a&nbsp;collection of poetic essays that
            are philosophical, spiritual, and, above all,
            inspirational.&nbsp;Published in 1923, it has been translated into
            more than twenty languages.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>The Prophet</i> contains powerful words of wisdom on
          such essential subjects as marriage, children, friendship, work, and
          pleasure—words that readers from around the world have found
          inspirational and life-changing. A poet, artist, and mystic, Gibran
          was born to a poor Christian family in Lebanon and emigrated to the
          United States as an adolescent, where he began studying art. The
          twenty-eight poetic essays collected in <i>The Prophet</i> are
          illustrated with twelve of his full-page drawings. Perhaps no other
          twentieth-century writer has touched the hearts and minds of so
          remarkably varied and widespread a readership.

          "Cadenced and vibrant with feeling, the words of Kahlil Gibran bring
          to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes... If there is a man
          or woman who can read this book without a quiet acceptance of a great
          man's philosophy and a singing in the heart as of music born within,
          that man or woman is indeed dead to life and truth." --<i

        </h4>
        <p>
          Kahlil Gibran (1883-1931), poet, philosopher, and artist, was born in
          Lebanon, a land that has produced many prophets. The millions of
          Arabic-speaking peoples familiar with his writings in that language
          consider him the genius of his age. But he was a man whose fame and
          influence spread far beyond the Near East. His poetry has been
          translated into more than twenty languages. His drawings and paintings
          have been exhibited in the great capitals of the world and compared by
          Auguste Rodin to the work of William Blake. In the United States,
          which he made his home during the last twenty years of his life, he
          began to write in English. <i>The Prophet</i> and his other books of
          poetry, illustrated with his mystical drawings, are known and loved by
          innumerable American who find in them an expression of the deepest
          impulses of man’s heart and mind.
