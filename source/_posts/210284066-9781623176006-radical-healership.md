            >The countercultural healer’s guide for building a sustainable and
            values-driven practice: work toward your purpose, grow your client
            base, and thrive with integrity in an unjust capitalist system. The
            time for healing—and the time to <i>be</i> a healer—is now.</b
          ><br /><br />Therapist Laura Mae Northrup navigates the complexities
          of being a healer today—and shows how you can stay true to your
          calling in a world built from systems that were designed to extract,
          oppress, and exploit.<br /><br />Addressing fundamental tensions that
          arise for practicing healers working in a late-stage capitalist
          culture, Northrup shares how to:<br />&nbsp;<br />Maintain your
          ethical framework even while prioritizing financial
          stability&nbsp;Market and brand your practice authentically, without
          resorting to fear-based tacticsRecognize the unconscious biases and
          unexamined motivations you unintentionally bring to workHonor your
          limits within a culture that valorizes overwork and perpetuates
          burnoutPrioritize your emotional needs and spiritual goals—and honor
          their place in your healing practice&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Structured in
          accessible, to-the-point chapters with practical writing and
          reflection prompts, Northrup offers an authentic, spiritually grounded
          approach to healership, going much deeper than the promise of a
          million-dollar practice or a minimum-effort game plan.<br /><br />Written
          for healers of all modalities—including radical therapists, functional
          practitioners, reiki workers, bodyworkers, and healers who have been
          sidelined, underfunded, underresearched, or delegitimized within a
          Western capitalist framework—this book offers a nuanced, political,
          and social-justice informed guide to building the practice you
          want—and thriving as the healer you were born to be.

          "<i>Radical Healership</i> is the book that astrologers, tarot
          readers, counselors, and other healing practitioners need. It gives
          you good advice from an experienced healer … about what it means to
          heal as a job without wanting to make it a job. It is a book that
          embraces you."<br />—ALICE SPARKLY KAT, author of
          <i>Postcolonial Astrology</i><br /><br />"Northrup shows you how to
          take care of your financial, spiritual, and emotional needs as you
          stay true to your radical values. Get ready to feel as if you’re in a
          deep conversation with a wise mentor who always tells you the
          truth."&nbsp;<br />—ANNIE SCHUESSLER, host of the podcast
          <i>Rebel Therapist</i><br /><br />"If you’re looking for an
          anti-oppressive, anti-capitalist, spiritually led book to help you
          start or build your healing arts practice, start right here."&nbsp;<br />—JENNIFER
          PATTERSON, author of
          <i>The Power of Breathwork<br /><br /></i>"Northrup brings humanity to
          the experience of being a healer. This is a&nbsp;must-read for all
          health professionals, nurses, caregivers, artists, lovers, mystics—and
          anyone looking to find their footing in this world.”<br />—ALESE
          OSBORN, tarot reader, Oracular artist, and host of the podcast
          <i>Neon Cauldron</i><br /><br />"This is the book I wish I had as a
          new practitioner." <br />—CHASE DESSO, acupuncturist<br /><br />"Reading
          this book feels like being welcomed into a growing web of creative
          practitioners who are bravely shaping the future of our healing
          professions in a direction that we desperately need."&nbsp;<br />—SASCHA
          ALTMAN DUBRUL, MSW, counselor, cofounder of The Icarus Project, and
          author of <i>Maps to the Other Side<br /></i><br />"[Northrup's]
          personal stories serve as examples of the courageous
          self-understanding that are the essential foundation of our work."
          <br />—LAURA LAMB BROWN-LAVOIE, poet, herbalist, and doula<br /><br />"...
          this book can help any practitioner—from the newbie to the
          long-established healer—create vision and coherence in their life’s
          work." <br />—ANNA HOWLAND, psychotherapist<br /><br />"If I’d had
          this [book] available to me when I started, ... I would’ve made the
          same progress in five months that wound up taking me five years."
          <br />—CHAIKUNI WITAN, Shipibo Medicine Practitioner<i><br /><br /></i
          >"Finally, a deeply thoughtful book that addresses the complex
          ethical, political, and spiritual dimensions of building a sustainable
          practice amidst late-stage capitalism and dire environmental
          reckoning."&nbsp;<br />—PHILLIPPE CITRINE, MFT, Generative Somatics
          Coach, founder of the Peacock Course private practice training for
          trans, queer, and social justice healers<br /><br />"Northrup’s voice
          ... is unflinchingly REAL—intersectionally attuned, purposefully
          confessional, often gloriously blunt, and intentional—with clear
          frameworks for healing. This a self-help book for the helpers."<br />—JOHN
          MINK, social studies teacher and editor of Teaching Resistance<br /><br />"Northrup’s
          personal stories, professional anecdotes, radical know-how, and
          fiercely compassionate outlook inspired me to see and nurture parts of
          myself that are critical to my healing practice." <br />—LEIA
          FRIEDWOMAN, MS, Psychedelic Integration Facilitator and host of the

        </h4>
        <p>
          Laura Mae Northrup, MFT, is a practicing psychotherapist and educator
          based in Oakland, CA. She is the creator and host of the podcast
          <i>Inside Eyes</i>, a series that explores the use of entheogens and
          psychedelics to heal sexual trauma. Her work focuses on defining
          sexual violence through a spiritual and politicized lens, mentoring
          healing practitioners in creating a meaningful path, and supporting
          the spiritual integrity of our collective humanity.
          <i>Radical Healership</i> is her first book. You can find more
