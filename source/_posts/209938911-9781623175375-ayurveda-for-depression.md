          <b>An integrative approach to support your health and well-being</b
          ><br /><br />While Western medicine often relies on a
          one-size-size-fits-all approach to treating depression, Ayurveda
          offers an individualized, holistic model that draws upon five thousand
          years of scientific knowledge and practice to address depression
          systemically--restoring balance and nourishing mind, body, and spirit.
          <br /><br />The Ayurvedic anti-depression protocols outlined in this
          book can work alone or in concert with conventional therapies to help
          you develop a tailored plan that meets your unique needs. You'll learn
          how to identify your inborn and mental constitutions (<i>prakruti</i>
          and <i>manas prakruti</i>) to better understand the root causes of
          your condition. This book will empower you to create daily and
          seasonal routines using dietary adjustments, mind-body training, and
          herbal remedies to reawaken your body and cultivate the wisdom needed
          to heal from depression.

          PRAISE FOR <i>AYURVEDA FOR DEPRESSION<br /><br /></i>"It is a pleasure
          to write about <i>Ayurveda for Depression</i> and Dr. Eduardo
          Cardona-Sanclemente. His scientific and medical training combined with
          his Ayurveda knowledge enable him to apply his research to one of the
          paramount conditions of our time with a keen eye guided by deep human
          understanding. This is a significant contribution to the bridging of
          Western and Eastern medicine."<br />—PROF SIR SALVADOR MONCADA, FRS,
          FMedSci, HonFBPhS, Manchester Cancer Research Centre, Universityof
          Manchester<br /><br />"Dr. Eduardo Cardona-Sanclemente has produced an
          excellent, detailed, and many-sided account of the Ayurvedic treatment
          of depression with reference to modern medicine as well. An important
          contribution in the field of Ayurvedic studies that is worthy of deep
          examination."<br />—DR. DAVID FRAWLEY, author of
          <i>Yoga and Ayurveda<br /><br /></i>"What a beautiful book that
          elegantly integrates the modern biomedical understanding of depression
          with the wellness and healing of Ayurveda. Dr. Cardona-Sanclemente
          invites the reader into his personal story and offers wellness and
          healing strategies that restore balance and health using an
          individualized Ayurvedic approach to diet, lifestyle, herbs, and the
          emotions. <i>Ayurveda for Depression</i> provides an insightful and
          novel approach for those suffering from depression that is
          compassionate and achievable."<br />—DIANA I. LURIE, PhD, professor of
          Neuropharmacology at the University of Montana and certified Ayurvedic
          practitioner<br /><br />"The darkness of depression is a reality for
          many, and this book is a welcome guide to how Ayurveda can shine a
          light on this condition and how to dispel the disabling shadow that it
          casts."<br />—DR. ROBERT SVOBODA, BAMS (Ayurvedacharya), author of
          <i>Prakriti: Your Ayurvedic Constitution</i><br /><br />"This is the
          book that anyone struggling with depression must read."<br />—MATTHEW
          MCKAY, PhD, professor at The Wright Institute and coauthor of
          <i>Thoughts &amp; Feelings<br /></i><br />"Dr. Cardona-Sanclemente
          speaks to us heart to heart, helping us synthesize much information
          into personal understanding and providing tools for devising a
          personal plan toward wellness. I believe this authoritative
          exploration can touch and benefit many."<br />—CLAUDIA WELCH, DOM,
          author of
          <i>Balance Your Hormones, Balance Your Life<br /><br /></i>"Way beyond
          depression, the essential principles of Ayurveda expressed in this
          book will be helpful to anyone interested in this remarkable
          traditional way toward human healthy balance. Dr. Cardona-Sanclemente
          sees with his heart and radiates that through his unique perspective
          on science, health, and humanity."<br />—ALEXANDER DE SALZMANN, MD,
          Internal Medicine, Paris France<i><br /><br /></i>"Sometimes one
          encounters a colleague with unique insights and sensitivity who takes
          a refreshingly forensic view of what we have come to accept as norms.
          Dr. Cardona-Sanclemente is such a colleague. I know from decades of
          professional collaboration that this book will be of great support to
          those experiencing depression and other mental health conditions.”<br />—DR.

          Medical Research (INSERM), France
