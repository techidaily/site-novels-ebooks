            This is a hardrback reprint edition of S.L. MacGregor Mathers’ The
            Key of Solomon the King first published in 1888. It contains the
            original text, all 91 illustrations, and over 80 footnotes composed
            by Mathers, which detail his original research and translation of
            ancient manuscripts located in British Museums. Also provided by
            Mathers is the Order of the Pentacles of Solomon, the Ancient
            Fragment of the Key of Solomon, The Qabalistic Invocation of
            Solomon, and 15 plates full of figures, seals and charts to aid the
            reader in their work. Beware of other editions that do not contain
            all of the original material, as the the book is rendered useless
            without them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work is traditionally divided into two books detailing the Key
            of King Solomon. Book One explains the operation of conjurations,
            curses, spells and other magical works. Book Two instructs the
            practitioner on the proper attire, purification rituals and other
            means of obtaining the goals of the Goetia. Between these two books
            is the list of plates that contain numerous illustrations and secret
            seals of Solomon, including the Mystical Seal of Solomon, the
            Pentacles of Solomon, and the Mystical Alphabet, which impart the
            mechanisms and requirements for the invocation of spirits and demons
            and other magical works or spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes referred to as the Greater Key of Solomon, this work
            should not be confused with the Lesser Key of Solomon or Clavicula
            Salomonis Regis, or Lemegeton, which is based on similar source
            material and was also researched by S. L. MacGregor Mathers with the
            aid of Aleister Crowley. It is thought that The Greater Key of
            Solomon later inspired The Lesser Key as a derivative work: one with
            its own substantial value through the addition of various
            illustrations and guides such as the Magic Circle of Solomon, the 72
            Seals of Solomon or King Solomon Seals, and the Pentagram of
            Solomon. But, although both grimoires are inspired by the same
            material, they are separate and distinct works.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note the Solomon Key is not any one particular
            book. The material has been collected in various forms and published
            by many authors, including Armand Delatte, and L. W. de Laurence.
            The earliest versions of the text can be found in ancient
            manuscripts in different languages all dating from the 16th century
            or later and spread across the globe in various libraries or private
            collections. For example, a Hebrew edition survives in the British
            Library, while a Latin version is kept at the University of
            Wisconsin. Various French editions as well as English translations
            are located throughout the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the mythical history of the document, King Solomon
            wrote the book for his son Rehoboam and commanded him to hide the
            book in his sepulchre upon his death. After many years, the book was
            discovered by a group of Babylonian philosophers repairing Solomon's
            tomb. None could interpret the text until one of them, Iohé Grevis,
            suggested that they should entreat the Lord for understanding. The
            Angel of the Lord appeared to him and extracted a promise that he
            would keep the text hidden from the unworthy and the wicked, after
            which he was able to read it plainly. Iohé Grevis then placed a
            conjuration on the book preventing the unworthy, unwise, and godless
            from attaining the desired effect of its practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scholars however believe the work and its many iterations derive
            from the ancient practices of Jewish Kabbalah and Arab Alchemy.
            After time, it is thought Greek and Roman influences were added
            until, finally, the work was used and molded by high Renaissance
            magicians. This book, as well as other King Solomon books, such as
            the Magical Treatise of King Solomon and the Testament of Solomon,
            were brought back to modern times through the labors of occult
            practitioners such as S. L. MacGregor Mathers and others around the
            turn of the last century.
