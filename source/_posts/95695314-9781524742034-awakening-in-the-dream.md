            ><i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author David Wilcock's
            latest captivating work of nonfiction, exploring new hidden truths
            about extraterrestrials, dreams, sacred science, channeling your
            Higher Self, and Ascension</b
          ><br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          What happens when a UFO researcher suddenly comes into telepathic
          contact with the very beings he has been so avidly studying, after
          years of increasingly provocative dreams? What happens when these
          telepathic "readings" begin predicting the future with astonishing
          precision—and speaking about an incredible upcoming event in which all
          life in our solar system will undergo a spontaneous
          transfiguration?<br /><br />
          David Wilcock is a master at weaving together cutting-edge alternative
          science, shocking insider information, and his own personal
          experiences to reveal stunning truths about humanity, positive and
          negative extraterrestrials, lost civilizations, and the universe we
          share. In&nbsp;<i>Awakening in the Dream</i>, David once again
          combines his extensive research, the <i>Law of One</i> series, new
          insider revelations, and his own connection with the divine to bring
          humanity closer to full disclosure than ever before—as well as to help
          us activate our full potential on the eve of Ascension.<br /><br />
          A&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author, TV personality,
          filmmaker, lecturer, and consciousness expert, David is the perfect
          person to guide us through the hidden realities of our world. With its
          myriad information, anecdotes, "big picture" comparative analysis with
          over six hundred references, and trustworthy messages channeled
          directly from the highest-level angelic sources, including a
          remarkable set of future prophecies built into the Great Pyramid
          itself,&nbsp;<i>Awakening in the Dream&nbsp;</i>promises to be his
          most astounding book yet.

          <b>Praise for&nbsp;David Wilcock and his books<br /></b><br />“Alien
          enthusiasts who love corroborating proofs will find the large amount
          of new detail satisfying, and those who find Wilcock personally
          compelling will love the juicy details of his youth.”—<i
            >Publishers Weekly </i
          >on<i> The Ascension Mysteries</i><br /><br />“Wilcock also makes an
          intriguing case for the energetic influences of the celestial bodies
          on the recurring...currents of history, and the mechanisms through
          which they may be directing them. At the very least, this book
          provides much food for thought. At its best, it is fuel for wonder and
          awe.”—<i>New Consciousness Review</i><br /><br />“David Wilcock is a
          leading thinker who makes a magnificent case...that a Golden Age is
          indeed within our grasp and can be brought into manifestation if only
          we choose to make it so.”—Graham Hancock, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Fingerprints of the Gods<br /></i
          ><br />“We are&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>alone in this universe. And we
          have David Wilcock to prove it—and to guide us to this golden
          prophecy.”—James V. Hart<br /><br />“A narrative as fast-paced and
          scintillating as a sci-fi novel.”—<i>Kirkus Reviews&nbsp;</i
          ><br /><br />“David Wilcock is a dedicated and passionate investigator
          determined to understand this chapter in our collective history.”—<i
            >New Dawn Magazine<br /></i
          ><br />“Read this book.”—<i>Omega New Age Directory<br /></i>
