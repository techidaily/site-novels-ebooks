          the Universe is calling you to align your life to a higher energetic

          new edition focuses Kyle’s teachings into 77 essential healing
          practices, sharing inspiring affirmations, channeled wisdom, and
          energetic messages to help you awaken your divine connection and
          activate your light. You’ll discover how to:<br /><br />·<b>

          ><br /><b>· Attract positive experiences into your everyday life</b
          ><br /><br />“Raising your vibration is all about choosing to be that
          good vibe wherever you go. Essentially, it’s about making the
          conscious choice to be the good you were born to be.<br /><br />"The
          high-vibe life is a good life. That doesn’t mean that everything’s
          going to be rosy, but it does mean that you have tools and practices
          that you can use when you need them.<br /><br />"That’s what I’ve
          learned about raising your vibration—it’s not about avoiding life’s
          challenges or high-vibing your way out of being human, it’s about
          being able to come back to your center more quickly when things get
          gnarly, challenging, or even dark.<br /><br />"My prayer is that no
          matter what comes up in your life, this book will support you in
          tapping into the resources you have within and returning to the
          highest vibration.”<br /><br />Love,<br />Kyle Gray<br /><br /><i
            >Raise Your Vibration</i
          >
          will help you lead a high-vibe life with purpose and love, so that you
          make room for an endless flow of miracles, guidance, and spiritual
          support in every area of your life!
