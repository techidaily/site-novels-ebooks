            Now in paperback, the droll memoir by a world-class physicist that
            includes recollections of his involvement with pioneering laser
            research, encounters with many of the most recognizable literary,
            cultural, and entertainment figures of the 20th century, and his
            role in teaching ESP techniques to the CIA--a real-life X-Files
            saga.

            Russll Targ is a Zelig-like character. His story is an idiosyncratic
            journey through the highways and byways of American intellectual,
            scientific, and cultural life in 20th century. His father (the
            long-time editor-in-chief at Putnam) acquired The Godfather on the
            basis of an outline scribbled on the back of a napkin. His mother
            was the first press agent of the fan dancer Sally Rand. His
            step-mother is the legendary literary agent Rosalind Targ. He was
            married for thirty years to the sister of the infamous chess master
            Bobby Fischer. He briefly dated Henny Youngman’s cousin. He attended
            college with Alan Alda’s wife, Arlene. He was part of Ayn Rand’s
            study group in the 1950s--along with economist Alan Greenspan. He
            was a pioneer in laser research. He spent many years developing
            air-borne laser wind sensors for Lockheed and NASA. He co-founded
            the Stanford Research Institute remote viewing program--which was
            funded by the CIA--and was instrumental in tracking Soviet and
            Chinese weapon installations during the Cold War. And, he is a
            legally blind motorcyclist—who happens to be a Buddhist.

            This is a fascinating memoir by a first-class intellect; the story
            of a physicist who has pushed the boundaries of siceince to explory
            the realms of parapsychology, spirituality, and the unexplained.

          "Russell Targ is a pioneer, a character trait he has demonstrated in
          fields as diverse as laser physics, parapsychology, and windshear
          physics. It is the essence of his nature. Thus, it is not surprising
          that he has led a fascinating life, and his biography takes the reader
          on a wonderful tale of discovery. If you have an interest in how the
          new comes into being, <i>Do You See What I See?</i> will reward you
          bountifully with the kind of stories that bring science to life and
          show it as the extraordinary adventure those who live it know it to
          be." --Stephan A. Schwartz, author of <i>Opening to the Infinite</i>
