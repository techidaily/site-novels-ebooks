            >From covering the front lines of the Gulf War to investigating
            Colombian drug lords to living with freedom fighters in the
            mountains of Afghanistan, war correspondent Brad Willis was
            accustomed to risk. But when mortal danger came, it was from an
            unexpected direction.</b
          ><br /><br />At the pinnacle of his career, a broken back and failed
          surgery left Willis permanently disabled and condemned to life in a
          body brace. Then came a diagnosis of terminal, stage IV throat
          cancer.<br /><br />At his 50th birthday party, friends gathered around
          Willis, who was crippled, almost mute, depressed, strung out on
          narcotic medications, and dying. Halfway through the celebration
          Willis realized the party's true purpose—his friends were there to say
          goodbye.<br /><br />Everyone knew Willis was on his way out...everyone
          except his 2-year-old son, who urged, “Get up, Daddy!"<br /><br />His
          son's words ringing in his ears, Willis chose to abandon Western
          medicine and embrace the most esoteric practices of Yoga to heal his
          body, mind, and soul—ridding himself of cancer and fully restoring his
          back. As a symbol of his journey, he took the spiritual name Bhava
          Ram, which stands for “Living from the Heart."<br /><br /><i
            >Warrior Pose</i
          >
          is an adventure chronicling some of the most momentous events of our
          time through a journalist's eyes, an unforgettable story about the
          power of love between father and son, and a transformational journey
          of self-healing, inner peace, and wholeness.
