            <b>Quick, easy emotional detoxes for whatever life throws at you!</b
            ><br /><br />Feeling uninspired on a (every?) Monday morning?
            <i>Cleanse it.</i> Fuming after an argument...two days later?
            <i>Cleanse it.</i> Exhausted by drama at the office?<i>
              Cleanse it.</i
            ><br /><br />Author Sherianna Boyle’s simple cleanse system will
            help you process difficult and overwhelming emotions, no matter what
            they may be. <i>Emotional Detox Now </i>gives you the tools to take
            on whatever life throws your way. Covering over 135 different
            emotions and situations, from decision making and disappointment to
            homesickness and heartbreak, the book includes a cleanse for every
            situation and scenario.<br /><br />It takes only a few minutes to
            move through the cleanse process, but you will find that the
            practice transforms your attitude. By checking in with your body and
            allowing your emotions to fully manifest instead of brushing them
            aside, you will be able to process what you are feeling and step
            back into your life refreshed and empowered to confront whatever
            challenge you may be facing.

          and implement right away! This method is sure to become an essential
          tool in your toolbox for health and wellbeing. I'm thrilled this
          material is being made widely available for practical emotional
          healing for all."<br />—Kris Ferraro, healer, coach, and Amazon
