          Inspired by the breakthrough channeled series
          <i>The Law of One,</i> Buddhist teacher Barbara Brodksy sent its
          author, Carla L. Rueckert, some transcriptions of her own material.
          Struck by Brodsky’s lucid, witty, and fearless channeling, Rueckert
          invited Brodsky to co-channel a conversation between their spirit
          teachers, Q’uo and Aaron. Developed from the transcripts of nine
          weekends of joint channeling,
          <i

            Spiritual Guides</i
          >
          offers teachings from a “positive polarity” perspective, and provides
          answers to a wide range of spiritual questions, such as:<br /><br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;“What is the spiritual path and how do we live it?”<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;“Why do seemingly bad things happen to people who are trying to
          follow the dictates of love?”<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“How do we open
          the heart?”<br /><br />Offering wise solutions to the major problems
          that prevent people from living with more awareness and compassion,
          these conversations offer the spiritual seeker a valuable template for
          a life of spiritual peace.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Barbara Brodsky is
          a nationally known Buddhist teacher and the founder of Deep Spring
          Center. www.deepspring.org. <br /><br />Carla L. Rueckert is best
          known for her channeling of <i>The Law of One,</i> also called

          “I appreciate true wisdom whatever the source. These conversations

          wisdom and compassion—to the central issues facing everyone who wants

          “These dialogues are like being in a cozy living room with
          grandparents who only have your deepest interests at heart. Deeply
          loving, wise, respectful, and funny, what they share is not only
          pertinent and intimate but evolutionary.”<br />
          —Ajahn Thanasanti Bhikkuni, Buddhist nun, teacher, and founder of
          Awakeningtruth.org<br /><br />
          “I absolutely love these teachings. They are a gift from Spirit filled
          with wisdom, love, and practical guidance for the seeker on his or her
          spiritual path. Every time I picked this book up, it spoke to my
          heart. It was a challenge to put it down.”<br />
          —John Orr, senior dharma teacher at New Hope Sangha<br /><br />
          “<i>The Aaron/Q’uo Dialogues</i> is a veritable compendium of
          spiritual wisdom, presented in clearly understandable human
          explanations, which lead the reader to a greater knowing of the true
          human yet divine Being.”<br />

          light, so we may thereby heal and awaken ourselves further. I'm
          pleased to recommend it to all who truly love, love, and truly love
          truth. As you know, the time is now.”<br />

          is for any new age collection strong in channeled works or Buddhism,
          and is inspired by the channeled series <i>The Law of One</i>. It
          represents a channeled collaboration between Barbara Brodsky and Carla
          L. Rueckert, who each channel spirit teachers, Q'uo and Aaron, and
          comes from transcripts of nine weekends of joint channeling. From
          reflections identifying the 'spiritual path' and how to live it to
          wise insights on contemporary problems that keep people from awareness
          and an enlightened lifestyle, this provides powerful advice and
          spiritual insights and is a pick for any new age collection,
