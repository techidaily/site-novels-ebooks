          • Explains how each of the 12 signs of the zodiac has 30 degrees, and
          each degree, like every star, is the center of a whole system of
          meanings <br /><br />• Provides detailed write-ups for each of the 360
          degrees of the zodiac <br /><br />• Details how to use the degrees for
          personal chart interpretation and as an oracle for guidance and
          inspiration <br /><br />In this extraordinary synthesis of 50 years in
          star work, astrologer Ellias Lonsdale explains how each of the 12
          signs of the zodiac has 30 degrees, and each degree, like every star,
          is the center of a whole system of meanings. Inspired by the Chandra
          Symbols--evocative images for each degree channeled by John Sandbach
          nearly 40 years ago--as well as his studies with master astrologers
          Dane Rudhyar and Marc Edmund Jones, Lonsdale explores the deeper
          story, or Star Spark, of each of the 360 degrees of the zodiac,
          providing detailed write-ups for each degree. <br /><br />The author
          explains how to use the degree of your Sun sign and other planets from
          your birth chart for personal chart interpretation. Offering a way to
          tune in to your future star cycles as well as analyze a past event, he
          discusses how you can learn about personal cycles from studying the
          degree of a transiting or progressed planet at a specific time, such
          as Mercury Retrograde, or by following the degree meanings for
          successive New Moons or Solar Returns, revealing collective as well as
          personal timings. He also details how to use the 360 Star Sparks as an
          astrological oracle to consult when you need guidance or support for
          your awakening process as well as how they can be used as a source for
          daily contemplation by following the Sun through each degree day by
          day throughout the year. <br /><br />Providing an astrological tool to
          help you see deeply inside your life, your shadow, what you are
          questioning, and where you are being guided, this key to the symbolic
          power of the 360 degrees of the zodiac shows that by embracing our
          star cycles, we can discover our unique life path and light up the
          stars within.

          "If you are someone who enjoys working with imagery, either as an
          artistic, writer, or depth-psychologist, this is definitely a
          must-have for one’s astrological collection. Because of the simplicity
          of the method and boundless possibilities of integrating the Chandra
          Symbols and star sparks, I think this is a great book for astrological
          beginners. Though even those who have lived by the stars for quite
          some time are sure to find something meaningful in Lonsdale’s works."
