            >Psychic medium B. Anne Gehman gave her first spirit readings to her
            teddy bears at age five. Raised in the Mennonite tradition, she left
            home at age 14 to finish her schooling. A life-changing near-death
            experience led Anne to develop her natural gifts, including an
            uncanny ability to predict future events. <br /></b
          ><br />She has gained international attention for her help in solving
          crimes, locating oil and missing persons, healing illnesses, and
          connecting family members with their loved ones in spirit. She has
          worked with top government agencies and officials, police departments,
          judges, and corporate CEOs. While remarkable for her spiritual gifts
          and experiences, Anne’s life is all the more fascinating due to an
          unusual twist: she is married to Wayne Knoll, Ph.D., a former Jesuit
          priest. <br /><br />A brilliant student devoted to his faith, Wayne
          also left home at 14 to join a Roman Catholic seminary. Even while
          pursuing his life’s dream as a professor of literature at Georgetown
          University, Wayne felt an emptiness that only a woman could fill.
          After more than a decade of religious training, he made the wrenching
          decision to leave the priesthood, not knowing if he would find the
          love he sought. <br /><br />
          <i>The Priest and the Medium</i> shares the remarkable true story of
          two soul mates on parallel paths with divergent beliefs, yet united in
          their love for God and each other.<br /><br /><b

          “<i>The Priest and the Medium </i>is a wonderfully rich and inspiring
          tale of two truly exceptional people. Their love spans the distance of
          two vastly divergent worlds, and their story is so compelling that
          you’ll find it difficult to put this fascinating book down!”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“I had a hard time putting this book down.
          <i>The Priest and the Medium </i>is a real page-turner.”<br /><b
            >— Joseph A. Pepe</b
          >, NYPD detective, retired<br /><br />“We are all fascinated by
          priests and mediums. This book will keep you turning the pages as you
          follow the spiritual journeys of two intriguing people. Each grew up
          in loving families but took paths that were at times lonely . . .
          until they found each other. A wonderful book!”<br /><b>
            —Ellen Ratner</b
          >, bureau chief, Talk Radio News Service and Talkers Magazine<br /><br />“This
          book is bound to intrigue you with its insights into the religions of
          Spiritualism and Catholicism. Be ready for tears as a famous medium,
          the Rev. B. Anne Gehman, shares stories of communication between
          spirit and their loved ones on earth. Belief in God takes the Jesuit
          priest and the Spiritualist medium on a rocky path to shared love—of
          each other and God.”<br /><b>— Rev. Lelia E. Cutler</b>, NST,
          president, National Spiritualist Association of Churches<br /><br />“Dr.
          Wayne Knoll is a legendary teacher at Georgetown University. One of my
          problems while chairman of the English department was consoling
          students who couldn’t find a place in his popular, over-enrolled
          classes. Anne Gehman is an extraordinarily sensitive, perceptive,
          empathetic person. Their story—sad in places, inspiring in more—has
          great human interest throughout.”<br /><b>— Paul Betz</b>, professor
          of English, Georgetown University<br /><br />“Suzanne Giesemann has
          written a wonderful book. The storytelling is expertly crafted. Easy
          and enjoyable to read, it’s an old-fashioned love story, but in
          following these two spiritual journeys, we learn a great deal about
          how to deal with some of the most important issues each of us faces as
          we move inexorably toward our final days. Science-minded people tend
          to avoid facing such questions, and spiritually minded people tend to
          pretend science isn’t relevant to such questions. Every reader could
          profit by reading this thought-provoking book.”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“Congratulations to Suzanne Giesemann for vividly
          capturing and telling this intriguing story. Midway through life, this
          remarkable priest and medium found an unlikely soul mate in the other.
          They joined forces to continue a fabulous, spirit-filled voyage
          together, savoring their love affair with God and the infinite and
          unexpected possibilities of life on multiple planes.”<br /><b

          and/or true crime should find this a stirring read.”<br /><b
