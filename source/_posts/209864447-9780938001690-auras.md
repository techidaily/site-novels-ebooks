            <br />The secret to aura sight is to retrain the focusing parts of
            your eyes to see things that have always been there, but you have
            never been able to see before. It's really not complicated. Anyone
            can do it using Embrosewyn's proven techniques and eye exercises.
            The author has been seeing brightly colored auras for over 60 years
            and teaching others to begin seeing auras within 5 minutes for the
            last 22 years. "Auras: How to See, Feel &amp; Know," includes all
            the power techniques, tools and full color eye exercises from his
            popular workshops.<br /><br />For those who already have experience
            seeing auras, the deeper auric layers and subtle auric nuances and
            the special ways to focus your eyes to see them are explained in
            detail, with full color pictures and illustrations to show you how
            the deeper layers and auric aberrations appear.<br />&nbsp;

            information, filled with dozens of original illustrations, eye

          "I was amazed with Auras: How to See, Feel, &amp; Know. The book is
          full of excellent information and detailed exercises that allow you to
          fully see Auras. Once I began reading, I was soon experiencing all the
          effects and enjoying the outcome. I have to say that I'm not surprised
          at how well this book is written because I have read several other
          books by Embrosewyn Tazkuvel, such a great author. I highly recommend
          anyone curious about Auras to get this book. You will open your mind
          up to wonders." ~ Let's ReadCharles

          <br />"What a fascinating and enlightening read. I was mesmerized and
          completely immersed from the moment I started reading this wonderful
          book. I love the authors writing style. He covers so much material but
          he really describes everything in a very upbeat and easy to understand
          way. This is also the only book that I have seen that is a complete
          how-to manual and how-to train yourself and your eyes to see people's
          auras. I am completely blown away. Five big stars!" ~Anna Arontel

          "I've been studying energy for quite a while and auras have always
          been a fascination category. I've read books, online resources and
          even full aura seeing courses. With that said, this is THE BEST
          resource I've had the pleasure of encountering so far. Not only does
          it teach you great exercises (and BIG thank you for the 3D images!) as
          it has a very insightful interpretation and healing section. These
          chapters have information that I've not encountered elsewhere This
          book is a BRILLIANT buy!" ~ Isabel Martins

          "A comprehensive set of instructions for anyone to train themselves to
          see auras. Takes you step by step through the process. What I really
          like about this book is that it contains multiple exercises (with
          excellent illustrations) that will help train your eyes to "see" auras
          since most people aren't used to looking at things in this manner. The
          writing is precise and helpful without being boring. It also contains
          some really great information on body language and how to read an aura
          once you finally see it. This is a perfect book for beginners to learn
          with or for advanced practitioners to use to add to their skill set."
          ~Kara<br /><br />"Breathtaking clear, comprehensible and not too
          simple. A wonderful, informative book. It is a page turner as well.
          This one book covers the whole spectrum. What a delightful man and
          writer who engagingly shares his knowledge and experiences. I'm
          grateful I came across this. AND.....My aura sight improved
          immediately. I can easily see the first two or three layers. Great
          book." ~ Gina Sanchez<br />&nbsp;

          "I was a huge skeptic and got the book thinking I was going to blast
          it in the reviews. After reading through it though I realize that I
          was completely wrong! The author does a great job explaining exactly
          what an aura is, as well as how to interpret them. There are very good
          exercises to help you train your eyes to see auras." ~ Irish Times

          "The author, a definitive authority on the subject, has provided the
          best insight on auras that I have found. If anyone else is looking for
          a book that disposes of boring rote techniques and useless chatter
          while providing illuminating provisions regarding the aura, then you
          can't do better than this one. I've no doubt that it's going to remain
          a primary reference in my personal library for a long time to come." ~
