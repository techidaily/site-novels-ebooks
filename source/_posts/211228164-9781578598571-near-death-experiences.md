              >Thousands, perhaps millions, of people have had near-death
              experiences (NDEs). Why do so many report uncannily similar
              experiences? What are they—a simple trick of the mind and body or
              something more? What are we to make of them, and do they tell us
              anything about the possibility of an afterlife?</b
            ><br /><br />An illuminating and thought-provoking journey into the
            enigmatic territory where science, spirituality, and human
            consciousness converge,
            <b

            >
            presents a comprehensive journey through different interpretations
            of NDEs:<br /><br />
          </p>
          <b>The Scientific.</b> What neuroscience, medicine, and biology have
          to say about what happens at the brink of death.
          <b>The Religious.</b> What NDE-like experiences found in the Bible,
          the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Talmud, the Quran, and other
          religious tracts tell us. <b>Historic and Personal.</b> What folklore
          and personal stories reveal about this alternate consciousness that
          occurs during a life-threatening situation.<b>The Metaphysical.</b>
          Possible answers involving quantum reality, parallel universes, and
          the subconscious.<br /><br />Challenging you to explore all
          possibilities, <i><b>Near Death Experiences</b></i> will have you
          reconsidering your understanding of life, death, and consciousness!
          With more than 100 photos and graphics, this tome is richly
          illustrated. Its helpful bibliography provides sources for further
          exploration, and an extensive index adds to its usefulness.
