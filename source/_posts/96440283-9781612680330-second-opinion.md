        </h4>
        <p>
          Radha Gopalan, M.D. Cardiologist, Acupuncturist and Certified Yoga
          Instructor<br /><br />Born in northern Sri-Lanka, Dr. Radha Gopalan
          started his medical education at North Colombo Medical College in
          1985. When civil unrest put his studies on hold, he seized the
          opportunity to become an acupuncturist at the International University
          for Complementary Medicines in Colombo, Sri-Lanka. In 1990, and
          already well versed in Eastern and Western philosophies of medicine,
          Dr. Gopalan transferred to St. Georges University to complete his
          medical degree.<br />By 1993, Dr. Gopalan’s interest in eastern
          philosophy took him to London, where he worked as an acupuncturist
          with the acclaimed Dr. Ravi Ponniah. Again, East met West as he
          observed the integration of Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Osteopathy and
          herbs in the treatment of patients.<br /><br />Dr. Gopalan returned to
          the United States for his post-graduate training in Internal Medicine
          and Cardiology in New Jersey. He?received additional fellowship
          training in Cardiac Electrophysiology, as well as another fellowship
          in Heart Transplant at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia.
          He is also an acupuncturist and certified yoga instructor and is board
          certified in Internal Medicine, Cardiology, Heart Transplant and
          Medical Acupuncture.<br />After working in Scottsdale, Arizona for
          several years, he now lives in New York City and continues to blend
          East and West as a Heart Failure and Heart Transplant Cardiologist.
