          A practical guide to the Anglo-Saxon Futhark and how runes were used
          in Old England <br /><br />• Examines the 33 Northumbrian runes of the
          Anglo-Saxon Futhark, providing the meanings, historical uses,
          symbolism, and related tree and plant spirits for each <br /><br />•
          Explores geomancy divination practices, the role of sacred numbers,
          and the power of the eight airts, or directions <br /><br />• Provides
          a magical history of Northumbria, as well as a look at the
          otherworldly beings who call these lands home, including boggarts,
          brownies, and dragons <br /><br />• Shows how traditional spirituality
          is intimately tied to the landscape and the cycle of the seasons
          <br /><br />In the early Anglo-Saxon period, the region of Great
          Britain known as Northumbria was a kingdom in its own right. These
          lands, in what is now northern England and southeast Scotland, were
          the targets of the first Viking raids on Britain. This violent influx,
          followed by the establishment of trade routes with the Norse, brought
          the runes to the region, where they intermingled with local magical
          traditions and legends, resulting in the development of a practical
          runic wisdom entirely unique to Northumbria. <br /><br />In this guide
          to the Wyrdstaves, or runic practices, of Old Northumbria, Nigel
          Pennick examines the thirty-three runes of the Anglo-Saxon Futhark and
          how they were used in Old England for weaving the web of Wyrd. Sharing
          runic lore and legends from the area, he explains how the Northumbrian
          runes are unique because they contain elements from all the cultures
          of the region, including the Picts, Britons, Romans, Angles, Scots,
          and Norse. He illustrates how each rune in this tradition is a
          storehouse of ancient knowledge, detailing the meanings, historical
          uses, symbolism, and related tree and plant spirits for each of the
          thirty-three runes. The author describes the Northumbrian use of runes
          in magic and encryption and explores geomancy divination practices,
          the role of sacred numbers, and the power of the eight airts, or
          directions. He also shows how the Northumbrian runes have a close
          relationship with Ogam, the tree alphabet of the ancient Celts.
          <br /><br />Providing a magical history of Northumbria, as well as a
          look at the otherworldly beings who call these lands home, including
          boggarts, brownies, and dragons, Pennick explains how traditional
          spirituality is intimately tied to the landscape and the cycle of the
          seasons. He reveals how the runic tradition is still vibrantly alive
          in this area and ready for us to reawaken to it.

          “In Runic Lore and Legend: Wyrdstaves of Old Northumbria, Pennick
          delivers the most thorough account of Anglo-Saxon history, mythology,
          and cosmology. His ability to weave their narrative into the use of
          the Northumbrian Runes and reveal their modern relevance is nothing
          less than magickal.”
