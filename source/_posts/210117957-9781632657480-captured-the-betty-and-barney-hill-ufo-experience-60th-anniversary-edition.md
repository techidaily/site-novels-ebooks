            taken apart, meticulously re-examined by Betty’s niece Kathleen
            Marden and nuclear physicist Stanton T. Friedman, and reinforced by

          <p>
            Today, 60 years after the UFO abduction of Betty and Barney Hill,
            more and more people are convinced that UFOs are real and their
            existence is being covered up by the government. If you have doubts
            or questions about the Hill case or alien experiences in general,
            <i>Captured!</i> will give you the answers you’re searching for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1961 abduction of the Hills stirred worldwide interest and
            enthralled the public and media for decades. The case is mentioned
            in almost all UFO abduction books. It also became a target for
            debunkers, who still attack it today. But the complete story of what
            really happened that day, its effect on the participants, and the
            findings of investigators has never been told—until now.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;<i>Captured!&nbsp;</i>you’ll get an insider’s look at the
            alien abduction, previously unpublished information about the lives
            of the Hills before and after Barney’s death in 1969, their status
            as celebrities, Betty’s experiences as a UFO investigator, and other
            activities before her death in 2004. Kathleen Marden, Betty Hill’s
            niece, shares details from her discussions with Betty and from the
            evidence of the UFO abduction. She also looks at the Hills’ riveting
            hypnosis sessions about their time onboard the spacecraft. The
            results of a new chemical analysis of the dress Betty was abducted
            in is shared, which found unusual and rare elements on it Newly
            discovered letters at the American Philosophical Society by debunker
            Philip Klass, regarding an orchestrated plot to paint Betty as
            delusional reveal what early detractors tried to do. In addition,
            coauthor, physicist, and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman reviews and
            refutes the arguments of those who have attacked the Hill case,
            including the star map Betty Hill saw inside the craft and later
            recreated.
