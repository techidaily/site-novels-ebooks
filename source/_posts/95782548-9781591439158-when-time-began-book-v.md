          Night and day, month after month, year after year, our ancestors
          dutifully recorded the passage of time on clay tablets, watching the
          heavens from stage towers and pyramids and from megalithic monuments
          whose incredible size and precise architecture boggle the mind. . . .
          Who were the builders of these mysterious structures? What was their
          purpose? Whose signature is indelibly written on these timeless
          stones, and who was the Divine Architect? Why was Stonehenge and its
          likes built by ancient civilizations at the very same time--4,100
          years ago? What is their message for our time? With these questions in
          mind, Zecharia Sitchin, renowned researcher of past ages, takes us on
          a journey through the records of time in this, the fifth book of his
          <i>Earth Chronicles</i> series. Drawing deeply on Sumerian and
          Egyptian writings, millenia-old artifacts, and sacred architecture
          ranging from ancient Mesopotamia to pre-Columbian civilizations in the
          Americas, this bestselling scholar provides astounding insights into
          the origins of the calendar, astronomy, and astrology. He takes
          readers to the climax circa 2100 b.c. when Marduk, the Babylonian
          national god, attained supremacy on Earth and proclaimed the New Age
          of Aries--after which society, religion, science, and the status of
          women were never the same.

        <p>
          Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) was born in Russia and grew up in
          Palestine, where he acquired a profound knowledge of modern and
          ancient Hebrew, other Semitic and European languages, the Old
          Testament, and the history and archaeology of the Near East. A
          graduate of the University of London with a degree in economic
          history, he worked as a journalist and editor for many years prior to
          undertaking his lifeâ€™s work--<i>The Earth Chronicles</i>. <br />
          <br />One of the few scholars able to read the clay tablets and
          interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian, Sitchin based
          <i>The Earth Chronicles</i> series on the texts and pictorial evidence
          recorded by the ancient civilizations of the Near East. His books have
          been widely translated, reprinted in paperback editions, converted to
          Braille for the blind, and featured on radio and television programs.
