          • Shows you how to recognize and transform daily difficulties into
          opportunities, empowering you to use every challenge as a tool to find
          deeper peace<br /><br />• Offers a variety of practices, including
          exercises and action steps, to enable you to more fully integrate your
          spiritual beliefs into daily life<br /><br />• Emphasizes working with
          energy frequencies, rather than thoughts, as a means to reach inner
          healing, transformation, and self-empowerment<br /><br />In this
          powerful guide, spiritual teacher Selina Maitreya shares a radical
          process of self-transformation that allows you to discover your
          highest potential. Drawing on her 25 years of experience as a
          spiritual teacher, Maitreya explores how to recognize and transform
          the challenges you experience into tools to raise your consciousness,
          thus empowering you to use each difficult life experience as a tool to
          create peace and build the foundation for a truly abundant life.<br /><br />Maitreya
          shares her own journey, when all her plans for her future ended in the
          blink of an eye, leading to the creation of this book. Pulled from her
          car with the Jaws of Life following a collision, she was diagnosed
          with a traumatic brain injury that left her unable to live anything
          close to a normal life. Her physical and intellectual disabilities
          were huge and went on for the next four years. Yet she experienced a
          connection to Oneness during this time that she had never experienced
          before. In Oneness was the respite she had always sought, and all she
          had to do was close her eyes and breathe.<br /><br />Through simple,
          practical exercises, as well as inspiring transformational goals and
          action steps, the author emphasizes the importance of accessing and
          raising your inner vibration. She introduces you to your energetic
          systems and teaches how to respond to any life difficulty—from a small
          irritation to a major life tragedy—using the energy of love rather
          than the energy of fear. By focusing on energy frequencies, rather
          than thoughts or emotions, she demonstrates how working with the heart
          frequency can provide ways to understand, work through, and transform
          challenges that arise—better connecting you to the higher frequency
          state of your intuition. As your personal vibration rises, you attract
          the people, situations, and events that align with your unique path
          toward creating and living an extraordinary life.

          awareness and <i>Raise Your Frequency, Transform Your Life</i> is one
          of the best. In a very down-to-earth style, Selina Maitreya shares
          insights that will be enjoyed by those new to their spiritual journey
          as well as those who have been on their path for decades. Readers are
          taken into the private world of Selina’s own journey, allowing for a
          connection with her on a very deep level. The processes she shares
          throughout the book allow for hands-on experience of shifting one’s
