            <b>A comprehensive guide to the mysteries of the I Ching. </b
            ><br /><br />Originally discovered around 3,000 BCE, the I Ching is
            a collection of symbols that explain how patterns in the universe
            change and shift. These sixty-four symbols contain within them one
            of the most powerful keys to understanding the world around us.
            <i>The Secrets of the I Ching</i> is the definitive guide to
            understanding the ancient mysteries and foundations of the I
            Ching.<br /><br />Authors Dr. David Lee and Joseph K. Kim guide the
            reader from the very beginning of Eastern thought, the concepts of
            Tao and Tai Chi, through the theory of Yin-Yang, Trinity, the Five
            Elements, and other critical concepts that will unlock the full
            meaning of the I Ching. Instead of simply re-interpreting the myriad
            of meanings ascribed to the I Ching, they focus on the symbols
            themselves, offering a new way of understanding its unique power.<br /><br />Filled
            with over three hundred images and backed by in-depth research and
            study, <i>The Secrets of the I Ching</i> is the ultimate guide to
            the I Ching and essential reading for anyone interested in exploring
            the power of this ancient source of wisdom and knowledge.

          "This is a beautifully written book that introduces and explores the
          intricacies of the I Ching. Beginning with an exploration of its
          philosophy and principles, the authors explain how they arise in
          traditional Eastern medicine and their connections with mathematics,
          physics, biology, psychology, and virtually every aspect of our
          existence. If you are interested in understanding an Eastern view of
          our lives, then this is the book for you."<br />—<b
            >Sheldon Kamienny</b
          >, Professor Emeritus of Mathematics at the University of Southern
          California<br /><br />“The authors delve into the complexities of the
          I Ching, unraveling its profound symbols and principles. The practical
          applications and real-life examples further enhance readers’
          understanding and enable the integration of ancient wisdom into our
          daily experiences. Drawing from diverse fields such as philosophy,
          mathematics, physics, and psychology, the book demonstrates how these
          principles resonate with various aspects of our lives, from science
          and nature to human relationships and personal growth. Prepare to
          embark on a journey of self-discovery and connection to the universe
          as you unlock the secrets of the Book of Changes.”<br />—<b

          International Education Institute of Korean Medicine, Vice Director of
          the WHO Collaborating Center, East-West Medical Research Institute<br /><br />"In
          lucid and insightful writing, and by providing many everyday
          references as well as scientific examples, the authors make the
          profound principles of I Ching accessible to laypeople, enabling them
          to understand and connect with its wisdom. The book successfully
          integrates East and West thinking by utilizing the principles and
          wisdom of I Ching. The principles of I Ching underlie all worldly
          phenomena and, therefore, also underlie traditional Sasang medicine,
          including pulse diagnosis, acupuncture, herbal treatment, and dietary
          recommendations for the four main body types. This brilliant and
          comprehensive treatise is an indispensable tool for deepening our
          understanding of our life experience."<br />—<b
