          Reveals the shared ancestry behind our affinity with dolphins and our
          shared destiny <br />
          <br />• Explains how we are both descendants of the aquatic ape and
          still share many physiological features with dolphins that set us
          apart from other primates <br />
          <br />• Explores dolphins’ communication with other species and how
          dolphin therapy has miraculous effects on people with autism, cancer,
          stroke, and depression <br />
          <br />• Explores the connections between dolphins and Atlantis and
          Lemuria <br />
          <br />Wild animals avoid contact with humans, but wild dolphins seek
          us out to play and socialize, even going so far as to voluntarily
          rescue people from drowning. What explains this remarkable natural
          affinity? <br />
          <br />Revealing the evolutionary basis for our special relationship
          with dolphins, Frank Joseph explains how we are both descendants of
          the same ancient branch of human-ity. Building upon the aquatic ape
          theory, he details how we both began on land but devastating floods
          forced our distant ancestors into the seas, where humanity developed
          many of the traits that set us apart from other primates, such as our
          instinctive diving reflex and our newborns’ ability to swim. But while
          some of the aquatic apes returned to land, later evolving into modern
          humans, some remained in the cradle of Mother Ocean and became our
          dolphin cousins. <br />
          <br />Integrating scientific research on dolphin intelligence,
          communication, and physiology with enduring myths from some of the
          world’s oldest cultures, such as the Aborigines, Norse, Greeks, and
          Celts, the author examines our physical commonalities with dolphins,
          including their vestigial thumbs and legs, birth processes, and body
          temperature. He explores dolphins’ uncanny ability to diagnose disease
          such as cancer in humans and how dolphin therapy has had miraculous
          effects on children with autism, victims of stroke, and those
          suffering from depression. He provides evidence for dolphins’
          different attitudes toward men, women, and children, their natural
          affinity with cats and dogs, and their telepathic communication with
          other species, including ours. He explores dolphins’ mysterious role
          in the birth of early civilization and their connections with the Dog
          Star, Sirius, and Atlantis and Lemuria--a bond still commemorated by
          annual gatherings of millions of dolphins. <br />
          <br />As Frank Joseph shows, if we can learn to fully communicate with
          dolphins, accessing their millennia-old oral tradition, we may learn
          the truth about humanity’s origins and our shared future, when
          humankind may yet again quit the land for a final return to the sea.

          “For years we have been hoping that a book on the subject of human/
          dolphin kinship would be written by someone with the credentials to
          treat this special relationship with our aquatic cousins with the
          seriousness the subject requires. Frank Joseph has produced a
          masterful treatment of this ancient family bond between dolphin and
          human that will intrigue, provoke, and satisfy the most exacting
          critic of the challenging aquatic ape theory that links our species as
          one.”
