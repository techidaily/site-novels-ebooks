            >A powerful and timely book teaching women how to connect to the
            wisdom of their bodies to heal, rebalance and transform their
            lives.</b
          ><br /><br />There was a time, roughly 5000 years ago, when SHE Power
          reigned and lady landscapes were revered. A time when the space
          between a woman’s thighs was considered a power portal with a direct
          hookup to Source.<br /><br />Love Your Lady Landscape is a healing
          journey through the terrain of what it is to be a woman. When a woman
          isn't in alignment with her feminine essence, she may experience
          exhaustion and overwhelm, lack sexual desire or passion for life, and
          generally feel "out of sync".<br /><br />In this book, Lisa Lister
          uses a myriad of tools and practices such as Earth based spirituality,
          shamanic teachings, movement and dance, and breath and sound work to
          teach women how to reconnect to their feminine wisdom in order to
          start rebalancing all aspects of their lives.<br /><br />Based on
          Lisa's own 11-year journey of healing and reconnecting with her body,
          this book will help you:<br /><br />• release guilt and shame from the
          past&nbsp;<br />• explore self-pleasure and sensuality&nbsp;<br />•
          understand, read, and connect with your body's signs and
          signals&nbsp;<br />• learn about your menstrual cycle and its
          connection with the rhythms of nature and the universe&nbsp;<br />•
          discover the sacred art of receiving&nbsp;<br />• express your
          creativity&nbsp;<br />• find your voice to communicate your needs,
          wants, and desires<br /><br /><i>Love Your Lady Landscape</i> will
          move women into a fiercely loving and healing relationship with their
          body and will teach them how to use its cycles and signs to create a
          life of vitality, fulfillment, and creation.

          ‘Finally someone is writing about the female body, our cycles and our
          feminine emotional landscapes with wisdom and humour. Lisa Lister
          brings passion, reality and comprehension to the divine feminine and
          is making it her mission to educate and create a dialogue that
          empowers and elevates women to become the modern goddesses we truly
          are. Every woman needs to read <i>Love Your Lady Landscape</i> and
          take back what has been so lost in today’s culture.’<br />-
          <b>Carrie-Anne Moss</b>, actress and founder of annapurnaliving.com<br /><br />‘I’m
          a bloody big fan of Lisa Lister. Lead by the Divine Feminine, Lisa is
          here to write a new story for women and the way the world sees
          menstruation. Compassionate, current and full of sass, in
          <i>Love Your Lady Landscape</i> Lisa guides women to get in flow with
          their cycle, heal their wombs and reclaim the unstoppable She power
          that is their birthright.’<br />- <b>Rebecca Campbell</b>, author of
          <i>Light Is the New Black</i> and <i>Rise Sister Rise</i
          ><br /><br />‘Lisa knows the true importance of women loving and
          honouring their bodies every day. <i>Love Your Lady Landscape</i> is
          liberating, fierce and fascinating – and packed with information that
          ALL women should know.’<br />- <b>Mel Wells</b>, author of
          <i>The Goddess Revolution</i><br /><br />‘Lisa Lister is the woman we
          all wish we were lucky enough to have as our sister. But short of
          having her on speed dial, this book is the next best thing to a
          full-on feminine support system!’<br />- <b>Kathleen McGowan</b>,
          activist and international bestselling author of
          <i>The Expected One </i>and <i>The Book of Love</i><br /><br />‘Lisa
          Lister is sounding the call for you to heal your cycle, accept your
          ever-changing body and honour your feminine soul. This is the
          essential foundation and practice for you to get in your ‘FLO’ and
          become the powerful force of nature that you are designed to be!’<br />-
          <b>Alisa Vitti</b>, hormonal health expert and author of
          <i>Womancode</i><br /><br />‘Lisa Lister doesn’t mess around. She’s
          here to break through boundaries and barriers that have been created,
          and which society defines as “normal”. Teaching and leading women to
          honour their divinity inside and out is no easy task, and I respect
          Lisa wholeheartedly. She is part angel, part goddess and part rocker –
          and her writing is friendly, honest and captivating.’<br />-
          <b>Kyle Gray</b>, bestselling author of <i>Angel Prayers </i>and
          <i>Wings of Forgiveness</i><br /><br />‘Lisa’s sheer passion is
          palpable, whether she’s presenting her practical guide to getting the
          most out of your cycle or tackling complex philosophical questions of
          femaleness. To paraphrase Gail Dines, if women loved their bodies, how
          much might society change for the better? Lisa gives us a glimpse of a
          bright future.’<br />- <b>Holly Grigg-Spall</b>, author of
          <i>Sweetening the Pill</i><br /><br />‘There’s nothing more holy than
          being courageous enough to enter the temple inside you. With crackling
          wit and wise, practical guidance, Lisa Lister reminds us that our
          bodies are not the problem, but rather the goal. She reminds us that
          being spiritual has everything to do with loving every inch of who we
          are, blood, body and soul.’<br />- <b>Meggan Watterson</b>, author of
          <i>REVEAL </i>and
          <i>How to Love Yourself (and Sometimes Other People)<br /><br /></i
          >‘Lisa Lister is love on fire, and a true embodiment of the Goddess on
          Earth. Women awaken to an unconditional and healing love in Lisa’s
          wake. Her words, all from the deepest caverns of her heart, touch the
          hearts of all who read her. To read Lisa is to know her, and to know
          Lisa is to know oneself.’<br />- <b>Sarah Durham Wilson</b>, founder
          of doitgirl.com and author of <i>The Do It Girl Diaries</i
          ><br /><br />‘As women continue to fight for equality, Lisa reconnects
          the modern woman with her innate feminine wiles. Yes, it gets bloody
          and intimate, but the lack of that truth has sanitized our existence…
          until now. In this intriguing and beautifully unsanitary account, Lisa
          allows us to own our bodies and to know how they really work. Delving
          beyond the physical, this is a spiritual, transformative read. One for
          all our sisters and daughters.’<br />- <b>Alice Grist</b>, author of
          <i>The High-heeled Guide to Enlightenment</i> and
          <i>Dear Poppyseed</i>
