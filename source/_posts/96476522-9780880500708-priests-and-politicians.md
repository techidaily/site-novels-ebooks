          "For five thousand years the politician and the priest have been in
          the same business."<br /><br />In this provocative volume, Osho
          invites us to look through his microscope and examine not only the
          profound influence of religion and politics in society, but also its
          influence in our inner world. To the extent we have internalized and
          adopted as our own the values and belief systems of the “powers that
          be,” he says, we have boxed ourselves in, imprisoned ourselves, and
          tragically crippled our vision of what is possible.<br /><br />From
          Occupy Wall Street to the Arab Spring, from the election of the first
          Black president in the United States to the appointment of a new pope
          who promises to use St. Francis of Assisi as a role model (following
          endless scandals involving child abuse) the roles of priests and
          politicians in our public life have recently captured the attention of
          our times, often just initiating another round of hope and subsequent
          disillusionment.<br /><br />In other words, wittingly or unwittingly,
          we keep digging ourselves deeper into the mess we are in.<br /><br />A
          new kind of world is possible — but only if we understand clearly how
          the old has functioned up to now. And, based on that understanding,
          take the responsibility and the courage to become a new kind of human
          being.<br /><br />"You have to be aware who the real criminals are.
          The problem is that those criminals are thought to be great leaders,
          sages, saints, mahatmas. So I have to expose all these people because
          they are the causes. For example, it is easier to understand that
          perhaps politicians are the causes of many problems: wars, murders,
          massacres, burning people. It is more difficult when it comes to
          religious leaders, because nobody has raised his hand against them.
          They have remained respectable for centuries, and as time goes on
          their respectability goes on growing. The most difficult job for me is
          to make you aware that these people — knowingly or unknowingly, that
          does not matter — have created this world."

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Osho</b> is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have
          influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.
          His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more
          and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around
          the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize
          the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to
          the issues we are facing today. The Sunday Times in London named Osho
          as one of the "1,000 Makers of the 20th Century". He is known around
          the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation - the
          science of inner transformation - with the unique approach of his
          "OSHO Active Meditations" acknowledging the accelerated pace of
          contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life.
