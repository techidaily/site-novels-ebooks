          In 1999, Bronx-born plumber Tommy Rosa died after being the victim of
          a hit-and-run incident. Lying by the road, he felt a tug whisking him
          off into a tunnel of light. He found himself in an indescribably
          beautiful place, filled with a total sense of peace and joy. Tommy met
          his Divine Teacher and received a series of profound lessons—Eight
          Revelations about the nature of health, healing, and well-being. He
          was shown that God created the Earth to nourish and heal mankind and
          that our sense of separation from each other and the divine is of our
          own making.<br /><br />Around the same time, integrative cardiologist
          Dr. Stephen Sinatra was revolutionizing his medical practice with a
          holistic approach to treatment. When a chance meeting brought the two
          men together, they gradually came to realize that the revelations of
          healing from Tommy’s Teacher aligned with the groundbreaking results
          Dr. Sinatra was seeing in his own scientific research.
          <i>Health Revelations from Heaven</i> combines Dr. Sinatra’s practices
          with Tommy’s Revelations to lead you toward revitalized health, a
          newfound sense of purpose, and spiritual balance. Fully corroborated
          by Dr. Sinatra’s four decades of medical expertise, these stories and
          practices can bring the gifts of Heaven and Earth into everyday life.

          “As one of America's foremost integrative cardiologists, Dr. Sinatra
          wonderfully explains how to apply the invaluable health lessons Tommy
          Rosa learned on his journey to Heaven. While not everyone has the
          opportunity to have a NDE, the authors make this rare and special
          experience accessible - bringing Heaven and Earth just a little bit
          closer.” <br /><b
            >—Mark Hyman, MD, author of
            <i>The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet</i><br /></b
          ><br />“<i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> is
          mesmerizing. For the first time, the revelations (of Heaven) from a
          near death experience have been skillfully used to teach us how to
          live healthfully in our bodies right here on earth. I love this book.”
          <br /><b
            >—Christiane Northrup, MD, author of
            <i>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</i> and
            <i>The Wisdom of Menopause<br /></i></b
          ><br />“<i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> is a bold yet
          loving testimonial that elegantly explores humankind's most
          transcendent questions. Through first hand experience, Sinatra and
          Rosa reveal important clues surrounding the great mystery.” <br /><b
            >—David Perlmutter, MD, FACN, author of <i>Grain Brain</i></b
          ><br /><br />“This book comes from someone who took an extraordinary
          trip to heaven and came back to impart profound, life-changing
          lessons. Tommy juxtaposes a deeply spiritual perspective with Dr.
          Sinatra's practical, hands-on strategies to maintain a healthy, happy
          mind, body, and spirit.
          <i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> will change your life,
          so be prepared.” <br /><b
            >—JJ Virgin, CNS, CHFS, author of
            <i>JJ Virgin's Sugar Impact Diet</i><br /></b
          ><br />“Having had a NDE at age four, I know the feeling of
          disappointment I experienced when I didn't die. Consciousness does not
          die and the experience and wisdom shared here will help you to live,
          learn, and accept the truth about life and so-called death.” <br /><b
            >—Bernie Siegel, M.D., author of <i>A Book of Miracles</i><br /></b
          ><br />“Dr. Sinatra has always been on the leading edge in whatever he
          focuses his attention on. He is one of the leaders in natural
          cardiology and the benefits of grounding or earthing. In
          <i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i>, he provides even more
          insights o how to stay healthy based on revelations gleaned from Tommy
          Rosa's very special prolonged near death experience.” <br /><b
            >—Dr. Joseph Mercola, author of <i>Effortless Healing</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> is in
          equal parts informative, inspiring, and revelatory. Told from two
          fascinating perspectives, Dr. Sinatra and Tommy Rosa shed new and much
          needed light on life's greatest mystery. A powerful and brilliant
          work; highly recommended.” <br /><b
            >—Nicholas Perricone, MD, FACN, CNS, author of <i>Forever Young</i
            ><br /></b
          ><br />“<i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> connects you
          to that "impossible to find" place through Tommy Rosa's story. We all
          want to know...what was there, what was it like, why did you come
          back? What are the lessons and how do we apply them to the present in
          order to live a better life physically, emotionally, and spiritually?
          Dr. Sinatra's section of the book supports that mysterious door that
          Tommy went through. This book really makes you want to believe and is
          a riveting read.” <br /><b
            >—Suzanne Somers, actress and author of <i>TOX-SICK</i> and
            <i>Bombshell</i><br /></b
          ><br />“As I read <i>Heaven and Earth</i> the tears ran down my face
          because I knew instinctively Tommy Rosa and Steve Sinatra were telling
          us the most beautiful truth about W<i>ho</i> is with us every moment
          and what lies beyond this life. Such honesty and clarity is rare and I
          thank you for it. We live in a time when "scientific prove" is deemed
          as the ultimate evidence but Tommy, Steve, myself and many others know
          there is much, much more than what can be proven with numbers. I urge
          you to read this book with an open and loving heart so that you too
          may receive the blessings within. Then, I urge you to carry its
          healing truth throughout this life so that it can be shared with all
          of God's children who are suffering.” <br /><b
            >—Richard L. Becker, D.O., author of <i>Foundations for Healing</i
            ><br /></b
          ><br />“Every so often, you come across a book you feel compelled to
          read because it combines so many different aspects of life.
          <i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> is one of those books.
          I read it, I loved it, I learned from it, and I recommend it.”
          <br /><b>—Dannion Brinkley, author of Danny's <i>Day In Heaven</i></b
          ><br /><br />“In the midst of our national health disaster, to
          encounter a book like
          <i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth </i>is like coming upon an
          oasis of refreshing water and wholesome nourishment. This is an
          amazing collaboration between the heaven-inspired spiritual healer,
          Tommy Rosa, and the humane, artful, highly skilled and down-to- earth
          heart doctor, Stephen Sinatra. I am certain readers who are lucky
          enough to read this book will find it life-changing in the best way. I
          heartily recommend these Revelations.” <br /><b
            >—Robert A.F. Thurman, PhD, Professor of Religion at Columbia
            University and author of <i>Love Your Enemies</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Whether you are a plumber or a heart doctor, the road
          less traveled always ends in the same place...spiritual
          enlightenment...as so evidence in this must read, heart moving book.
          Mr. Rosa's and Dr. Sinatra's
          <i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> is a beautifully
          orchestrated tapestry integrating mind and body; heart and soul. Don't
          miss out!” <br /><b>—Eva Herr, author of <i>Consciousness</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Emily Dickinson said, "The only secret people keep is
          immortality." <i>Health Revelations from Heaven and Earth</i> brings
          this "secret" into the open. It's about time, because empirical
          evidence now shows that human conscious extends beyond the body in
          space and time. The fear of total annihilation with bodily death has
          caused more suffering for humans than all the physical diseases
          combined. This book leads us beyond this grim vision to a destiny full
          of hope and beauty.” <br /><b
            >—Larry Dossey, MD, author of <i>One Mind</i></b
          ><br /><br />“For some decades, we have learned about the imperative
          to treat health in a holistic manner. Such an approach has included
          physical, emotional, social, psychological, and cultural dimensions,
          but now a highly-regarded cardiologist includes spirituality into the
          mix. <i>Heaven and Earth</i> takes us on the next step to an authentic
          holistic paradigm.” <br /><b
