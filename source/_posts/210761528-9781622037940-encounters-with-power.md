            <b>A Shamanic Odyssey of Discovery</b><br />&nbsp;<br />When you
            leave the beaten path of civilization, you enter the world of primal
            and mysterious forces—and encounter wonders you never thought
            possible. This is the territory of the shaman. To learn the secrets
            of shamanism, José Luis Stevens has traveled to the remote and wild
            places where the oldest human spiritual practice still exists in its
            purest form. With <i>Encounters with Power, </i>this respected
            teacher invites you to experience his journeys to meet shamans
            around the globe—and share in the wisdom he received. Join this
            master storyteller as he recounts his meetings with Spirit in its
            many guises, including:<br />&nbsp;<br />• India and the
            Life-Changing Reading—at a turning point in his life, Jose receives
            a startlingly accurate prophecy<br />• Lost in Mexico—a humbling
            education in the difference between “power” and “control”<br />• The
            Guatemala Test and Initiation—the power of being frugal with
            judgment and generous with forgiveness<br />• Encounters with the
            Power of Aborigines and Songlines Down Under—sometimes the teacher
            appears when the student is <i>not </i>ready<br />• Journeys for
            Power with Medicine—visions with the plant spirit of ayahuasca<br />•
            A Magical Andes Wedding—an unforgettable ceremony attended by
            people, spirits, and the forces of nature<br />• The Dolphin
            Brujos—nature’s tricksters teach a sharp lesson in responsibility
            and humility<br />• Encounters with the Dark Shaman—a perilous
            jungle journey reveals the ferocity of nature and the dangerous side
            of shamanic practice<br />• Nevado Aconcagua: Pilgrimage to a Sacred
            Mountain—how a holy place can be both a dangerous trial and a source
            of limitless support<br />&nbsp;<br />Power is everywhere—encounters
            with power can happen any time. “In my travels to meet these
            extraordinary healers,” writes José, “I’ve had terrifying,
            enlightening, and at times hugely entertaining adventures. Power can
            destroy us or it can raise us up by teaching us and nourishing us. I
            may not be a master, but I have learned a few things that you may
            find helpful on your own quest.”<br />&nbsp;
