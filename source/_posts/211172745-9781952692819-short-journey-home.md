            >A friend on our path of mindfulness practice, Richard Brady shares
            one of the first deeply personal accounts of a lay practitioner
            following in the steps of world-renowned Zen master Thich Nhat
            Hanh.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Short Journey Home</i> presents a powerful story of
          transformation, rooted in the author’s long-term and life-changing
          practice with Thich Nhat Hanh. Richard Brady guides us through his
          life experiences and lessons learned, offering strikingly deep and
          sincere accounts of:<br /><br />his time spent with Thich Nhat Hanh
          and with senior monastics,&nbsp;his successes and difficulties with
          community building,&nbsp;practicing with family,working with
          death,&nbsp;and sharing the practice with others.<br />Brady
          skillfully grounds his stories in direct teachings offered by Thich
          Nhat Hanh, and he organizes these stories according to some of Thich
          Nhat Hanh’s most powerful lessons on topics like impermanence,
          interbeing, and transformation.&nbsp;<br /><br />By taking these
          teachings to heart, practicing with them diligently, and sharing the
          results, Brady acts as our spiritual companion, demonstrating how the
          Plum Village path of practice can lead us to peace, freedom, and
          awakening in this present moment.
