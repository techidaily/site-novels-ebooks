            <i>Heroes Among Us</i> reminds us all of the courage and dignity it
            takes to stand up for oneself and those around us. By chronicling
            such bravery, John Quiñones captures America's can-do spirit and
            shows that through the slightest good deed, each one of us harbors a
            hero within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Texas native and veteran ABC journalist John Quiñones has traveled
            the world and the country reporting on hundreds of stories during
            his illustrious career. Long ago he realized that the stories he was
            most attracted to had one thing in common—a shared focus on the
            goodness inherent in ordinary Americans.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to John, truly heroic individuals are people who make
            difficult choices, even in the face of danger, without giving in to
            fear. They don't expect fame or money for their efforts—they're just
            doing the right thing. They are compassionate and courageous, and
            our world would be a far worse place without them. They rarely get
            the recognition they deserve.
          </p>
          <p><i>Heroes Among Us</i> means to change that.</p>
          <p>
            Along with reporting the many stories of heroes he's met, John also
            shares his own touching personal narrative of his rise from humble
            roots as the son of a laborer and a house cleaner to his life as a
            network anchor. His is one of the most American of stories.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Heroes Among Us</i>, in its stories of selflessness, strength and
            bravery, offers inspiration, ultimately challenging each of us to
            learn from the great deeds of our neighbors and, in turn, to follow
            in that same heroic spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a book to cherish, one whose wisdom will be felt for years
            to come.
