            What happens when the blinders against quantum "magic" are lifted?
            Our life shifts profoundly. The updated Keep This Quiet! IV, Ancient
            Secrets Revealed, integrates mystical, practical Teachings embedded
            in Harrell's life. The narrative begins in 1991 in Belgium, where
            parapsychological, or siddhi, phenomena follow the death of her
            live-in boyfriend. After a suspenseful visit with Gonzo creator,
            Hunter Thompson, at Owl Farm, whom she has not seen live for
            twenty-one years, she returns to Belgium to dive into the experience
            of spirit committees, visions, computer-PK (mental influence over
            the computer), psychologist Carl Jung, and quantum mechanics.Ancient
            Secrets Revealed uses a combination of storytelling and applied
            ancient/modern wisdom insights. Initiations also involve Hindu
            satguru Dhyanyogi-ji. Many traditions join hands on "the edge" of
            timeless mysteries.

          masters of Light, from the moment I touched this book, its energy
          began to flow through me. If you are ready to welcome energetic shifts
          toward enlightenment and eager to embrace your own deeper
          understanding, this book is for you. This beautifully written volume
          of wisdom provides attunements as you meander through its pages

          “Margaret Harrell's blending and merging the whole of a human being
          and beyond into the cosmos is astounding writing . . . She is working
          with a whole new and different combined East-West and
          Middle&nbsp;Paradigm."—SZANNE V. BROWN, psychologist, former VP,

          “Keep This Quiet! IV is psycho-active. When I was reading about
          Margaret’s Buddha belly, my own Buddha belly swelled up . . . The
          author’s love and spirit are so injected into the book that I think
          it’s going to wake people up.”—JOY AYSCUE, founder of Wake for

          hand analysis description of her as a ‘grand synthesizer’ was apt and
          accurate.”—Ron Rattner, author of the forthcoming From Litigation to
