          A profusely illustrated history of the occult nature of the tarot from
          its origins in ancient Persia<br /><br />• Thoroughly examines the
          original historical source for each tarot card and how the cards’
          divinatory meanings evolved from these symbols<br /><br />• Provides
          authentic 18th- and 19th-century spreads and divination techniques<br /><br />•
          Reveals the divinatory meanings of the cards as understood by diviners
          in the Middle Ages and Renaissance<br /><br />The origins of the tarot
          have been lost in the mists of time. Most scholars have guessed that
          its origins were in China, Egypt, or India. In
          <i>Mystical Origins of the Tarot</i>, Paul Huson has expertly tracked
          each symbol of the Minor Arcana to roots in ancient Persia and the
          Major Arcana Trump card images to the medieval world of mystery,
          miracle, and morality plays. A number of tarot historians have
          questioned the use of the tarot as a divination tool prior to the 18th
          century. But the author demonstrates that the symbolic meanings of the
          Major Arcana were evident from the time they were first employed in
          the mid-15th century in the popular divination practice of sortilege.
          He also reveals how the identities of the court cards in the Minor
          Arcana were derived from a blend of pagan and medieval sources that
          strongly influenced their interpretation in tarot divination.<br /><br /><i

          provides a thorough examination of the original historical source for
          each card and how the cards’ divinatory meanings evolved from these
          symbols. Huson also provides concise and practical card-reading
          methods designed by the cartomancers of the 18th and 19th centuries
          and reveals the origins of the card interpretations promoted by the
          Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and A. E. Waite.

          “Thirty years ago, at the very start of the modern tarot renaissance,
          Paul Huson showed us how to uncover the mythical images and truths of
          the tarot. Now he has returned to incorporate modern scholarship into
          a visionary new concept for deciphering the mystery of the tarot’s
          origins and meaning.”
