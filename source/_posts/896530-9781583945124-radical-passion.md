          This culmination of award-winning author Andrew Harvey’s life’s work
          bridges the great divide between spiritual resignation and engaged
          spiritual activism. A manifesto for the transformation of the world
          through the fusion of deep mystical peace with the clarity of radical
          wisdom, it is a wake-up call to put love and compassion to urgent,
          focused action. According to Harvey, we are in a massive global crisis
          reflected by a mass media addicted to violence and trivialization at a
          moment when what the world actually needs is profound inspiration, a
          return to the heart-centered way of the Divine Feminine, the words of
          the mystics throughout the ages, and the cultivation of the nonviolent
          philosophies of Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, and the
          Dalai Lama. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Harvey’s concepts of radical passion and sacred activism fly in the
          face of restraint, of pessimism, of denial, of all that is inhumane,
          fusing the mystic’s passion for God with the activist’s passion for
          justice and for healing the division between heaven and earth, heart
          and will, body and soul, prayer and action. Sacred activism asks that
          we engage deeply on a personal, spiritual, and political level so as
          to become a fully empowered, fully active, and contemplative humanity
          that can turn tragedy into grace, and desolation into the opportunity
          to build and co-create a new world. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Unlike many spiritual books, <i>Radical Passion</i> does not veil the
          dark with artificial hope. It explores the catastrophes of our current
          times and celebrates the ecstatic hope and divinity that is
          possible—right now and in the future.

          “It is not often that one individual responds to the yearnings of a
          generation the way that Andrew Harvey responds to the times in which
          we live. His piercing intellect and enormous heart bring together an
          understanding of our age as well a non-violent strategy for addressing
          its challenges. His Institute for Sacred Activism is one of the most
          hopeful and powerful resources at our disposal for turning the
          frustration and despair of millions into a wave of positivity.
          Harvey’s work stands out as beacon of hope to whoever longs for a more
          beautiful, just, and peaceful world.”<br />
          —Marianne Williamson, author of <i>The Age of Miracles</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Andrew Harvey is a genius and an inspired visionary who has the
          ability to interpret the meaning and significance of the chaos and
          patterns of change that are redirecting the compass of our
          contemporary culture. He is a spiritual, intellectual, and cultural
          mystic whose passion is to awaken people to a new and essential
          empowerment in this world: Sacred Activism. … His passion clearly
          reveals that his soul is on fire with a grace that comes from the
          Divine.”<br />
          —Caroline Myss, author of <i>Anatomy of the Spirit </i>and<i>
            Sacred Contracts</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Radical Passion</i> is both a trip and a pilgrimage,
          a deep journey of stories, conversations, interviews, and reflections
          on and with such notable spiritual figures as the Dali Lama, Fr. Bede
          Griffiths, Rilke, Rumi, and Hermann Hesse.&nbsp;Harvey brings alive
          good news about how to wake up and shape up before we destroy
          ourselves and the planet.&nbsp;Filled with wisdom and joy, reality and
          pain, critical analysis and practical tools, this book is sure to
          enrich and inspire all who enter its field.”<br />
          —Matthew Fox, theologian and author of
          <i>Original Blessing, The Coming of the Cosmic Christ</i>,
          <i>Christian Mystics, The Pope's War, </i>and
          <i>Hildegard of Bingen: A Saint for Our Times</i>
