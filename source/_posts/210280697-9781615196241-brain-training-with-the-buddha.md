            >The essential guide to training your brain for mindfulness—modern,
            science-based, and with no Buddhism required.</b
          ><br /><br />Longtime meditation teacher Eric Harrison intimately
          understands the benefits of mindfulness, from improved focus and
          better judgment to relaxation and inner peace. He’s helped tens of
          thousands of students to achieve these goals by rooting his practice
          in the Buddha’s original text on how to meditate and live mindfully:
          the&nbsp;<i>Satipatthana Sutta</i>.<br /><br /><i
            >Brain Training with the Buddha&nbsp;</i
          >offers a secular perspective on this ancient wisdom that requires no
          familiarity with Buddhism itself—only openness to the Buddha’s
          original teachings. Harrison’s translation of this sutta (the first in
          modern English) comes with guidance for anyone looking to train their
          mind by applying its thirteen steps to mindful living today.<br /><br />“Brings
          clear thinking, practical wisdom, and welcome rigor to the widely
          popular concept of mindfulness.” —<i>Publishers Weekly</i

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Eric Harrison </b>was born in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1949. He
          graduated from Victoria University with a BA in English literature and
          music, and started his working life as a schoolteacher and journalist.
          Between 1974 and 1985 he spent a total of 18 months doing retreats in
          the Burmese, Tibetan, Zen, and yoga traditions. While he appreciated
          the opportunities to do long retreats, he found he had no appetite for
          Buddhism itself.<br /><br />
          When Eric opened the Perth Meditation Centre in 1987, he chose to use
          secular, rational, and science-based language to explain meditation.
          He later supplemented his knowledge with five years’ study in biology,
          cognitive science, and Western philosophy. This approach made his work
          acceptable to the many doctors and psychologists who referred clients
          to him, and to corporations that have employed him since. He has now
          taught 30,000 people how to meditate, and his previous six books,
          including <i>Teach Yourself to Meditate </i>and
          <i>The 5-Minute Meditator</i>, have been translated into 14 languages.
