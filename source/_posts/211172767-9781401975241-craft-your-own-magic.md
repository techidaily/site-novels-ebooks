            >A call to create your own magical practice by understanding magical
            correspondences, incorporating your own lived experiences and
            ancestry, and applying intuitive insights.</b
          ><br /><br />Crafting your own magic is a personal and fluid journey,
          and you won’t find scripted spells and rituals within these pages.
          Instead, you’ll find a collection of pathways to a magical practice
          rooted in your lived experience and the relationships you form in seen
          and unseen realms. Here, witch, intuitive energy healer, and
          death-worker Cassie Uhl will share techniques to hone your inherent
          intuitive abilities, personal experiences, and practices—all of which
          she encourages you to modify to suit your needs. Your magical practice
          and the path that shapes it will be as unique as you are, as it should
          be. Uhl walks you through crafting your own magic using the elements
          as guideposts: air, on developing intuition; fire, on magic in
          relationship; water, on correspondences; earth, on ethics and
          ancestry; and spirit, on bringing it all together.<br /><br />What
          crafting your own magic looks like for you will be personal and fluid.
          Where would you turn to seek inspiration, community, means, and modes
          to craft your magic? Perhaps you would shift inward to the trees,
          flowers, birds, or invisible in-between spaces. There will likely be
          parts of your magical practice that no one but you will be able to
          define as true. For these reasons, parts of crafting your own magic
          may feel uncomfortable. From these places of discomfort, not knowing,
          and becoming, your magical practices can flourish.

          <b>Asha Frost</b>, Indigenous medicine woman and author of
          <i>You Are the Medicine</i><br /><br />“<i>Craft Your Own Magic</i> is

          own unique kind of magic. Cassie shares generous guidance on forging
          an ethical, reciprocal path in a way that honors your imagination and
          celebrates the ever-evolving nature of magic. This book feels like
          sitting with a wise friend who empowers you to trust your intuition as
          you explore and create a personalized magical practice.”<br />—
          <b>Edgar Fabián Frías</b>, artist, psychotherapist, educator, and
          brujx<br /><br />“Cassie is a wealth of knowledge! I have read her
          books and interviewed her on my podcast, and her perspective is so
          refreshing in this industry. Cassie is able to break down spiritual
          concepts in such a tangible way and really respects the origins and
          the people from which these practices come. She has an innate wisdom
          that touches her reader and really helps them embody the earth’s
          wisdom with universal love. Please buy anything this woman writes!”<br />—
          <b>Alea Lovely</b>, host of the <i>Spiritual Shit</i> podcast and
          author of <i>Meaningful Manifestation</i><br /><br />“Rooted in
          relationship-building, this book feels like a breath of fresh air that
          is a thoughtful and considered guide to magical workings. Cassie
          writes about magic through the lens of working with the elements as a
          framework for the craft. She shares glimpses into her personal journey
          of developing her magical practice; and the pages contain so much
          richness compared to the flood of ready-made spellbooks available.
          This book is thought provoking and makes one consider their
          relationship with the natural world, with spirit, with their
          community, and with their craft.”<br />— <b>Ashley Leavy</b>, author
          of <i>The Beginner’s Guide to Crystal Healing</i><br /><br />“<i

          journey through the elements of magical practice. Rooted in
          compassion, discernment, and authenticity, this book empowers you
          craft a more meaningful and magical daily practice.”<br />—
          <b>Nicholas Pearson</b>, author of <i>Crystal Basics</i> and
          <i>Flower Essences from the Witch’s Garden</i><br /><br />“I am
          breathing more deeply after reading <i>Craft Your Own Magic</i>! What
          a relief it is to release myself from so much of my self-imposed
          pressure to be a ‘perfect’ magician. Cassie Uhl has helped me to
          ground in my body and my full humanity—the good, the bad, the ugly,
          and the beautiful—so that I can be more effective in my work as a
          healer. As a white woman of Northern European descent living in
          America, Uhl has inspired me to meet the past, present, and future
          with more humility, wisdom, and trust. She has assured me that I have
          a place in helping to create a new world.”<br />— <b>Sil Read</b>,
