            Shero marveled at the call. For more than a decade she and her
            friend had been estranged and now, in a single and simple phone
            call, it was changing. They made plans to meet later that very day.
            Shero was now sitting on a bench at the beach, watching the steady
            waves roll gently onto the beach. They reminded her of the
            continuity of life and the ever-invisible power behind all things.
            The sky was a light powder-blue; the water a deep turquoise. The day
            was magnificent; her heart was full and her mind a bit blown away.
            There was so much to process as old memories and feelings arose. She
            could feel an inner journey about to begin; one that was calling her
            so deeply. Shero left the beach and returned to her room. Her inner
            journeys would cause her to fall fast asleep, like being taken out
            of consciousness and into a deeper-than-dreaming state. She would
            often lose all sense of time, almost as if being in a different
            dimension. Her experiences in the journey state were as real as any
            life experience.
          </p>

            Shero’s journey includes a typical hero’s journey, but in addition
            to dragons and lions and fires; she also learns to navigate the
            human conditions of shame, blame, rage, terror and betrayal. As she
            does, she discovers her mission or calling on the planet, her reason
            for being – and its even bigger than she can imagine!&nbsp;
