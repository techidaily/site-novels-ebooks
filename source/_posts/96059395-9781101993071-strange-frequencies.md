            >A journey through the attempts artists, scientists, and tinkerers
            have made to imagine and communicate with the otherworldly using
            various technologies, from cameras to radiowaves.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Strange Frequencies</i> takes readers on an
          extraordinary narrative and historical journey to discover how people
          have used technology in an effort to search for our own immortality.
          Bebergal builds his own ghostly gadgets to reach the other side, too,
          and follows the path of famous inventors, engineers, seekers, and
          seers who attempted to answer life's ultimate mysteries. He finds that
          not only are technological innovations potent metaphors keeping our
          spiritual explorations alive, but literal tools through which to
          experiment the boundaries of the physical world and our own
          psyches.<br /><br />Peter takes the reader alongside as he
          explores:<br />the legend of the golem and the strange history of
          automata;a photographer who is trying to capture the physical
          manifestation of spirits; a homemaker who has recorded voicemails from
          the dead;a stage magician who combines magic and technology to alter
          his audience's consciousness;and more.

        <p>
          “With all human culture arguably evolved from Palaeolithic shamanism,
          Bebergal engagingly explores the uncanny overlap between an ancient
          landscape of occult ideas and today’s techno-saturated environment,
          from Victorian table-tilting to the digitally remastered voices of the
          dead; from confidence tricksters, through the desperate or delusional,
          to the artists and visionaries currently exploring this marvelous,
          ectoplasm-damp material. An absorbing, comprehensive guide to the
          high-definition séance parlor of the modern world, and a timely
          reminder that, in contemporary civilization, we are never more than a
          couple of centuries away from an alchemist.”—<b>Alan Moore</b
          ><br /><br />"Enchanting and provocative....&nbsp;For all those who
          have ever considered the tension between science and religion, or
          technology and supernatural, <i>Strange Frequencies</i> will certainly
          enchant, entertain, and instruct."—<b>Diana Walsh Pasulka,</b>
          <i><b>Los Angeles Review of Books</b></i
          ><br /><br />“Even the most well-read esoteric scholar will find some
          new and fascinating bit of lore in Bebergal’s book… an engrossing
          read… And as far as tour guides to the occult underworld go, you
          couldn’t ask for a better Virgil than Bebergal: his prose is warm,
          clever and erudite without being alienating. Read it with as open a
          mind as he wrote it and you’ll be bound to pick up a few interesting
          frequencies on your wavelength.”—<b><i>Fortean Times</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Bebergal dives into the relationship between technical
          and occult imagination and comes up with something profound about the
          human experience. By turns funny, spooky, thought-provoking, and
          moving, <i>Strange Frequencies</i> is brilliant work.”—<b
            >Daniel Abraham,
            <b
              ><i>New York Times</i> bestselling co-author of&nbsp;the Expanse
              series<br /><br /></b></b
          >“This enchanting, insightful book equates the effects of diverse
          phenomena from Elizabethan stagecraft, cybernetics and handmade
          automata and the Brazen Head to astral travel and ectoplasmic
          manifestations—and examines them all in light of the human hunger for
          a magic that may be far closer to us than we know.”—<b
            >Maria Bustillos</b
          ><br /><br />“Bebergal deftly explores how we subliminally or overtly
          use science and technology to rediscover the evolutionary metaphysical
          heart of what it means to be human, and our desire to speak with
          voices no longer bound to the Earthly plane.”—<b
            >J. H. Williams III,
            <i>Sandman: Overture, Promethea, Echolands, Batwoman</i></b
          ><br /><br />"In these technology-haunted times, we are sorely in need
          of a guide for the perplexed limning the connections between our
          eternally seeking souls and our gadget-addled minds. Peter Bebergal is
          the ideal companion on this quest, finding ghosts hidden in the
          machines all around us. <i>Strange Frequencies</i> is delightful and
          engaging examination of the human desire to forge new keys to unlock
          the mysteries of life.”—<b
            >Peter Manseau, author of <i>The Apparitionists</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Ever dream of building a monster in your basement?
          Photographing ghosts? Entering drug-free states of euphoria? You’re
          not alone. In this brilliant, knowing, and thrill-a-page historical
          and literary exploration, Peter Bebergal explores the human endeavor
          to use technology to probe hidden and forbidden zones.
          <i>Strange Frequencies</i> expands how we understand technology, and
          takes us into shadowy realms where science and strangeness
          intermingle.”—<b
