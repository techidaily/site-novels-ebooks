            Whether it happens all at once or gradually over time, spiritual
            awakening is an experience that may be accompanied by great insight,
            ecstatic bliss, or a mystical infusion of light, love, and vision.
            But it can be an overwhelming experience, too, leaving those to whom
            it’s occurred searching for answers and understanding. Written by a
            transpersonal psychologist and non-dual teacher, this book will help
            you understand the phenomenon of spiritual awakening, and provide
            guidance and support for you on your spiritual journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the heart of most spiritual traditions is the understanding that
            we are one with all of existence. This realization, also known as
            spiritual awakening or spiritual emergence, can occur spontaneously,
            after years of spiritual practice, or through many other portals.
            Although awakening is often considered a purely positive experience,
            many people are not prepared for the ramifications of such a
            life-altering event. When your perception of yourself and reality
            has been altered, you may find yourself with more questions than
            answers. Where can you turn?
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on over thirty years of case studies, as well as the author’s
            own experiences, <i>When Spirit Leaps </i>explores the why and what
            of spiritual awakening, revealing how this phenomenon occurs across
            all traditions, and exploring the various ways it can happen.
            Including discussions on kundalini energy, meditation, yoga and
            qigong, breathwork, near-death experiences, and much more, this
            inspirational book offers companionship and practical solutions to
            common challenges along the spiritual path of awakening.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this book as your guide, you’ll gain a deep understanding of
            the process and different portals of awakening, and find comfort and
            support in the real-life stories of those who have experienced this
            shift in consciousness and faced its challenges. Most importantly,
            you’ll learn how you can embody this awakening and live joyfully and
            effectively without attachment to a personal sense of self, but as
            the oneness with all that is your true nature. No matter where you
            are on your spiritual journey, this book will help you along the
            way.
