        </h4>
        <p>
          Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from
          the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began
          disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close
          business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being
          received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical
          questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations,
          Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of
          Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of
          how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference
          center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately
          50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction
          workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding
          stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has
          been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers
          and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of
          Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures,
          and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person
          to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of
          spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November
          2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther
          continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her
          physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical
          help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly
          by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online
          live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube
          library of Abraham videos. Abraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical
          teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And
          as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of
          loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in
          print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our
          loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total
          Self. Abraham-Hicks Publications may be contacted through the
