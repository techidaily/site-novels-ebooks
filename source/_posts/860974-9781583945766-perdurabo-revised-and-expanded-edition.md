            >A rigorously researched biography of the founder of modern magick,
            as well as a study of the occult, sexuality, Eastern religion, and
            more</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />The name “Aleister Crowley” instantly conjures
          visions of diabolic ceremonies and orgiastic indulgences—and while the
          sardonic Crowley would perhaps be the last to challenge such a view,
          he was also much more than “the Beast,” as this authoritative
          biography shows.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i>Perdurabo</i>—entitled after the
          magical name Crowley chose when inducted into the Hermetic Order of
          the Golden Dawn—traces Crowley’s remarkable journey from his birth as
          the only son of a wealthy lay preacher to his death in a boarding
          house as the world’s foremost authority on magick. Along the way, he
          rebels against his conservative religious upbringing; befriends famous
          artists, writers, and philosophers (and becomes a poet himself); is
          attacked for his practice of “the black arts”; and teaches that
          science and magick can work together. While seeking to spread his
          infamous philosophy of, “Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the
          Law,” Crowley becomes one of the most notorious figures of his day.<br />&nbsp;<br />Based
          on Richard Kaczynski’s twenty years of research, and including
          previously unpublished biographical
          details,&nbsp;<i>Perdurabo</i>&nbsp;paints a memorable portrait of the
          man who inspired the counterculture and influenced generations of
          artists, punks, wiccans, and other denizens of the demimonde.

        <p>
          “From a historical perspective, <i>Perdurabo</i> is the finest work on
          Crowley to date."<br />–Peter J. Morris, writer and blogger<br /><br />“Although
          there have been several authoritative (and relatively impartial) bios
          of the occultist Aleister Crowley published in the last decade, in my
          opinion there is one that is definitely a cut above the rest. This
          would be&nbsp;<i>Perdurabo</i>&nbsp;by Richard Kaczynski, PhD. As ‘The
          definitive biography of the founder of modern magick,’ Kaczynski's
          revised and expanded edition of his 2002 offering is tirelessly
          researched (20 years!), highly detailed and loaded with photos, many
          of which are quite rare.”<br />–Toolband.com, official website of rock
          band TOOL<br />&nbsp;<br />“Richard Kaczynski’s&nbsp;<i
            >Perdurabo: the Life of Aleister Crowley</i
          >&nbsp;is the one biography that is absolutely necessary for anyone
          who wishes to know more about one of the most creative, seminal, and
          misunderstood figures of the last hundred years.”<br />–David Tibet,
          founder of Current 93<br />&nbsp;<br />"A brilliant essayist, a
          superior poet, and an extraordinary artist, mountaineer, and explorer,
          the Crowley presented in these witty and erudite pages is at once
          shocking, wise, egocentric, petty, inspirational and, most
          importantly, real. Roundly rejecting the pantomime villain at the
          center of previous biographies and deeply suspicious of the
          nonsensical hero-worship of some of his modern followers, Kaczynski's
          portrait of Crowley is balanced and well-informed.”<br />–Paul Feazey,
          LAShTAL.com<br /><br />"<i>Perdurabo</i>&nbsp;is a magnificent
          biography not only on the colorful and fascinating figure himself, but
          on the occult, eastern religions, sexuality, and the attempt to apply
          the rigors of the scientific method to the so-called occult. Kaczynski
          does justice to Crowley’s life and thought, solidly placing him with
          other great spiritual development figures. Anybody who wants to learn
          about Crowley would enjoy this book, while more serious followers will
          appreciate the previously unpublished biographical details and
          photographs."<br />–<i>Sacramento Book Review</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“This is not only the most carefully-researched,
          detailed, and informative biography of Crowley yet written but also a
          remarkable insight into the nature of magic itself.”<br />–Ronald
          Hutton, author of&nbsp;<i>The Triumph of the Moon</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i
            >Blood and Mistletoe: The History of the Druids in Britain</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Several recently-published biographies of Crowley
          do justice, for the most part, to his life and works. But their
          offerings now stand like skeletal frames of unfinished houses next to
          Kaczynski’s magnificently constructed edifice. Every brick is set in
          place with the mortar of meticulous research and insight.”<br />–Lon
          Milo DuQuette, author of&nbsp;<i>The Magick of Aleister Crowley</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“At long last, the world has a balanced and
          readable biography that reflects how magick shaped every facet of
          Aleister Crowley’s life. And Dr. Kaczynski doesn’t dismiss magick as
          humbug or mumbo-jumbo but validates it as a legitimate method of
          spiritual development meriting serious study.”<br />–Christopher S.
          Hyatt, PhD, author of&nbsp;<i>Undoing Yourself</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Richard Kaczynski uses a novelist’s touch to make
          this exceptionally well-researched book read like an adventure story.
          For the serious student of Ceremonial magick or anyone curious about
          the truth behind all those weird stories, it’s essential reading.”<br /><i
