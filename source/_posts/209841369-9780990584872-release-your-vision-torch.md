            Release YOUR VISION TORCH, a Success Blueprint for Achieving Your
            Dreams, Igniting Your Vision, &amp; Re-engineering Your Purpose,
            part of YOUR VISION TORCH series is not a book! It is a system… an
            innovative program which is geared to help you move from where you
            are to where you ought to be. Therefore as an innovative system, it
            will require a lot of you…. It will insist that you be a participant
            in your own success journey…. It will push you to think, address,
            and confront issues you would ordinarily sweep under the rug.
            Release Your Vision Torch will demand you tell the truth, tear the
            veil, and unmask the hidden parts of you which have literally set
            you back for years! It will not indulge you but provide tools to
            help re-engineer your life purpose, rediscover or for some people
            discover your dream, fuel your vision, and ultimately liberate your
            inner genius.
