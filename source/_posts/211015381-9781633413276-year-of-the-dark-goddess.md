            >A guided journey of empowerment and healing through life’s
            difficult passages, with&nbsp;practical tools, including embodied
            rituals, writing prompts, seasonal self-care practices, and
            community creation.<br />
            &nbsp;</b
          ><br />
          The journey of&nbsp;the Dark Goddess is a natural part of any
          difficult rite of passage. These&nbsp;transitions are often thought of
          as negative—death of a loved one, job loss, home loss, chronic
          illness, divorce—but even so-called “happy” transitions, such as
          marriage, the birth of a child, or retirement, can come with
          unexpected instability, grief, and a need for integration. In our
          culture, we may often feel like we should "move on" or "get back to
          normal." In studying myth, however, we come to understand that the
          purpose of challenging life transformations is not positive or
          negative.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>Year of the Dark Goddess </i>provides an anchor and a
          roadmap for navigating the disorientation of life transformations and
          offers resources for embracing changes as initiations that strengthen
          us and make clear our purpose and power. The&nbsp;book is modeled on
          ancient rite-of-passage ceremonies and journeys to the underworld and
          is structured as a four-phase rite-of-passage process: Preparation,
          Separation from the Known, Transition-Initiation, and
          Return-Integration. The book provides readers with practical
          tools—embodied rituals, writing practice, seasonal self-care and
          community creation—to ground and empower positive transformations in
          times of challenging change.<br /><br />
          Readers may use the book as both a linear guide through the initiation
          year, or a nonlinear tool for structuring their own unique
          rite-of-passage journey. Readers are invited to create personal
          challenges, reframe their rite-of-passage through myth work and sacred
          art, and create a potent and effective rite of passage ceremony to
          integrate their change.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The self-initiation process in <i>Year of the Dark Goddess</i> follows
          a ceremonial year, each quarter section is structured with the
          following:An interactive brief of themes and objectives for the
          quarter, such as making an altar, writing with the ancestors, creating
          herbal infusions, and storytelling.A seasonal ceremony template
          appropriate to the rite-of-passage phase.A unique retelling of an
          ancient myth or fairy tale and instructions for deep myth work. These
          tales contain the formula for how to successfully navigate rites of
          passage, consciously and unconsciously.Journaling prompts for
          reflection and projection, making visible the initiation journey.
