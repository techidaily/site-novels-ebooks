            >Award-winning author and thought leader Dawson Church, Ph.D.,
            blends cutting-edge neuroscience with intense firsthand experience
            to show you how you can rewire your brain for happiness-starting
            right now.</i
          ><br /><br />Neural plasticity-the discovery that the brain is capable
          of rewiring itself-is now widely understood. But what few people have
          grasped yet is how quickly this is happening, how extensive brain
          changes can be, and how much control each of us has over the
          process.<br /><br />In<i> Bliss Brain,</i> famed researcher Dawson
          Church digs deep into leading-edge science, and finds stunning
          evidence of rapid and radical brain change. In just eight weeks of
          practice, 12 minutes a day, using the right techniques, we can produce
          measurable changes in our brains. These make us calmer, happier, and
          more resilient.<br /><br />When we cultivate these pleasurable states
          over time, they become traits. We don't just feel more blissful as a
          temporary state; the changes are literally hard-wired into our brains,
          becoming stable and enduring personality traits.<br /><br />The
          startling conclusions of Church's research show that neural remodeling
          goes much farther than scientists have previously understood, with
          stress circuits shriveling over time. Simultaneously, "The
          Enlightenment Circuit"-associated with happiness, compassion,
          productivity, creativity, and resilience-expands.<br /><br />During
          deep meditation, Church shows how "the 7 neurochemicals of ecstasy"
          are released in our brains. These include anandamide, a
          neurotransmitter that's been named "the bliss molecule" because it
          mimics the effects of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis. It
          boosts serotonin and dopamine; the first is an analog of psilocybin,
          the second of cocaine. He shows how cultivating these elevated
          emotional states literally produces a self-induced high.<br /><br />While
          writing <i>Bliss Brain,</i> Church went through a series of disasters,
          including escaping seconds ahead of a California wildfire that
          consumed his home and office and claimed 22 lives. The fire triggered
          a painful medical condition and a financial disaster. Through it all,
          Church steadily practiced the techniques of Bliss Brain while teaching
          them to thousands of other people. This book weaves his story of
          resilience into the fabric of neuroscience, producing a fascinating
          picture of just how happy we can make our brains, no matter what the
          odds.

          “This book is a masterwork by a meditation adept who is also a
          scientist. Dawson captivates the reader with unforgettable stories and
          leading-edge neuroscience that open the mind, warm the heart, and
          elevate the spirit. His eloquent descriptions of meditative ecstasy
          and fact-based explanations of what brings it about provide
          big-picture understanding of the evolution of consciousness. This book
          shines with lucidity and caring. It most convincingly beckons readers
          to the heights of human awareness.”<br />~ <b>Judith Pennington</b>,
          president, Institute for the Awakened Mind<br /><br />“This book is so
          superior to the dozens of popular books on meditation I’ve seen over
          the years that I want to shout about it from the rooftops! It will
          make a beautiful difference in people’s lives! I opened it with the
          skepticism that its ambitious title invites, and I completed it
          surprised by how many fascinating insights I’d come to about the topic
          of ‘bliss brain.’ At a minimum, readers who sense the potential
          benefits of meditation but feel they don’t have a sustainable bridge
          into its practice will have lost that excuse. Dawson Church has
          brilliantly synthesized the vast literature on the neural, behavioral,
          lifestyle, and subjective benefits of meditation. He then
          systematically applies the principles derived from this analysis and
          from the fruits of his 50-year journey as a practicing and sometimes
          struggling meditator in formulating a disarmingly simple program. But
          unlike most self-help programs, this one has been tested
          scientifically, and it reliably brings participants into states of
          consciousness and neurochemistry that previously required years of
          long, diligent practice. <i>Bliss Brain </i>is a potent and urgently
          needed antidote to a culture in turmoil.”<br />~
          <b>David Feinstein, PhD</b>, co-author of
          <i>The Energies of Love<br /><br /></i>“Science and love embrace in
          this incredible book. It’s more than a clear and inspiring description
          of how radically our brains change in response to spiritual
          experiences; it shows us how to master the evolutionary quirks that
          sidetrack us in our quest for enlightenment. From one of today’s most
          brilliant scientists and accomplished authors, <i>Bliss Brain</i> is a
          gift to us all.”<br />~ <b>Dianne Morrison</b>, president, Effective
          Action Consulting<br /><br />“This brilliant book is a road map for
          turning tragedy into bliss. In my many years of knowing Dawson Church,
          I’ve found him to be a beacon of positivity and joy, a living example
          of the values he teaches. His research into how meditation activates
          the happiness centers of the brain puts Bliss Brain within the reach
          of everyone. Dawson shows how you can grow resilience even in the face
          of great personal loss, using adversity to remodel your brain for
          bliss. This book will rock your world, and show you that happiness is
          truly achievable, no matter how far away it seems today.”<br />~
          <b>Lisa Garr</b>, host of <i>The Aware Show</i><br /><br />“Science
          has known for decades that the brain is changed by consciousness.
          Until now, we’ve never before had a truly practical guide showing how
          to put this knowledge to work. This comprehensive and accessible book
          integrates research from a dozen scientific fields and translates it
          for our everyday lives. It clearly shows us how to apply neural
          plasticity while giving us an evidence-based path to creating a happy,
          peaceful and resourceful brain. It’s a ‘must read.’”<br />~
          <b>Marilyn Schlitz, PhD</b>, Dean of Transpersonal Psychology,Sofia
          University<br /><br />“Stunning! <i>Bliss Brain </i>is a masterpiece
          of science, inspiration and possibility; opening doors to each one of
          us about what’s possible in our lives and unraveling the true meaning
          of human potential. I’ll be reading this again and again and sharing
          it with those I love!”<br />~ <b>Nick Ortner</b>, author of
          <i>The Tapping Solution<br /><br /></i>“As <i>The Secret </i>meets the
          scientist in Dawson’s work, the boundaries of what you’ve believed
          possible will be stretched far beyond your existing picture of
          reality.”<br />~ <b>Jack Canfield</b>, co-author of #1
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling Chicken Soup® series and featured
          teacher in <i>The Secret</i><br /><br />“The pace of change and the
          pressure to perform often leads professionals to the edge of burnout.
          The research in <i>Bliss Brain </i>shows that meditation provides an
          island of inner peace in a stressful world. It leads to massive
          increases in productivity, creativity, happiness, and problem solving
          ability. The techniques Dawson offers us provide us with the leverage
          to address the challenges confronting organizations and society. These
          are the secrets that make companies and teams thrive, both personally
          and professionally.”<br />~ <b>Dr. Ivan Misner</b>, founder of BNI and
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author<br /><br />“Accumulating
          evidence suggests that meditation training yields improved emotional
          regulation and enduring changes in brain function, even outside
          meditation sessions, both in clinical and non-clinical populations.
          Dawson Church succinctly reviews all the neural evidence to date in
          this comprehensive yet relatable book, and shows how all of us can
          achieve states of bliss through meditation. Beautifully interwoven is
          his own story of loss and heartache, and recovery and resilience. This
          is a MUST read for everyone from all walks of life.”<br />~
          <b>Associate Professor Peta Stapleton, PhD</b>, author of
          <i>The Science Behind Tapping</i><br /><br />“Four billion years of
          evolution have conditioned us to make safety &amp; survival our
          brain’s default Operating System. But now we’re in the midst of an
          epoch change in which Enlightenment is emerging as the new Operating
          System. We’re in the early stages of that transition and
          <i>Bliss Brain</i> is the catalyst we need to speed up the process. In
          this book you’ll find the precise instructions that science provides
          for reformatting your brain for lifetime happiness. Buy this book.
          You’ll be oh-so-very-glad you did.”<br />~ <b>Martin Rutte</b>,
