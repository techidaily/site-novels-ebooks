          <p>
            Sparks of genuine revelation are contained in many religions and
            esoteric systems. <i>Your Evolving Soul</i> declares that we’ve been
            graced with a new revelation for our time: the little-known
            <i>Urantia Book</i>, which has quietly sold over one million copies
            in a dozen languages. According to the author of this comparative
            analysis, the disclosures about self, soul, and spirit in the
            Urantia Revelation stand alone in their coherence and richness of
            detail. <i>Your Evolving Soul</i> is the first book to fully explain
            this advanced teaching for the ordinary reader, offering clarity and
            inspiration for those on <i>any</i> path.<br /><br />
            Belitsos compares the <i>Urantia Book</i>’s
            futuristic&nbsp;teachings about the&nbsp;threefold design of the
            human self-system&nbsp;to the models of selfhood proposed by many
            previous thinkers, ranging from from Plato and Saint Augustine to
            Carl Jung and Ken Wilber. He provides essential context for this
            discussion by illumining the relationship of the Urantia text to
            scientific psychology and to the world’s religions, with special
            emphasis on Christianity and Buddhism.
            <i>Your Evolving Soul</i> also provides an introduction to the
            cosmology, theology, and philosophy of the Urantia teaching, and
            reveals its many affinities with contemporary integral theory and
            modern theology.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Through his lucid interpretation of the Urantia Revelation, the
            author offers a model of the human self and soul to be tested,
            examined, and compared—not a finished truth to be accepted as
            doctrine. Readers of this book will discover a plausible hypothesis
            of how our evolving soul becomes an immortal vehicle of our true
            identity. They also learn how our soul-making decisions can lead to
            the development of a creative, loving, unified, and perfected
            personality, now and into the afterlife.

          "Not that often do 'new revelations' have an exegetist and polyglot
          who links them immediately to a pluralistic or integral developmental
          framework and lens. More often, they linger for years with other
          adherents believing they have a 'one and only way.' Belitsos gives the
          Urantia message a fortuitous leap by linking it immediately to the
          modern oeuvre of interspiritual and integral worldviews."
