            When the path ahead is dark, how can we keep from stumbling? How do
            we make our way with courage and dignity? "Inside each of us is an
            eternal light that I call 'the One Who Knows,'" writes Jack
            Kornfield. "Awakening to this wisdom can help us find our way
            through pain and suffering with grace and tenderness." For anyone
            seeking answers during a time of trial, he offers&nbsp;<i
              >A Lamp in the Darkness,</i
            >&nbsp;a program filled with spiritual and psychological insights,
            hope-giving stories, and special guided meditations for skillfully
            navigating life's inevitable storms.&nbsp;<br />The practices in
            this book are not positive thinking, quick fixes, or simplistic
            self-help strategies. They are powerful tools for doing "the work of
            the soul" to access our inner knowing and to embrace the fullness of
            our life experience. With regular practice, these teachings and
            meditations enable you to transform your difficulties into a guiding
            light for the journey ahead. Join Jack Kornfield as your trusted
            guide and friend as you explore:<br />Shared Compassion—a guided
            practice for planting the seeds of compassion and opening the heart
            to all that life bringsThe Earth Is My Witness—a meditation to
            establish firm footing in the midst of darkness, centered by a
            steady witnessing presenceThe Practice of Forgiveness—what Kornfield
            calls "the only medicine that can release us from the past and allow
            us to truly begin anew"The Temple of Healing—a guided visualization
            to meet your own inner healerEquanimity and Peace—a meditation for
            maintaining balance and acceptance regardless of the
            situation&nbsp;Just as it is certain that each life will include
            suffering, explains Kornfield, it is also true that in every moment
            there is the possibility of transcending your difficulties to
            discover the heart's eternal freedom. With&nbsp;<i
