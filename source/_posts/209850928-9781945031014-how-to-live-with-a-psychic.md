        <p><strong>From Amazon reviewers:</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I have discovered my psychic abilities recently and it isn't always
          easy for my wife. She is constantly worried that I'm acting strange
          and that something is wrong. This book has helped her understand what
          I'm experiencing. It has also helped me to talk about my abilities
          with the people I love."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I so appreciate the reminder that it's ok to maintain the
          'me'&nbsp;in relationships while still nurturing the 'we'&nbsp;with
          humor and compassion."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wonderful book giving background and definitions on many metaphysical
          terms and what to expect from the awakening person. Not only
          informative for the families of those awakening but for awakening
          individuals as well."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This well written, intelligent and even yes, realistic, book is
          fascinating and valuable. Neither my husband nor I have this amazing
          gift, but I have a feeling what I learned here will be very useful in
          terms of all kinds of interesting contrasts that come up for us as a
          couple."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Reed delivers exactly what the title implies...[Though] she is&nbsp;a
          trained professional in psychology,&nbsp;her writing is not overly
          academic, rather, it is very reader friendly. Living with a psychic
          and loving them through their journey takes tenacity, patience and
          understanding, not every marriage could survive the challenges. I look
          forward to another book from this author."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Reading Crystal's book and her own journey of how to deal with this
          and sharing some stories normalizes the subject and makes it more
          understandable."
