            >In <i>The Secret Therapy of Trees</i>, Marco Mencagli and Marco
            Nieri explore the relationship between plants and organisms, and
            illustrate how to benefit from nature's positive impact on our
            psychological and physical well-being.</b
          ><br /><br />Our connection to nature is deeply rooted in the history
          of our evolution. And yet, we have less contact with green space now
          than ever, and our stress and anxiety levels are at an all-time high.
          The Secret Therapy of Trees helps us rediscover the restorative value
          of our natural environment and presents the science behind green
          therapies like forest bathing and bioenergetic landscapes, explaining
          which are the most effective and how to put them into practice to
          achieve the best possible results. <br /><br />Studies have shown that
          increased exposure to green space can result in a regulated heartbeat,
          lowered blood pressure, reduced aggressiveness, improved memory skills
          and cognitive function, and a healthier immune system. Just one visit
          to a forest can bring positive effects (hint: monoterpenes, the
          natural essential oils in plants, have numerous positive effects on
          health), and even a mindful walk through a semi natural park can
          alleviate physical and psychological stress. <br /><br />With multiple
          studies backing its findings and thorough explanations for each
          technique, The Secret Therapy of Trees is a treasure trove of tips on
          how to harness the regenerative power of plants and reconnect with our
          planet's natural spaces, bringing us health and happiness.
          <br /><br />You'll also discover:<br />* Which plants purify the
          environment at home and in the office<br />* The benefits of negative
          ions and where to find them<br />* How to recharge through contact
          with trees
