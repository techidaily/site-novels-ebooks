              >From a progressive faith leader,&nbsp;a collection of short
              devotions bearing witness&nbsp;to the first year of the COVID-19
              pandemic.</b
            ><br /><br />
            When the world went into lockdown in March 2020, spiritual leader
            Micah Bucey found himself in desperate need of prayer. While social
            distancing created disconnect, Bucey began a daily practice of
            writing a “Tiny Prayer” each morning and posting it on social media.
            Soon, a solitary practice became a communal one, with others
            engaging and sharing the prayers that touched them most, creating
            connection across a digital divide.<br /><br />
            Over the course of a year filled with fear and faith, protest and
            possibility, Bucey composed prayers for frontline workers and
            activists, those lost to illness, as well as wins for democracy.
            Collecting all 366 poems in one volume,&nbsp;<i
              >The Book of Tiny Prayer</i
            >&nbsp;recalls a very particular year, but its spirit is universal,
            inviting us all to get quiet, name the pain and the joy around us,
            and recommit to the change required for collective liberation,
            during difficult times and far beyond.<br /><br />
            “These tiny prayers from Micah Bucey’s big heart add up to something
            far larger than first meets the eye. In the midst of fear, grief,
            and continuing injustices, these are sincere expressions of the
            desire to dream God’s dream, with the power to center us, comfort
            us, ground us, and galvanize us.” ---The Rev. Dr. Jacqui Lewis,
            Senior Minister, Middle Collegiate Church and author,&nbsp;<i

          “Just as one tiny speck of glitter lights up an entire face, each of
          these radiant tiny prayers sparkles with huge hope. They are jewels of
          honest introspection, poetic gifts born of a year of turmoil,
          collected as a trail of glitter crumbs, lighting up our way back home
          to the soul.” —Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, Founding Spiritual Leader of
          Lab/Shul<br /><br />
          “Prayer changes things; this was central to my childhood faith
          training. And the older I get, the more the world turns in ways that
          cause me deep concern, the more I believe it to be true. These tiny
          prayers from Micah Bucey’s big heart add up to something far larger
          than first meets the eye. In the midst of fear, grief, and continuing
          injustices, these are sincere expressions of the desire to dream God’s
          dream, with the power to center us, comfort us, ground us, and
          galvanize us for the sacred work we must be doing in order to heal our
          souls and the world. This collection is a very specific record of a
          very specific year, but the sense of yearning and hope will inspire
          lives of love and justice for years to come.” —The Rev. Dr. Jacqui
          Lewis, Senior Minister, Middle Collegiate Church and author,

          “Perhaps tiny words are best to describe this book. Beautiful. Honest.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Micah Bucey</b> serves as Minister at Judson Memorial Church in
          Greenwich Village, a congregation committed to curiously seeking the
          intersections between expansive spirituality, radical social justice,
          and uncensored creative expression. Bucey has also served as
          Multifaith Coordinator for the New Sanctuary Coalition of New York
          City and is a regular contributor to
          <i>Spirituality &amp; Practice</i>. In his time at Judson, Bucey
          developed and continues to oversee “Judson Arts,” which has
          commissioned, presented, produced, and promoted the creative output of
          hundreds of poets, actors, playwrights, composers, musicians, dancers,
          choreographers, painters, photographers, sculptors, and many others,
          upholding the belief that artists have the potential to serve as
          society’s modern-day prophets. Learn more at micahbucey.com.<br /><br /><b
