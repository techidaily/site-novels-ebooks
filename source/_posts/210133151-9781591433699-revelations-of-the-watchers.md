          • Explains how the new Atlantis was rebuilt using ancient Lemurian
          construction techniques and how Poseidon was put in charge by
          nefarious Prince Caligastia <br /><br />• Explores the rise of
          shamanism, the hidden history of Akhenaten, and the privileged role of
          the Yazidi people in the spiritual evolution of the planet
          <br /><br />• Exposes how our planet is one of the worlds on which the
          rebel angels have been the accorded the privilege of a mortal
          incarnation <br /><br />During the angelic rebellion 203,000 years
          ago, which led to the quarantine of Earth and 36 other planets from
          the Multiverse, Georgia, an angel of Seraphic status, aligned herself
          with Lucifer and the rebel angels. After the rebellion, Georgia was
          permitted to remain on this planet and become a Watcher. Writing
          together with Timothy Wyllie, in this book Georgia provides her
          personal account of Earth during the second rise of Atlantis.
          <br /><br />Georgia explains how the new Atlantis was home to the few
          surviving Lemurians and was rebuilt using ancient Lemurian
          construction techniques. She reveals how Prince Caligastia put
          Poseidon in charge of the new Atlantis in order to keep him from
          interfering with the Prince’s imposition of monotheism in southern
          Palestine. She explores the rise of shamanism through the entheogenic
          use of power plants -- first on the Islands of Mu, then in the Nile
          Valley, and later among the Aborigines of Australia. She also looks at
          the hidden history of Pharaoh Akhenaten and the privileged role of the
          Yazidi people in the spiritual evolution of the planet--and how even
          today the attempts to extinguish their culture is the work of
          Caligastia’s agents. <br /><br />Interwoven with Georgia’s narrative
          of Earth’s ancient history are her observations of Timothy Wyllie’s
          current and previous lives, including his involvement with the Process
          Church, his struggle to leave it, and his spiritual activities after
          he left. Through her revelations, Georgia exposes the supreme
          significance of Earth in the larger Multiverse and how our planet is
          one of the worlds on which the rebel angels have been accorded the
          privilege of a mortal incarnation. Georgia shares her words, in part,
          to awaken the 100 million rebel angels currently living their human
          lives. She reveals how a mortal incarnation for a rebel angel is an
          opportunity to redeem their past and help prepare for the imminent
          transformation of consciousness as the rebel-held planets, including
          Earth, are welcomed back into the Multiverse.

          “Timothy Wyllie’s mammoth reconfiguration of humankind’s imprinted
          perceptions rips apart concepts and questions, dissolving the
          mysterious shadow worlds and interlaced realms of science to
          brilliantly expose its reluctant but imminent surrender to strings of
          holographic universes he calls the Multiverse.”
