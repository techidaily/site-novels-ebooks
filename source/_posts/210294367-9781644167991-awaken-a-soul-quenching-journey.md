            As we come across people in our lives, at our schools, at the store,
            even in our churches, they may seem like their lives are perfect and
            everything is going well. However, this is often not the case and
            things are not as they seem. When you peel back the layers of life
            and go under the surface, you find out what they are actually going
            through. I was one of those people. When you looked at me you would
            have thought my life was great. Though I had a great childhood,
            loving family, and safe home, the actual events of my life would
            take me down a path far from what I experienced in my childhood. My
            story and path through life show what really can go on beneath the
            surface. Pain, bad decisions, anxiety, assault, abuse, fear,
            divorce, all ultimately become part of my life's story. My journey
            through this thing we call life would take me through it all. At
            times, I would wonder if I would be able to make it through
            everything? After all that happened what was the purpose? Would I
            ever be able to make sense of the mess and find a calling in my
            life?As I made bad decisions, endured terrible hardships, got
            entangled in difficult relationships, I had to figure out how to
            navigate these circumstances. More importantly, I had to learn to
            not lose faith in the midst of it all. I had to learn to reassure
            myself that God had a plan for me and eventually the dusk would turn
            to dawn. If I had not learned to hear that still, small voice in the
            back of my head and trust in God's plan, I may not be here today to
            tell you this story.
