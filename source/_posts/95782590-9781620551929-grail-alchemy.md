          An experiential guide to the spiritual path of the Holy Grail <br />
          <br />• Traces the evolution of the Holy Grail from the sacred vessel
          of the Celtic goddess to the Cup of Christ and how it represents the
          longing for the divine feminine <br />
          <br />• Provides exercises, meditations, and rituals to connect you
          with the powers of the Cauldron of Rebirth, the Chalice of Healing,
          the Sword of Light, and the Holy Grail <br />
          <br />• Explains how attaining the Grail brings full consciousness of
          the soul and Divine influence for the healing of self and others
          <br />
          <br />The primary myth of Western culture, the quest for the Holy
          Grail persists through the centuries like a recurring dream, embodying
          the longing for the divine feminine suppressed for more than two
          thousand years. The Holy Grail emerged not only as a symbol of the
          feminine but also as a symbol of the soul, for hidden within the
          sacred Grail legends lies an initiatory path that leads to the highest
          realms of consciousness and spiritual illumination. By working with
          the symbols of the Grail tradition we can gaze into our own hidden
          depths and heal the separation between masculine and feminine, Spirit
          and Matter, and Heaven and Earth. <br />
          <br />Mara Freeman traces the evolution of the Grail from the sacred
          vessel of the Celtic goddess to the Cup of Christ, revealing a
          spiritual path rooted in the mysteries of the Goddess, the Grail, and
          the Sword. She explains how the Sword has dominated over the Goddess
          and the Grail for far too long, leading to a spiritual wasteland as
          foretold in the Grail stories. She provides a practical workbook of
          exercises, visualizations, and magical rituals to restore the power of
          the divine feminine through spiritually transformative experiences
          with the Cauldron of Rebirth, the Chalice of Healing, the Sword of
          Light, and the Holy Grail itself. <br />
          <br />Drawing on folk traditions and medieval Arthurian romances as
          well as alchemy and the wisdom of the mystics of Glastonbury, Freeman
          reveals the ancient Celtic teachings of the Western Mystery tradition.
          She shows that attaining the Grail involves achieving full
          consciousness of the soul. Then, as a Grail-bearer, you can bring the
          light of the Grail into the world for the healing of self and others.
