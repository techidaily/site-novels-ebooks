          Our origins as a slave species and the Anunnaki legacy in our DNA
          <br />
          <br />• Reveals compelling new archaeological and genetic evidence for
          the engineered origins of the human species, first proposed by
          Zecharia Sitchin in The 12th Planet <br />
          <br />• Shows how the Anunnaki created us using pieces of their own
          DNA, controlling our physical and mental capabilities by inactivating
          their more advanced DNA <br />
          <br />• Identifies a recently discovered complex of sophisticated
          ruins in South Africa as the city of the Anunnaki leader Enki <br />
          <br />Scholars have long believed that the first civilization on Earth
          emerged in Sumer some 6,000 years ago. However, as Michael Tellinger
          reveals, the Sumerians and Egyptians inherited their knowledge from an
          earlier civilization that lived at the southern tip of Africa and
          began with the arrival of the Anunnaki more than 200,000 years ago.
          Sent to Earth in search of life-saving gold, these ancient Anunnaki
          astronauts from the planet Nibiru created the first humans as a slave
          race to mine gold--thus beginning our global traditions of gold
          obsession, slavery, and god as dominating master. <br />
          <br />Revealing new archaeological and genetic evidence in support of
          Zecharia Sitchin’s revolutionary work with pre-biblical clay tablets,
          Tellinger shows how the Anunnaki created us using pieces of their own
          DNA, controlling our physical and mental capabilities by inactivating
          their more advanced DNA--which explains why less than 3 percent of our
          DNA is active. He identifies a recently discovered complex of
          sophisticated ruins in South Africa, complete with thousands of mines,
          as the city of Anunnaki leader Enki and explains their lost
          technologies that used the power of sound as a source of energy.
          Matching key mythologies of the world’s religions to the Sumerian clay
          tablet stories on which they are based, he details the actual events
          behind these tales of direct physical interactions with “god,”
          concluding with the epic flood--a perennial theme of ancient
          myth--that wiped out the Anunnaki mining operations. <br />
          <br />Tellinger shows that, as humanity awakens to the truth about our
          origins, we can overcome our programmed animalistic and slave-like
          nature, tap in to our dormant Anunnaki DNA, and realize the longevity
          and intelligence of our creators as well as learn the difference
          between the gods of myth and the true loving God of our universe.
