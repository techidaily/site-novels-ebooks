            The Holy Grail legend strikes a deep chord for many, calling us like
            a moth to light. In these groundbreaking communications, Yeshua
            (Jesus) and Mary Magdalene tell us why. More than a myth, THE HOLY
            GRAIL is sacred knowledge, revealing the heart of our spiritual
            journey on Earth. Yeshua and Mary Magdalene compassionately unveil
            the meaning of the Holy Grail, showing us the path of the Sacred
            Masculine and Divine Feminine. For those called to higher
            consciousness and love, THE HOLY GRAIL is a guide star. The latest
            in The Magdalene-Yeshua Teaching Series of universal wisdom from
            award-winning author Mercedes Kirkel.

            "As an observer of psychic phenomena over many years, I do believe
            that Mercedes's channeling is genuine and that Mercedes is
            overshadowed in the trance state by real beings who call themselves
            Yeshua and Mary Magdalene. When I listened to this channeling, I was
            blown away." -Dr. Lorenzo da Costa, M.D.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "A most profound revelation of what the Holy Grail is-shining a
            light on the complementary roles of Magdalene love and Christ
            consciousness. This is a call to humanity for our individual and
            collective spiritual evolution." -Robert "Han" Bishop, PhD, host,
            "Transforming Reality Talk Show"

            it and read it again, for each chapter contains a gem of wisdom and
            inspiration." -Ton Van der Kroon, men's work pioneer and author, The
            Return of the King

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "This seminal work offers many secrets about the nature of reality,
            Christ Consciousness, and beyond. These teachings from Yeshua and
            Mary Magdalene help us to understand more about ourselves, each
            other, and the divine so we may walk in their footsteps-fully human
            and fully divine." -Dr. Melissa Sophia Joy, ND, founder, Sophia
            Healing Academy and Somatic Awakening
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "This is an amazing book! The Holy Grail brings the Sacred Masculine
            and Divine Feminine together in a way that will truly mesmerize the
            serious reader. Be prepared to learn and grow spiritually." -Ronald
            Tobin, bestselling author and spiritual counselor
          </p>

          <p>
            "A roadmap to humanity's higher octaves, where our collective Sacred
            Masculine will indeed unite with the Divine Feminine." -Sheil
            Seclearr, filmmaker, "The Water Clock"
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "These profound messages bring new information about the Divine
            Feminine and Masculine. I think it's important that this is brought
            to the world at this time." -Jacqueline de Rond, clinical
            psychologist, "Awakening the Illuminated Heart" workshop leader
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "The revelation of the true meaning of the Holy Grail is far richer
            and more beautiful than any of the mythical and mystical
            explanations presented hitherto, warming my heart and touching the
            deeper recesses of my soul. I highly recommend this book." -Anant
            Akash, PhD, psychologist
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "As a man who's been doing spiritual work and men's work for nearly
            forty years (and by the way, a channeling skeptic), I say without
            hesitation that every man should read this book. What you will find
            here is an understanding of the seeming conflict between the
            Masculine and Feminine, how to honor the polarity that is who and
            what we are divinely ordained to embody, and how that polarity is
            destined to fuel our ascension to our true source. This book is an
            opportunity not to be wasted." -Stan Eads,
