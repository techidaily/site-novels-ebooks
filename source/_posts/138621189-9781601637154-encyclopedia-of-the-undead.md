          <p>What lurks out there in the fog?</p>
          <p>What was that eerie sound in the dead of night?</p>
          <p>
            What flitted by at the end of the street, just beyond the farthest
            street lamp?
          </p>
          <p>
            From earliest times, tales of the restless dead and their fellow
            travelers have terrified mankind. Whether around a remote campfire
            or in the middle of a bustling city, the unquiet spirits and
            attendant creatures that have tormented humanity since the
            prehistoric darkness haven’t gone away—they still have the power to
            strike fear in our hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Encyclopedia of the Undead</i> traces those shadowy
            entities—vampires, werewolves, ghouls and monsters—that lurk just
            outside the range of human vision and inhabit our most frightening
            tales. Drawing on a wide range of beliefs and literature, it traces
            these horrors from their earliest recorded inceptions and charts
            their impact upon the human psyche. In this book, history and terror
            mix to create the things that lurk in the darkest corners of our
            minds.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll find detailed descriptions of terrors from all over the
            world—from the mist-shrouded mountains of Eastern Europe to the
            sweltering jungles of the Caribbean islands, from the dark,
            stone-lined tombs of the uncoffined dead beneath the remote New
            England hills to the dark magics that lurk beneath the thriving,
            colorful surface of a city like New Orleans. In addition to the more
            conventional creatures, Encyclopedia of the Undead also details some
            of the more obscure Things that gnaw at the edges of men’s
            minds—Incubi and Succubi, the Mara, and the dark legends that have
            influenced writers from Sheridan Le Fanu to H.P. Lovecraft.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a book for all those who are interested in the darker side
            of the human mind—the side that examines and even embraces those
            beliefs and imaginings that form the basis of our most archetypical
            fears. This is the book for those brave enough to plumb the depths
            of our worst nightmares!
