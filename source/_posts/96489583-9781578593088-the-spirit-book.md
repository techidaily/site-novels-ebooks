            The fascinating history of Spiritualism is coaxed into the material
            realm as the object of this perceptive and sweeping overview by that
            legendary author of the occult and supernatural, Raymond Buckland.
            Drawing on decades of research, writing, and transcendence, he
            describes sundry methods of channeling, events associated with
            Spiritualism, including séances and exorcism, organizations focused
            on clairvoyance, and a colorful host of mortals—famous and
            infamous—who delved into Spiritualism. Nostradamus, Helena
            Blavatsky, and Edgar Cayce receive their due, as well as Joan of
            Arc, William Blake, Susan B. Anthony, Winston Churchill, Arthur
            Conan Doyle, Mahatma Gandhi, Harry Houdini, and Mae West (look up
            and see her sometime).

        </h4>
        <p>
          As one of the world's foremost experts on the occult and Wicca
          practices, Raymond Buckland studied and practiced fortune telling,
          Witchcraft, Gypsy magic, and other aspects of the supernatural for
          more than half a century. Of Romany (Gypsy) descent, Buckland was born
          in London in 1934. He obtained a doctorate in anthropology and, in
          1962, moved to America. His spiritual quest led him to the works of
          Wicca pioneer Dr. Gerald Gardner. Before long, Buckland began serving
          as Gardner's spokesperson in the United States and was initiated into
          the Craft shortly before Gardner's death in 1964.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had nearly 40 titles published, including
          <i>The Witch Book, The Fortune-Telling Book,</i> and the classic
          <i>Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft.</i> Buckland was also the
          subject of and had written countless newspaper and magazine articles,
          appeared on many television and radio shows, and lectured on college
          campuses nationwide.
