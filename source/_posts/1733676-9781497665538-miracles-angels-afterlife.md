            >A compelling account of years of spiritual investigations from the
            director of <i>Life After Life</i>, the award-winning documentary on
            near-death experiences<i>.</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          The stories of divine intervention in people’s everyday lives
          continued to occupy Peter Shockey’s thoughts even after his
          documentaries on the subject for Hallmark Channel and Discovery’s TLC
          had been completed and garnered awards and international acclaim.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>Miracles, Angels &amp; Afterlife</i>, Shockey shares the most
          compelling accounts he has gathered during his years of spiritual
          investigations and offers profound insight into what the increasing
          presence of the divine in daily life can mean in this, the first
          generation of the third millennium.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Beginning with his own personal story, Shockey goes on to introduce
          others who relate their miraculous experiences, ranging from visions
          of heaven to the presence of angels.&nbsp;He then puts these
          encounters in an enlightening context as he explores striking patterns
          of divine intervention in human history as well as in the Bible. In
          doing so, he takes readers on an unforgettable spiritual odyssey that
          will change the way they look at the here and now . . . and the
          hereafter.
