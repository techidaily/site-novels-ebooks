            >A heartfelt call and primer for community-oriented models of
            wellbeing in our age of polarization and turmoil.</b
          ><br /><br /><br />Creating compassionate communities takes more than
          good will—it requires a dedication to respecting cultural differences
          while remembering the fundamental spiritual kinship that exists
          between all people. Activist, counselor, and Buddhist teacher Ayo
          Yetunde creatively unpacks this condition through the metaphor of
          Indra’s Net—a universal net in which all beings reflect each other
          like jewels.<br /><br />
          She offers a practice path that acknowledges our deep
          challenges—challenges that increasingly give rise to the temptation of
          group violence, which she calls <i>mobbery</i>—while showing exactly
          how we can still listen, learn, and heal together. Drawing inspiration
          from the Black liberation tradition and from stories from various
          religions, Yetunde recasts Indra’s Net as the network in which we all
          have the choice either to succumb to our impulses toward division and
          brutality or renew our civility and love for each other. The more than
          20 practices in <i>Casting Indra’s Net </i>include:&nbsp;<br /><br />
          Five commitments for healthy, nonviolent living&nbsp;Guided

          “<i>Casting Indra’s Net</i> is an enthralling plea for kinship and
          care. Offering life experiences and her refined theologian mind,
          Yetunde supports us in a thorough investigation of nonviolence in
          service of self-actualization and social harmony. Pithy and wise,
          <i>Casting Indra’s Net</i> warms the chill of our troubling times,
          softening us into wholeness.”—Ruth King, author of
          <i>Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out</i> and
          Founder of the Mindful of Race Institute<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “For anyone looking for a way forward in the face of incessant
          polarization and violence in our global community,
          <i>Casting Indra’s Net</i> is a call to compassionate action
          cultivated in deep introspection and contemplation. Through
          thought-provoking personal narratives, social analysis, and an
          exploration of sacred texts and the lives of religious exemplars, Dr.
          Ayo Yetunde weaves a colorful tapestry inviting us to do the necessary
          inner work to live as spiritual kin, caring for one another amidst
          global crises and suffering.”—Rev. Dr. Alisha Tatem, Program Director
          of Congregational Leaders at the Institute for Islamic, Christian and
          Jewish Studies<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Ayo’s bravely compassionate book casts us into a net of mutuality—and
          brings us up whole. <i>Casting Indra’s Net</i> invites us to be
          remade, as by a home-cooked meal you didn’t know you needed, prepared
          by kin you mistook for strangers. This book is a gem that mirrors the
          jeweled possibilities&nbsp;in all of us.”—Chenxing Han, author of
          <i>Be the Refuge: Raising the Voices of Asian American Buddhists</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “With clarity and compassion, using powerful storytelling and wise
          inquiry, Pamela Ayo Yetunde expertly guides us to understand the
          indelible truth of our interconnection as kinship. Carefully and
          bravely leading us to comprehend the urgency of our social, political,
          and environmental crises, <i>Casting Indra’s Net</i> is a poignant cry
          to release any divisiveness and heed the call of religious teachings
          and leaders throughout time that ultimately only love heals. Weaving
          together Buddhist practices with Christian and Jewish parables, Hindu
          thought, and universal gospel, this book is a compelling and practical
          guide for our challenging times.”—Sebene Selassie, author of
          <i>You Belong: A Call for Connection</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Living in a society that is so painfully divided across polarized
          beliefs, it is all too easy to dismiss folks who hold differing
          viewpoints and whom we perceive as ignorant or even threatening. In
          <i>Casting Indra’s Net</i>, Pamela Ayo Yetunde beautifully reminds us
          that, in truth, we are interdependent kin, and deep within our cores
          we have the gifts of respect and compassion to exchange with one
          another. Weaving together wisdom traditions, especially Buddhism, with
          the author’s penetrating insights and stories, this book offers
          skillful means for remembering that we are the beloveds of all
          sentient beings.”—Jeanine Canty, author of
          <i
            >Returning the Self to Nature: Undoing Our Collective Narcissism and
            Healing Our Planet</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Pamela Ayo Yetunde draws on the deep wisdom traditions of Buddhism
          and the Black experience in America to offer us the truth of mutuality
          and interdependence the world needs so badly at this time.”—Melvin
          McLeod, Editor-in-Chief, <i>Lion’s Roar</i> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “We live in tumultuous and often ugly times. If you want to help make
          things better, and make yourself happier in the process, check out
          Ayo’s book. It’s easy to feel separate, like you’re an isolated ego
          peering fretfully out at the world. But this is an illusion—one that
          leads to hatred and unhappiness. This book might help wake you up from
          this nightmare. It’s a rallying cry for civility—to start repairing
          the world, and ourselves.”—Dan Harris, author of <i>10% Happier</i
          ><br />
          <i> </i><br />
          “In <i>Casting Indra’s Net</i>, Ayo Yetunde draws on her rich
          experience to apply spiritual practice (much of it Buddhist) to the
          contemporary tragedy of what she calls ‘mobbery’—our collective
          failure to address human problems and instead fall back into
          resentment, tribalism, and violence. With a calm yet insistent voice,
          she introduces refreshing new concepts like the ‘Platinum Rule’ (an
          updated Golden Rule that takes difference into account) and ‘koanic’
          thinking (an extension of the Zen koan tradition), while providing
          fresh readings of traditional texts from several religions. All this
          in service of developing a renewed sense of civility that refuses to
          settle for complacency in an unjust world. This is a challenging and
          courageous book.”—Norman Fischer, author of
          <i
            >When You Greet Me I Bow: Notes and Reflections from a Life in
            Zen</i
          >
          and <i>Selected Poems: 1980–2013</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “From the depths of our sorrows, Pamela Ayo Yetunde speaks with a
          prophetic voice—wise, clear, and passionate. The righteousness she
          invokes is the call of love and mutuality rather than warning and
          wrath. Toward that end, Ayo’s book offers practices to accomplish the
          oneness of compassion and justice in this very real world we inhabit.
          We need both.”—Hozan Alan Senauke, author of
          <i>Turning Words: Transformative Encounters with Buddhist Teachers</i>
          and abbot of Berkeley Zen Center<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Casting Indra’s Net</i> is not just a book. It is a deeply
          compassionate tour of our interbeing—and a clear and vibrant call to
          live into it.”—from the foreword by Resmaa Menakem, author of
          <i
            >My Grandmother’s Hands: Racialized Trauma and the Pathway to
            Mending Our Hearts and Bodies</i
          ><br />
          <i> </i><br />
          “This lovely text is a contribution to Interfaith America—the chapter
          of American history that I believe we are starting to write. But Ayo’s
          vision, I suspect, is even larger. She would say that this is a stitch
          in the fabric of Interfaith World.”—from the afterword by Eboo Patel,
          author of <i>We Need to Build: Field Notes for Diverse Democracy</i
          ><br />
          <i> </i><br />
          “Ayo's offering is anchored in her own human story and rooted in her
          interpretations of Buddhist tradition and astute analysis of our
          present politics. With her book's two core images (drawn from ancient
          stories) of all of our souls as interconnected nodes in a vast cosmic
          net, and the garlands of fragrant flowers or bloody fingers that we
          make for ourselves as each of our actions contributes to mutuality or
          to mobbery, Ayo weaves an authentic invitation to all of us to draw on
          her reflection and teaching—and on the stories and practices each of
          us has inherited, lived, and encountered—to be our most fully present
          and compassionate selves, in kinship with all beings.
          <i>Casting Indra's Net</i> is not meant to live in its pages—it is an
          offering of orientation and practice, asking all of us to live into
          the world Ayo envisions and invites us to cocreate. This book is
          already a river with many tributaries, with Ayo's ancestors in thought
          and practice alive and with her in its pages. Where it will go depends
          on how we, her readers, answer her question, ‘What part do you want to
          play?’”—Rabbi Emma Kippley-Ogman, Associate Chaplain for Jewish Life,
          Macalester College<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Pamela Ayo Yetunde’s evocative and luminous work centers in the
          relational mutuality that beckons every human heart. She shows how
          this mutuality opens to the mysterious depth of reality and is the
          living key to personal and social transformation in our highly
          polarized times. Her unmistakably deep roots in the radical Buddhist
          praxis of unrestricted loving-kindness give her the heart to hold
          genuine differences and navigate divisions while fostering solidarity
          of relational caring. She teaches us to advance shared flourishing
          across the full ‘community of being’ in its interrelationship with
          sacred mystery.”—Dr. William F. Vendley, Vice President, World
          Religions and Spirituality, Fetzer Institute<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Thank you, Ayo Yetunde, for writing this book! The jewel of your
          perspective sees with nuance, care, and clear knowing of the potential
          for all of us to see more fully. This is a call for the committed work
          of civility. Through touching personal stories, letters, and
          practices, we are invited to move, to act, to reflect, and to remember
          how to lean in to support the good that we know is in each of
          us.”—Peace Twesigye, Assistant Director of Buddhist Studies and the
          Thich Nhat Hanh Program for Engaged Buddhism at Union Theological
          Seminary
