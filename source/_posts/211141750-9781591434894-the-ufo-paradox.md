          • Looks at witnesses’ reports as well as the theories of skeptics,
          revealing how UFOs represent a call from the cosmos to expand our
          understanding of reality<br /><br />• Explores UFO encounters against
          the backdrop of visionary experience—angelic visitations, near-death
          experiences, shamanic journeys, and religious miracles<br /><br />•
          Shares the author’s UFO discussions with late Harvard psychiatrist
          John Mack, philanthropist Laurance S. Rockefeller, and astronaut Edgar
          Mitchell<br /><br />In case after case related to UFO encounters and
          other unknown aerial phenomena (UAP), the same impasse is reached:
          testimony from witnesses on one side, dismissive responses from the
          authorities on the other. In the fertile void of this deadlock,
          however, lie extraordinary possibilities about the nature of mind and
          matter, spirit and soul, transforming the UFO into a celestial,
          metaphysical event.<br /><br />Focusing on the possibilities found by
          exploring both sides of the UFO debate, veteran UFO observer and
          reporter Keith Thompson shares profound insights and experiences from
          his several decades of research, revealing that the UFO phenomenon is
          decidedly real yet perhaps not what either side of the debate expects.
          He looks at UFOs as a genuine unknown, from outer space or manifesting
          from hidden dimensions, as well as the theories of skeptics and
          debunkers who insist that UFOs can be explained as hoaxes,
          hallucinations, or misidentified phenomena. He explores the modern
          flying saucer era against the backdrop of visionary experience—angelic
          visitations, near-death experiences, shamanic journeys, religious
          miracles, and fairy tales—and shows how UFOs are simultaneously
          physical and spiritual, presenting a form of intelligence capable of
          altering the perceptions of witnesses.<br /><br />Chronicling his own
          investigations into the UFO mystery, the author details how he
          introduced the late Harvard psychiatrist John Mack to accounts of
          alien abduction and how he was invited by philanthropist Laurance S.
          Rockefeller to lobby then-president Bill Clinton to disclose
          government-held UFO information. Sharing stories from his friendship
          with astronaut Edgar D. Mitchell, among others, the author recounts
          discussions on how best to interpret UFOs and non-ordinary phenomena
          of various kinds.<br /><br />Thompson reveals how the UFO phenomenon
          ultimately represents a call from the cosmos for humanity to open to
          greater dimensions of reality and recognize that our understanding of
          the universe is still far from complete.
