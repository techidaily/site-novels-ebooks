              >USA TODAY BESTSELLER<br /><br />Unlock your infinite potential in
              every area of your life and become your own inspiration.</b
            ><br /><br />Using the concept of Light as a tool for personal and
            spiritual growth, bestselling author and entrepreneur Jessica Zweig
            challenges readers to hit the proverbial “light switch" and
            illuminate their own lives. Rooted in the Pleiadian teachings of
            Light as “Information,” “Truth,” and “Love,” Jessica’s philosophy
            teaches readers to name, claim, and reframe their inner darkness in
            order to unlock their infinite potential and remember who they truly
            are.<br /><br />Jessica Zweig is the founder of a
            multimillion-dollar business, a bestselling author, and a social
            media phenomenon—but her path was not an easy one.
            <i>The Light Work </i>distills the highly-evolved spiritual concepts
            she learned along the way into practical applications, delivered
            with Jessica’s signature straight-talk. How-to’s, exercises, and
            journal prompts interweave with Jessica’s powerful personal story to
            create a guidebook to a more inclusive, loving, and Light-filled
            life.<br /><br />Within these pages lies radical self-empowerment,
            because—as Jessica says—when you can claim all parts of yourself
            (your dark and your light, your power and your shame, your sh*t
            <i>and </i>your shine), you become… unstoppable. You become the
            Lightworker.
