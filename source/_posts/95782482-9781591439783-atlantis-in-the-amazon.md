          An investigation into the ancient technologically advanced artifacts
          amassed by Father Carlo Crespi and how they offer proof of Atlantis in
          South America <br />
          <br />• Includes photos and descriptions of the strange machines and
          beautiful artifacts that once comprised the “Crespi Treasure” <br />
          <br />• Connects Crespi’s treasures to readings by Edgar Cayce and
          Annie Besant’s descriptions of Atlantean colonies in Ecuador <br />
          <br />• Reveals the nuclear war between the Atlanteans and the Aryans
          and the radioactive evidence left behind in the Bahamas and Pakistan
          <br />
          <br />In 1923 an Italian priest, Father Carlo Crespi, came to Ecuador
          as a missionary. Befriending the indigenous Shuar people, he learned
          of an ancient treasure they had sworn to protect hidden within a
          network of underground tunnels. As newly converted Christians, the
          Shuar wanted to share with their priest these amazing anachronistic
          artifacts--golden sarcophagi from Egypt, bronze plaques depicting
          famous scenes from antiquity bearing both Quechua and Phoenician
          writing, copper wheels and gears as hard as steel, strange machines,
          and many other inexplicable items. Crespi faithfully maintained the
          collection until just before his death when the Ecuadorian government
          purchased it from the church and many of these priceless treasures
          were lost forever. <br />
          <br />Providing detailed descriptions and his own photos of the
          advanced technologies and beautiful art that comprised the “Crespi
          Treasure,” Richard Wingate reveals that the ancient civilization
          responsible for these advanced artifacts was Atlantis. Connecting
          Crespi’s treasures to Edgar Cayce’s descriptions of advanced
          technology in the distant past and the Atlantean colonies of Ecuador
          described by Annie Besant, Wingate explores other evidence of Atlantis
          in South America and the Bahamas, including geographically
          out-of-place underwater ruins and buried magnetic ore. Investigating
          ancient records, such as the Mahabharata, he shows how a prehistoric
          nuclear war between the Atlanteans and the Aryans ultimately resulted
          in the sinking of Atlantis, and he uncovers the radioactive
          archaeological evidence left behind. Explaining how our ancient
          ancestors regretted their nuclear actions and destroyed or buried
          their advanced technology, entering into a self-imposed Stone Age, he
          shows how our civilization is headed down the same path and that only
          through “green” choices can we avoid the same fate as Atlantis.

          “This is a long-overdue book by an authority on the Carlo Crespi
          collection and what it means to our understanding of the first
          travelers to the Americas, <i>long</i> before Columbus. Not only is
          the case made for Atlantis in the Amazon, but Wingate also shows how
          this collection sounds a clear warning that humanity’s destructive
          ways are drawing us ever nearer to the same annihilation that wiped
          out this once thriving and advanced culture. Sadly, Wingate makes the
          case for the high probability that we are to go the way of Atlantis by
          continuing to use nuclear energy.”
