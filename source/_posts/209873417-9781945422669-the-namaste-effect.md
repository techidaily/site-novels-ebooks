            Namaste, a word used in many cultures, expresses that when we come
            from a place of love and oneness, we connect with others, to become
            one. Our times are plagued with senseless violence, bullying,
            prejudices, and blatant hatred. Something has happened to the model
            of love that all wisdom traditions expound upon as the greatest
            virtue—the concept of treating everyone as we wish to be treated. In
            The Namaste Effect, we are guided to such connection by tapping into
            our higher consciousness through the subtle energy centers known as
            chakras, to spark the release of love from our hearts and send it to
            others. With that action, we affect each other and eventually the
            entire globe.

          <p>
            In The Namaste Effect, master teacher, storyteller and healer
            Nischala Joy Devi shows the way to such connection by tapping into
            our higher consciousness through the subtle energy centers known as
            chakras, to spark the release of love from our hearts and send it to
            others. With that action, we affect each other and eventually the
            Namaste Effect enriches the entire globe. This book offers a way to
            live in this world by expressing love and compassion as our primary
            actions.

          <p>
            Told through a series of examples and heartwarming stories, Nischala
            Devi navigates through the seven chakras in her signature
            storytelling style that will appeal to her legions of avid fans as
            well as those new to her work. Many of these stories come from
            people who were tested beyond their limits and survived by reaching
            into the depth of their hearts to remember the spirit in everyone.
            They transformed profound wisdom by creating ways to resolve the
            traumas that life brings.

            “The Namaste Effect is brilliant. Nischala Joy Devi, a masterful
            guide and educator, comes from a deep place of love and oneness,
            inspiring us to do the same. The Namaste Effect illuminates each of
            the major chakras with a heartfelt and loving touch that rings with
            truth. She brings each chakra to life with soul, science,
            storytelling, and especially with love."&nbsp; —Julie Lusk, MEd,

            “The Namaste Effect is a heart-opening call to an inner awakening
            for a loving and compassionate life. Nischala Devi relates the
            subject of the chakras to an open spirituality which draws from
            religious and philosophical thoughts both from the East and the
            West. The examples from Nischala Devi's own life reveal her passion
            to heal the human heart with Love. May this book open many gates of

          on every page, with an engaging style that makes you feel you are in
          the arms of a loving mother reading you a story at bedtime. Yet hidden

          “This is an age when the words Namaste and Chakra are often bandied
          about with no idea what they really mean. In The Namaste Effect,
          Nischala Joy Devi takes us deep into the true heart of these spiritual
          treasures. With her own profound understanding, she opens doors and
          leads us into the real spiritual meaning, showing us how to use it to

          happiness. Through the vehicle of the 7 Mystical Chakras, this wise
