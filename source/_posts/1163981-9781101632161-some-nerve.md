          <b>“A compelling story of everyday courage” (Elizabeth Gilbert).</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Patty Chang Anker grew up eager to please and afraid to fail. But
          after thirty-nine years, she decided it was time to stop being a
          chicken. Motivated initially to become a better role model for her two
          kids, she vowed to master the fears that were choking the fun and
          spontaneity out of life. She learned to dive into a swimming pool,
          ride a bike, do a handstand, and surf. As she shared her experiences,
          she discovered that most people suffer from their own secret
          terrors—of flying, driving, heights, public speaking, and more. It
          became her mission to help others do what they thought they couldn’t
          and to experience the joy and aliveness that is the true reward of
          becoming brave.&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Inspired and inspiring, this book draws on Anker’s interviews with
          teachers, therapists, coaches, and clergy to convey both practical
          advice and profound wisdom. Through her own journey and the stories of
          others, she conveys with grace and infectious exhilaration the most
          vital lesson of all: Fear isn’t the end point to life, but the point
          of entry.
