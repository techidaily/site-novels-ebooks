          <b>"</b>This powerful healing work is something that’s missing in the
          world of mental and physical health today and is a light for others to
          find themselves and create new references and meaningful experiences
          that can be channeled to overcome any obstacle and succeed beyond
          their wildest dreams." — Anthony William, The Medical Medium, # 1
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author<br /><br />Manifestation
          requires staying in alignment with your best intentions and highest
          good; and many of the secrets to manifesting a beautiful life revolve
          around managing the defeating thoughts, feelings, and actions that
          throw you out of alignment.<br /><br />Noted manifestation expert
          Mandy Morris shares the eight powerful manifestation techniques she
          has developed based on divine guidance, scientific research, and a
          decade of work. They are fast, effective, and proven. These tools of
          the most highly effective manifesters include:<br />
          Infusing the manifestation process with self-love to help you work
          through your past, set positive intentions, and create a high
          vibration for manifestation goals to come trueDetangling dense energy
          (which impacts the neurological pathways) by understanding why what we
          want doesn’t show up, so we can set a clear path of creation (think of
          an unpaved road with potholes versus a smooth drive to your
          destination)Creating ways to energetically check in with
          yourselfManaging your psychological triggers with “pattern
          interrupts”Examining the rules you live by and being brave enough to
          rewrite them

          enlightened are ignored. This powerful healing work is something
          that’s missing in the world of mental and physical health today and is

          work is a unique bridge between modern psychology and spirituality

          other things, Mandy’s teachings give us a deep understanding for our
          less desired sides so we can be more loving towards ourselves and thus
          others. This understanding is, in my opinion, what mankind needs so
          desperately today to heal.” —&nbsp;<b>Dr. Afsoon Pouya</b>, coach and

          person’s life. In fact, I have personally experienced the
          life-changing results of her teachings. Above that, Mandy’s ability to
          improve lives comes from her profound love for all. A love that can
          transform each of us.” —&nbsp;<b>Michael Barnes, Ph.D.</b>,
          microbiologist, geneticist, and business coach<br /><br />“Mandy’s
          profound insights lay out the most important principles to mastering

          abundance, and put your spiritual understanding into practice.”

          management, abusive relationships, trauma, the science of manifesting,
          and the law of attraction.<br /><br />Mandy currently lives in
          Colorado with her husband, two sons, horses, dogs, and chickens near
