          <p>
            A life lived indoors is not a life lived. And yet many of us spend
            the majority of our days indoors, trapped in our own heads, addicted
            to our screens and online connections, and feeling more and more
            disconnected to our own bodies—and the planet—than ever before.
            Intuitively, we know that even a five-minute walk outdoors can calm
            us and awaken our senses, but we tell ourselves we don’t have time,
            or we can’t seem to make the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>The Earth Prescription</i>, holistic physician Laura Koniver,
            MD, offers the ideal antidote to the toxicity of a life isolated
            from nature—<i>grounding</i>, or directly touching the earth to heal
            your body and rejuvenate your sense of total well-being. Think about
            how good it feels to get outside and walk along the grass. This
            simple activity connects you to the earth, allowing you to reap its
            restorative powers—which include reducing depression, lowering blood
            pressure, curbing stress, and increasing happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this practical and uplifting guide, you’ll learn how to
            incorporate the practice of grounding anytime, anywhere, and find
            tips for including kids or your favorite pooch. Also included is an
            “earth journal” to log your experiences and positive results, as
            well as a troubleshooting guide to help ensure that you stay
            grounded in every season—despite the weather! This book will give
            you everything you need to enjoy the healing energy of nature—you
            simply have to get outside and get grounded.
