          <br />Jeff Tarrant was fascinated by the paranormal as a child but
          then his training as a neuropsychologist turned him into a hardcore
          skeptic. If something could not be reliably and consistently
          demonstrated in the laboratory, then it wasn’t real. These rigid ideas
          were gradually worn away as he repeatedly witnessed and experienced
          things that simply should not be possible—telekenesis, clairvoyance,
          telepathy, mediumship, energy healing, and more….This book follows his
          journey of studying, interviewing, and testing a wide variety of
          mediums, psychics, and healers as he tries to determine what is going
          on in their brains when they engage in these supernormal abilities.
          Readers will get to know these gifted people, exploring what makes
          them tick and discovering firsthand evidence that this stuff is
          real.<br />
          <br />
          If we can understand how the psychic mind works, might the rest of us
          be able to use this information to help develop our own abilities?
          <i>Becoming Psychic</i> uses knowledge uncovered through case studies,
          expert interviews, and research to offer a variety of practical
          insights to help readers develop their own psi abilities. Each chapter
          concludes with a “try it yourself” section, helping readers apply
          specific concepts and techniques into their own psychic development
          practice. In addition to uncovering the tips, skills, and tools
          identified in Tarrant's research, the book also explores how to use
          brain-hacking technology, such as neurofeedback, audio visual
          entrainment, and pulsed electromagnetic fields to “nudge” the brain
          toward heightened psychic abilities--as well as quieting internal
          chatter, supporting empathy, and enhancing creativity—all the mental
          skills necessary to move from balance and wellness to the
          extraordinary!<br />
          <br />
          <i>Becoming Psychic</i> fills an important gap in the psychic
          development literature. There are books that tell the stories of
          psychics and mediums. There are books that focus on the science and
          evidence for these practices, and there are books devoted to teaching
          you how to develop your own skills. This book contains all of the
          above and more!

          “Jeff Tarrant does a brilliant job at covering a wide range of psychic
          abilities and providing rigorous scientific data to support the
          phenomenon. The collected detail and results push the research of
          psychic phenomena to a whole new level of understanding. I highly
          recommend this book to anyone interested in the field of
          parapsychology,<br />
          psychic abilities, and the science of consciousness.”<br />
