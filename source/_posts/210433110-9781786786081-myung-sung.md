            >Introducing the Korean art of living meditation—with 8 simple keys
            for experiencing calm mindfulness in every moment of every day.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Most forms of meditation ask us to be still and quiet, to take time
          away from our busy lives and forget about our ever-growing to-do
          lists. Myung Sung, the peaceful art of Korean mindfulness, does the
          opposite. Myung Sung is active, and dynamic—a connectedness woven into
          our everyday experience through the practice of 8 simple steps.<br /><br />
          Through stories and wisdom passed down through generations and
          practical tools, Myung Sung will help you:<br /><br />
          • Find balance and happiness<br />
          •&nbsp;Calmly resolve conflict<br />
          •&nbsp;Walk through stress<br />
          •&nbsp;Accomplish your life goals<br /><br />
          Connect to your limitless reserves of natural energy and discover how
          your struggles—in work, marriage, parenting, friendships, health,
          money—become less difficult. By practicing the 8 keys of Myung Sung,
          you can transform the way you live your life and uncover a greater
          sense of balance between mind, body and spirit.

            anyone can learn to practice in their life as it is, without taking
            much time away from their work and family. Filled with deep wisdom,
            practical advice, and touching stories from her own family lineage,
            the wisdom traditions of Korea are not as of yet so well known in
            this country; this book may be about to change that."</i

            >"Dr. Jenelle Kim is a wealth of knowledge sharing the wisdom of 3
            major pillars: Medicine,&nbsp;Movement, and Meditation. When she
            discusses her studies as a Doctor of Eastern Medicine, she has such
            a healthy perspective of how modern medicine combined with herbal
            medicine is a great myriad for each individual. Modern medicine has
            given us a jumpstart, and it's incredible when mixed into a healthy
            lifestyle that involves movement, herbal remedies and of course
            meditation. The beautiful combination of herbal (Eastern medicine)
            combined with the knowledge of Western medicine is really what makes
            Dr. Jenelle Kim a true unicorn in the beauty and wellness space.
            Considering both is key when it comes to overall wellbeing and
            health, especially when it's communicated in such an educational and
            informational&nbsp;way.</i
