          <b>•</b> &nbsp;brew a cup of tea for divination purposes<br />&nbsp;
          <b>•</b> &nbsp;interpret more than 200 time-tested symbols that are
          most likely to show up, such as hearts and anchors, and what their

          up<br /><br />You already possess the tools, and with Sandra and
          Leanne's guidance, the true journey of self-discovery can begin. You
          don't have to be a witch to find your inner magic.

          "An approachable, savvy guide....&nbsp;Wright&nbsp;and Marrama’s
          enchanting handbook is a&nbsp;great starting point for those
          interested&nbsp;in tea-leaf reading."—<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b
          ><br /><br />"Brimming with easily digested instructions and
          exercises, steeped in little known historical facts, and sweetened
          with personal anecdotes and recipes,&nbsp;<i
            >Reading the Leaves&nbsp;</i
          >is definitely my cup of tea—and I have no doubt that it will be
          yours, too!"—<b>Dorothy Morrison</b>, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Everyday Magic, The Craft,&nbsp;</i
          >and&nbsp;<i>Utterly Wicked</i> <i><br /></i><br />"If you want to
          learn how to read tea leaves, this is absolutely the book for you.
          Sandra and Leanne are the perfect guides to this ancient and timeless
          practice that will activate your intuition and enrich your life.
          Follow their wise and whimsical advice and you'll be reading tea
          leaves like a pro in no time!"—<b>Tess Whitehurst</b>, author
          of&nbsp;<i>You Are Magical</i> <br /><br />“Tea leaf divination isn’t
          just for witches: it is a natural practice that can be enjoyed by all
          tea drinkers. This book transported me back to my time in England,
          sitting in an English cottage, with a tea cup and a silver spoon.
          <i>Reading the Leaves</i> is well researched; however, what makes its
          worth and power is experience. Both Leanne and Sandra have a heritage
          of knowledge that has been carried in families through the
          generations. Their ancestors have brought forward the method you will
          learn in this fun and informative read. In particular, I was impressed
          by their chapter on timing, which is always a challenge, even for
          authorities in occult divination. Their method by which timelines are
          captured brings accuracy to readings regarding past, present, and
          future. I am excited to try the recipes they have included, which are
          a delicious way to support divination, and add to the magic.”—<b

          >, author of&nbsp;<i>The Power of the Witch</i>, <i>Love Magic</i>,
          and&nbsp;<i>The Witch in Every Woman<br /></i><br />"This book is
          incredible. The combination of rituals and customs of a bygone era,
          storytelling, and straightforward practical instructions makes this
          book the quintessential practical handbook for anyone wanting to tap
          into this ancient form of divination. The authors have successfully
          applied their skill and years of experience to create a brilliant and
          accessible handbook for everyone, regardless of experience. As I read,
          I envisioned how easy it will be for me to share this book with
          friends and co-workers who may or may not be witches. It’s that
          universal. Although a practitioner of cartomancy for the most part of
          four decades, I have never been drawn to the practice of
          tasseomancy—until now. Sandra and Leanne instantly drew me in and made
          me want to put the kettle on to brew some tea and get down to the
          business of&nbsp;<i>Reading the Leaves</i>."—<b>Mary-Grace Fahrun</b>,
          author of&nbsp;<i>Italian Folk Magic: Rue’s Kitchen Witchery</i>
          <br />
          <i><br /></i>"I was not a tea-leaf- or coffee-grounds-reader before. I
          am now. That’s the highest praise I can give to a book that sets out
          to teach a technique. It hooked me with the presentation. It drew me
          in with clear explanation of history, theory, and method. It delivered
          in terms of enabling me to do the thing it describes. I am a better
          Sorcerer for having read <i>Reading the Leaves</i>."—<b

          >A&nbsp;smart, fun dive into a path of intuitive discovery. As I read,
          I felt like I was a having a conversation, over tea, with two
          powerhouse psychics who prove reliable and fresh, and care deeply
          about my experience. Packed with useful information as well as
          grounded reassurance,&nbsp;<i>Reading the Leaves</i>&nbsp;is a solid

          modern, practical and witty! Thorough and thoroughly inspired with
          rituals, recipes, symbolism, and timelines for manifestation,
          <i>Reading the Leaves</i> is the definitive accessible guide to
          tasseomancy for our time.&nbsp;Wright and Marrama&nbsp;have
          accomplished something truly magickal. Like a whisper from behind the
          veil, they have channeled the essence of a largely Victorian occult
          practice and catapulted into the mainstream magickal practice of today
          with grace, beauty, practicality, intelligence, and wit.
          <i>Reading the Leaves</i> is an impressive addition to the modern
          magical bookshelf, honing in on the ethics of prognostication, paying
          homage to the past, while being completely relevant to both secular
          magic practitioners as well as cunning folk. Let them lead you on a
          thrilling dive into the psychic depths of the teacup. From
          establishing the conducive atmosphere for divination, to choosing the
          perfect cup, as well as hundreds of symbols, Wright and Marrama serve
          the tea and keep it hot. With illustrations and explanations,
          <i>Reading the Leaves </i>is a must read for advanced practitioners
          and newcomers to tasseomancy alike."—<b>Judy Ann Nock</b>, author

          >"It is clear when first peering into <i>Reading the Leaves</i> that
          it is a labor of love. Its style invokes a Victorian elegance infused
          with a grandmother’s wisdom. You can&nbsp;almost smell the tea brewing
          from the kettle as you sit in a parlor lit by dim candlelight. Leanne
          Marrama and Sandra Mariah Wright weave a spell throughout&nbsp;the
          pages of this book, taking the reader on a journey from ancient China
          into your very own kitchen.<i> Reading the Leaves</i> is more than
          just another guide to&nbsp;divination. It is a window into the magic
          found within the lives of these two women and the people that they
          have touched with their magical gifts. This will be
          a&nbsp;foundational work on the subject of tea leaf reading that will
          be a much-cherished addition to anyone’s book collection. Upon reading
          this book, you will never have an empty&nbsp;tea cup—only a doorway to
          destiny!"—<b>Brian Cain</b>, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Initiation into Witchcraft</i
          >&nbsp; <br /><br />"<i>Reading the Leaves&nbsp;</i>is an empowering
          work of divination that reveals the hidden wisdom sprinkled across
          the&nbsp;bottom of an ordinary teacup. Salem&nbsp;witches Sandra
          Mariah Wright and Leanne Marrama offer an hospitable welcome into the
          charming but oft-mysterious world of&nbsp;tea leaf reading that makes
          it accessible to everyday people trying to make sense of their lives
          and provides tools of&nbsp;understanding using this time-honored
          method of foreseeing the past, present, and future. From the history
          of tea-leaf reading, to the symbols one might find in the cup, to
          recipes, rituals, and even communication with departed loved
          ones,&nbsp;<i>Reading the Leaves&nbsp;</i>bridges old-world wisdom
          with modern insight in what is sure to be a classic of the genre!"—<b
