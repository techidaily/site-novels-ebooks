          <b>More than 100,000 copies sold!</b><br /><br />Millions of Americans
          know yoga as a superb form of exercise and as a potent source of calm
          in the midst of our stress-filled lives. Far fewer are aware of the
          full promise of yoga as "the way of the fully alive human being"--a
          4,000-year-old practical path of liberation that fits the needs of
          modern Western seekers with startling precision.<br /><br />Now one of
          America's leading scholars of yoga psychology--who is also a
          Western-trained psychotherapist--offers this marvelously lively and
          personal account of an ancient tradition that promises "the soul awake
          in this lifetime."&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing on the vivid stories of
          practitioners at the largest yoga center in America, where he has
          lived and taught for more than ten years, Stephen Cope describes the
          philosophy, psychology, and practice of yoga--a practical science of
          development that urges us not to transcend or dissolve the self, but
          rather to encounter it more deeply.<br /><br />In this irreverent
          modern-day <b>Pilgrim's Progress</b>, Cope introduces us to an
          unforgettable cast of contemporary seekers--on the road to
          enlightenment carrying all the baggage of the human condition:
          confusion, loss, disappointment, addiction, and the eternal conflicts
          around sex and relationship. As he describes the subtle shifts of
          energy and consciousness that happen at each stage of the path, we
          discover that in yoga, "liberation" does not require us to leave life
          in the world for some transcendent spiritual plane. Life itself is the
          path.<br /><br />Above all, Cope shows how yoga can heal the suffering
          of self-estrangement that pervades our society, leading us to a new
          sense of purpose and to a deeper, more satisfying life in the world.

          "A down-to-earth, wise, spiritually mature and compassionate teaching
          that integrates the best of yoga and our own Western humanity.
          Destined to be a classic." —Jack Kornfield, author of
          <i>A Path with Heart</i><br /><br />
          "What a delight to find a book on spiritual practice that's as
          compelling to read as a good novel. This honest, intelligent, and
          beautifully written book is required reading for anyone interested in
          spiritual practice today."—Lilias Folan, host of the PBS series
          <i>Lilias!</i><br /><br />"A tour de force...a book grounded in yoga
          psychology that will be meaningful and useful to spiritual
          practitioners in many traditions."—Sylvia Boorstein, author of
          <i>It's Easier Than You Think</i> and
          <i>That's Funny, You Don't Look Buddhist</i
          ><br /><br />"Intellectually precise, profoundly moving, and
          gratifyingly accessible...Stephen Cope has written a book that offers
          hope that the fruits of spiritual practice and the attainment of
          wisdom are not for some more enlightened person, but for you and for
          me."—Donna Farhi, international yoga teacher and author of
          <i>The Breathing Book</i><br /><br />"With rare clarity and wit,
          Stephen Cope shows us how yoga can guide us through the maze of our
          psyche--and home to our own soul."—Anne Cushman, former editor in
          chief, <i>Yoga Journal,</i> and co-author of<i>
            From Here to Nirvana</i
          ><br /><br />"<b>Yoga and the Quest for the True Self</b> is a
          splendid bridge between traditional yoga and the concerns and needs of
          contemporary Western seekers. Stephen Cope takes you straight to the
          heart of yoga."—Georg Feuerstein, Ph.D., founder-president of the Yoga
          Research and Education Center; author of <i>The Yoga Tradition </i>and
          <i>The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga</i>
