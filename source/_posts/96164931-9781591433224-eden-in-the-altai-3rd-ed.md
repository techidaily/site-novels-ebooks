          Reveals how humanity’s first advanced culture originated in the
          Altai-Baikal region of southern Siberia <br /><br />• Explores how
          this prehistoric culture is the source of the pervasive mythic
          symbolism of the number 7, found in ancient cosmologies and myths
          around the world <br /><br />• Traces the Altaic influence on the
          Rishis of India, the creation of the Vedas, and the origin of the
          sacred legend of Mount Meru <br /><br />• Explains how the Hellenic
          cults of both Apollo and Artemis originated in southern Siberia as
          well as the pervasive bear symbolism found throughout the ancient
          world <br /><br />Myths of a Golden Age, a paradise at the beginning
          of human existence, are nearly universal in all cultures. But where
          was this “Eden” located? Refuting the traditional assumption that the
          cultures of the Middle East and Mycenae filtered northward into Europe
          and North Asia, noted historian Geoffrey Ashe instead identifies the
          northern Altai mountain range and Lake Baikal region of southern
          Siberia as the true cultural home of humanity and the source of the
          widespread myths of a prehistoric Golden Age. <br /><br />With
          evidence dating back as far as 24,000 BC, Ashe shows how the culture
          of prehistoric southern Siberia was matrifocal, Goddess-worshiping,
          and heavily shamanic and served as the progenitor of advanced ancient
          culture in the Western world, the missing link that later influenced
          Indian, Middle Eastern, Native American, and European society,
          culture, and religion. He reveals how ancient Altaic culture was the
          source of the pervasive mythic symbolism of the number 7, found in
          cosmologies and mythological traditions around the world, as well as
          reverence for the seven stars of Ursa Major, the Big Dipper, and the
          idea of a “sacred mountain to the North.” He traces the transmission
          of these cosmological beliefs into Babylon and ancient Greece by
          migrating tribes, including those that crossed the now-vanished land
          bridge to the New World. <br /><br />Ashe reveals how this
          transmission of beliefs had a profound influence on the seven-note
          musical scale, the seven astrological planets, and the seven vowels of
          the Greek alphabet, as well as the development of seven as a sacred
          number in Judaism. He shows how the ancient Altai-Baikal culture
          influenced the Rishis of India, the creation of the Vedas, and the
          sacred legend of Mount Meru. He also reveals how the Hellenic cults of
          both Apollo and Artemis originated in southern Siberia as well as the
          sacred bear symbolism found throughout the ancient world.
          <br /><br />Offering proof that advanced cultures existed in Europe
          before the immigration of Eastern peoples, Ashe shows that early
          societies did not look into the future for perfection but to the past,
          to the Golden Age of peace in the sacred northern mountains.

          “Recent archaeological discoveries in the Altai Mountains of Siberia
          have revealed the existence of a unique human population known today
          as the Denisovans. They reached their height around 60,000-70,000
          years ago and possessed advanced technologies that may well have
          contributed to the rise of civilization. Geoffrey Ashe, in his own
          fascinating quest of discovery, provides compelling evidence that the
          Altai Mountains are indeed the cradle of human civilization as well as
          the true Eden of the East.”
