            >Level up your stargazing skills and learn to interpret your own
            astrological birth chart with this fun, accessible guide to the
            twelve houses of the zodiac, perfect for armchair astrologers
            everywhere!</b
          ><br /><br />So you know your sun sign, rising sign, and moon sign…but
          what about the rest of your birth chart? It’s no longer enough to just
          to know you’re a Scorpio or read your horoscope. After all, delving
          deeper into our natal charts and the nuances of the astrological world
          can offer us a rich, exciting tapestry of our innate preferences,
          relationships, choices, and destiny<br />
          <br />For those in the know, the zodiac calendar is divided into
          twelve houses, each ruled by a different sign (Aquarius, Scorpio,
          Gemini, etc.) and said to govern a particular set of traits. When
          we’re born, where the planets were stationed relative to those houses
          inform our natural tendencies. Understanding each house can bring
          detailed insights about every aspect of your life: peoples’ first
          impression of you, to your values, communication, pleasure, home and
          family, partnership, and beyond.<br />
          <br />In order to fully understand our place in the universe we need
          to understand the meaning of each planet, the house it’s stationed in,
          and what that interaction means. Going house by house, practicing
          astrologer and artist Rachel Stuart-Haas teaches you how to create and
          interpret your unique birth chart, making this often dense and
          complicated layer of astrology accessible for newcomers and astrology
          enthusiasts alike.<br />
          <br />
          With her expert guidance, you will gain insight into questions
          like:<br />
          -Where will I feel at home?<br />
          -What career paths fulfill me?<br />
          -What do I need in a partner?<br />
          -What makes me feel abundant?<br />
          <br />Perfect for anyone who has ever been curious about their place
          in the world, <i>The House Your Stars Built</i> is a must-have and
          beautiful resource for astrology lovers.
