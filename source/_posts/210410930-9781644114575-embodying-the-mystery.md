          • Follows the author’s apprenticeships with masterful teachers,
          out-of-body experiences, meditation retreats in Asia, martial arts in
          Japan, facing his trauma at the hands of his father, and his struggles
          to become emotionally literate <br /><br />• Offers interpretations of
          his experiences poised as questions, reflections, and inquiries,
          inviting the reader to participate in what opened for the author on
          his quest for self-realization, including successes, failures,
          struggles, and enigmas <br /><br />Sharing profound stories,
          transformative incidents, and provocative situations from across his
          more than 7 decades of life, founding elder of the Somatics movement
          Richard Strozzi-Heckler explores the moments of insight and awakening
          that have been pivotal in forming his unique perspectives within the
          fields of embodiment, meditation, aikido, and leadership.
          <br /><br />Beginning with an early experience with death that
          revealed the universal principle of impermanence, the author takes us
          on a rich, textured journey into the inquiry of what it means to
          embody the mystery of Spirit. As we follow him through apprenticeships
          with masterful teachers, out-of-body experiences, meditation retreats
          in Asia, martial arts in Japan, facing his trauma at the hands of his
          father, and his struggles to become emotionally literate, we’re also
          taken on a path of learning, healing, and transformation.
          <br /><br />For each story, the author offers interpretations of his
          experiences poised as questions, reflections, and inquiries. In this
          way we are invited to participate on his quest for self-realization,
          including successes, failures, struggles, and enigmas. A deeply
          personal and intimate portrayal of a life’s journey through a somatic
          wisdom, this insightful memoir depicts the immeasurable wealth that
          teachers, practices, vulnerability, and community can offer the
          sincere seeker on an embodied spiritual path.
