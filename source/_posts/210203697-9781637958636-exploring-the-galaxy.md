            <strong>The universe is a vast and largely unknown entity.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            But from what we do know of space, it's safe to say that there are
            some very bizarre things out there!
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you interested in learning more about the wider galaxy,
            including some of the strange discoveries that have been made?
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps you have a desire to learn more about space, but sometimes
            the terminology used or theories discussed can seem quite complex
            and not very inclusive.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Well that is not the case anymore! I have created this book to
              break down some of the more difficult and intricate subjects
              surrounding space into simple and easy-to-read chapters.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Like you, I have always been fascinated by the concept of space and
            our wider galaxy. The thought that there might be life on other
            planets, other solar systems, or even other suitable planets for
            humans to live on has always intrigued me.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when I went to research these subjects in more detail
            online, I was often left more confused about the topic than when I
            first started!
          </p>
          <p>
            That is because scientists and academics often tend to discuss the
            subject of space in complicated and involved detail. This is all
            well and good if you are an astrophysicist, but what about the rest
            of us?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where my book comes into play. I break down years of
            research in these complex subjects into simple-to-understand,
            easy-to-read chapters, making the concept of space accessible to
            anyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't need a degree to be able to take away loads of knowledge
            from this book!
          </p>

              >Some of the most famous and bizarre objects in space</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A newfound interest and desire to
            learn more about space
          </p>
          <p>
            ●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very large and complex subjects,
            covered in a new and accessible way
          </p>
          <p>
            That is just an inkling of the many different topics that are
            covered!
          </p>
          <p>
            It has never been easier to learn about space than with this book.
            Gone are the hours of trying to decipher needlessly technical
            jargon. Instead, you will easily grasp subjects and concepts
            quickly.
