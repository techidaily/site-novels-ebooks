            People disappear without a trace. Captain Briggs, his crew, and his
            family vanished from the Canadian built Mary Celeste. Ben Bathurst
            walked around the horses harnessed to his coach - and was never seen
            again. People appear without explanation Kaspar Hauser arrived in
            Nuremberg as inexplicably as if he'd materialised from some unknown
            dimension. Researchers of the paranormal have investigated cases
            where thought-forms seem to have acquired quasi-physical properties.
            Madame Blavatsky claimed to have done it. There were times when
            Nikola Tesla, the brilliant electrical experimenter, seems to have
            lived in an alternative reality where mental images of his machines
            became solid to him. Tesla expert, Oliver Nichelson, put forward a
            theory connecting Tesla's awesomely strange apparatus at
            Wardenclyffe, Long Island, with the Tunguska explosion of 1908. Were
            similar strange forces responsible for moving the Barbados coffins
            around in their sealed vault?
          </p>
          <p>
            Where do poltergeists, like the one that haunted Esther Cox in
            Amherst, Nova Scotia, get their inexplicable energy? When scores of
            reliable witnesses continue to report their sightings of UFOs,
            ghosts, crop circles, lake monsters, enormous cat-like beasts, Yeti,
            and Sasquatch, how can their observations be explained?
          </p>
          <p>
            We live in an immeasurably strange universe, miraculously suspended
            in space and time: a universe that has room for the mysteries of the
            ancient British King Arthur, Merlin, and the Holy Grail; the Oak
            Island Money Pit in Canada; the undeciphered Glozel Alphabet, and
            the Priest's Treasure at Rennes-le-Chateau in France; Mermaids and
            Sea Monsters; the Kingdom of Prester John; the Riddle of the Pictish
            Stones at Meigle in Scotland; the Vampire of Croglin Grange; Zombies
            and Wer-beasts; the Devil's Footprints in Devonshire; the Green
            Children of Woolpit; Lost Cities and Sunken Islands; Pyramids and
            Stone Circles; Telepathy, Telekinesis, Teleportation, and Prophecy.
            The list is endless. The investigations fascinating.

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Lionel Fanthorpe is a world authority on unexplained phenomena and the
          paranormal. In the 1970s he lectured on it for Cambridge University's
          Board of Extra-Mural Studies, and is a prolific writer and radio and
          television broadcaster on unsolved mysteries. His other interests
          include martial arts and weight training. A recent article by Mike
          Buckingham in the Argus describes him as a combination of Stallone's
          toughness and Mrs. Thatcher's decisiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Patricia Fanthorpe contributes the accurate and efficient research
          capabilities which their kind of work demands. She's also Lionel's
          sole agent and PR executive, and enjoys folk dancing when their
          schedule allows! Married since 1957, they have two daughters and live
          in Cardiff, Wales, UK.
