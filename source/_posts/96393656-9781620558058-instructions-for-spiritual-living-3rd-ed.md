          Answers to the questions that arise on the spiritual path
          <br /><br />• Includes specially selected writings from the huge
          literary archive of Paul Brunton <br /><br />• Explains the different
          stages of meditation and the obstacles likely to arise for each,
          offering guidance for achieving advanced states of meditation to
          deepen one’s inner life <br /><br />• Challenges the need for
          spiritual dependency on any particular guru, teaching, or practice,
          showing that following your intuition can bring the best spiritual
          success <br /><br />• Explores the process of self-examination and
          emotional purification, revealing how to break free from the ego and
          tap into the inspiration flowing from within <br /><br />No matter
          where we are in our spiritual development, we all have questions about
          our practice and what we are experiencing--both the challenges and
          opportunities. How can I overcome my struggles to meditate more
          deeply? Is there a need for a guru or can I rely on myself? Can I
          trust my intuition? Is it possible to hear the “Inner Word,” the voice
          of the soul, and how can I be sure that’s what I’m hearing? Is the
          Higher Self in the heart? <br /><br />Offering trustworthy answers to
          these and many more questions, renowned spiritual teacher Paul Brunton
          provides instructions to guide one’s development in three fundamental
          areas of the spiritual path: meditation, self-examination, and the
          unfolding of awakening. Guiding you with insight and care through each
          stage of meditation, including advanced states that deepen one’s inner
          life, he explains how meditation is the art and practice of
          introverting attention, of freeing oneself for a period of time from
          thoughts, sensations, and feelings and allowing the soul to reveal
          itself out of the quiet that one has created. He explains the goal of
          each meditative stage and the obstacles you are likely to face and
          examines the need for spiritual dependency on any particular guru,
          teaching, or practice, showing that following your intuition can bring
          spiritual success. <br /><br />Exploring the process of
          self-examination and emotional purification, Brunton shows how life’s
          challenges are moments by which we can make real progress in our
          surrender to a higher life. He reveals how to break free from the ego,
          follow your intuition to align with your ideals, and tap into the
          inspiration flowing from within. He also examines the development of
          transcendental insight, the cornerstone of compassionate wisdom in
          action, which allows us to become a source of inspiration to all we
          encounter. <br /><br />Including writings received by the Paul Brunton
          Philosophic Foundation after his death, this guide offers
          transformative wisdom to aid our understanding of what the spiritual
          journey entails, help point the way when the way is uncertain, and
          learn and grow from the challenges that arise as you develop
          spiritually.
