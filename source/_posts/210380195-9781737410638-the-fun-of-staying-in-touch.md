            Those who have died usually give us touching and sometimes amazing
            signs of their survival, very much as if they were sending postcards
            from the beautiful realities where they now reside. Unfortunately,
            few of those who are grieving are aware of the kinds of things that
            the newly dead most often do to prove to us that they have survived,
            so many of these post-death signs are missed. And if we don't
            acknowledge what our dead loved ones are doing for us, soon they
            will shrug and give it up. In The Fun of Staying in Touch, Roberta
            Grimes lays out in simple terms how these signs from the dead are
            delivered, how to spot and acknowledge them, and how to encourage
            ongoing relationships with people we used to think were dead. Our
            loved ones are always available to communicate; they are only a
            thought away. They receive our requests to speak with them and come
            from wherever they are, without question. Roberta's book also
            examines the many ways in which we ourselves can initiate contact
            with those who have died, some ancient and some on the cutting edge.
            From scrying and pendulums through self-induced communications and
            the soul phone, this whole area of exploring ways to stay in touch
            with those we love holds exciting possibilities that are going to
            bear fruit later in this century. It is looking ever more likely now
            that before long those that we used to think were lost will be only
            a loving phone call away.
