        <p><strong>Praise for Simply Put</strong></p>
        <p>
          "One of Danit's many talents is incredible physical adjustments. She
          can spot your physical pain from across a room and shift your posture
          in just the right way to create space throughout the body. Simply Put
          is like these physical adjustments in book form: a clear, thoughtful
          collection of small lessons and observations, written to be accessible
          and relevant to all readers, and sure to make big shifts when applied
          over time. Simply Put brims with heart, honesty, compassion, and
          wisdom."

          "For the first time in my life, I laid my eyes on a book that felt
          like a friend. In a single statement, Simply Put is the most
          penetrating rendition of "Life for Dummies." Every single reminder,
          sentence, and overview provides tangible mechanisms for life's endless
          pickles in a way that allows you to feel human during the process. A
          truly life-changing read."

          "Simply Put is an invitation to consider our daily experiences
          differently, take a bird's eye view, remain true to ourselves, and
          accept the impermanent nature of life. Danit provides the opportunity
          and permission for us to truly observe our discomfort and
          vulnerability while making them the stepping stones of learning and
          strength on our individual paths. Danit's sincere and compassionate
          writing is as approachable as she is, and Simply Put is a gift to all
          readers."

          "Simply Put tops my short stack of essential reads for personal growth
          and deflecting stress. With concise, insightful acuity, Danit treats
          us to a wellspring of practical, applicable wisdom. Her precise and
          intuitive instructional narrative mirrors her gifted teaching
          methodology. The tenets of her core beliefs, principles, and sequences
          cultivate a practice of intention, choice, and awareness. Danit's
          authentic voice resonates with relevancy, inspiring us to explore our
          authenticity."

        <p>
          "Simply Put beautifully bridges the timeless teachings of yoga with a
          contemporary and pragmatic perspective on life. Rich family
          narratives, rooted in a tradition of strong and compassionate women,
          offer fresh insights into daily challenges. Simply Put inspires a
          newfound appreciation for everyday moments and encourages approaching
          life with curiosity. After reading, I'll never leave a pickle jar
          half-open and am committed to embracing chores with an open mind."

          Danit's wisdom and skill deftly demonstrate how to apply yoga and
          meditation to approach the world in a therapeutic and meaningful way.
          It's a primer for life wrapped in a blanket, with a cup of tea,

          advice. Readers will benefit from Danit's approach to life's ups and
