            Two people go to see a doctor. They both have the same illness. He
            gives the same treatment to both people. One person heals yet the
            other does not-why? Is it the doctor? The doctors gave the exact
            same treatment to both people! This is where it now falls on you the
            individual. One person took responsibility for their healing and
            they healed. The other did not and they didn’t heal. Life can and
            does teach us through sickness. Once you learn the lesson that the
            sickness is trying to teach you; the sickness goes away! I repeat
            once you learn the lesson that the sickness is trying to teach you;
            the sickness goes away!
          </p>

            A person can catch a cold or the flu during the winter months. But a
            person does not catch Cancer or Hepatitis or Lupus. These diseases
            and most major diseases manifest over various periods of time - not
            over night! If you are suffering from a major disease, your body has
            been crying out to you but you didn’t understand what it needed from
            you to be healthy. You do not yet understand the language in which
            your body was speaking to you. Now, you are about to embark on your
            inner journey of self-healing. You will discover how to become your
            body’s best friend and it will reward you with good health. As you
            begin to understand what your physical hygiene is, you will grow to
            understand your Mental and Emotional Hygiene and how important they
            are to maintain good health as well. All human beings have the power
            to heal themselves! If a child falls and hurts his/her knee they
            will immediately put their hand on the knee. If the child has a
            stomachache they will put their hand on the stomach. Instinctively,
            the child is placing his or her hand over the area where there is
            pain. By doing this the child is sending healing energy into their
            body albeit unconsciously. No one has to teach them to this,
            children do it naturally!
          </p>

            James was stricken with the virus of Hepatitis, first the A virus
            and then the B virus. James was then afflicted with the Hepatitis C
            virus which is a deadly killer! The doctors placed him on
            “Interferon” but all treatments failed. At that point, the doctors
            said he couldn’t be cured thus he needed to prepare his will and put
            his house in order. In other words, the doctors told him he was
            going to die. Yet today James is “Hepatitis Free”. The virus is not
            dormant. It is not in remission-it is gone! Today James has
            completely overcome the virus and is Hepatitis Free. Common Sense
            Healing is the methodology that gives the “Healing Mindset” that he
            discovered and is critical for the success of those people that
            doctor say have no hope.

            James received a medical discharge from the core of U.S. Army
            doctors at Walson Army Hospital. He became interested in alternative
            healing methods because he had no other hope. James became a healer
            by practicing on himself out of necessity. He is a 5th degree
            Buddhist Healing Master and he has studied “7 Rays”, “Crystal
            Therapy” and “Sound Therapy”, “Laying on The Hands Light Technique”
            and has been deeply involved in Meditation over 38 years.
