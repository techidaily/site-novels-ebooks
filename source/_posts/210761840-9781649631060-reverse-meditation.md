              >Disruptive practices to revolutionize your relationship with
              meditation and fully engage with the full breadth of your
              experience.</b
            ><br /><br />Why do we meditate? The main reason most modern people
            start meditating is because it helps us feel better—reducing
            anxiety, improving sleep, decluttering the mind, and so forth. “But
            where does your meditation go when things go bad?” asks Andrew
            Holecek. “Where is your spirituality when ‘rock meets bone,’ as they
            say in Tibet—when the crap hits the fan?”<br /><br /><i
              >Reverse Meditation </i
            >is for anyone who wants to bring the challenges of life onto the
            path of awakening. When things get hard, it’s time to turn your
            practice on its head—and throw out any assumption that meditation
            exists to insulate you from the confusion, difficulties, and
            uncertainty of life. “By putting your meditation into reverse,”
            Holecek teaches, “you’ll actually find yourself going forward. Step
            into your pain and you can step up your evolution.”<br /><br />With
            his signature blend of depth and accessibility, Holecek invites you
            to explore:<br /><br />• Three core forms of meditation—mindfulness,
            open awareness, and the boundary-smashing reverse meditations<br />•
            How to know when you’re ready to engage with reverse meditation<br />•
            On-the-spot practices for snapping into a meditative mindset in
            difficult situations<br />• Contraction and expansion—how to
            dismantle habits of avoidance to become more open, resilient, and
            fully alive<br />• How reverse meditation opens you to a direct
            experience of the fundamental perfection of reality—just as it is<br /><br />“These
            unique meditations are designed to reverse our relationship to
            unwanted experiences, which means going directly <i>into</i> them
            instead of avoiding them,” says Andrew Holecek. “It’s not an easy
            journey—yet this path leads to the discovery of unconditional
            happiness, basic goodness, and true freedom in the most turbulent
            situations.”

          “Andrew has done it again! First he nudged us toward lucidity in the
          sleep bardo with his awesome book <i>Dream Yoga</i>. Then toward more
          lucidity in the life bardo with the even more awesome
          <i>Dreams of Light</i>. Now he brilliantly demonstrates how there need
          be no gaps, even when we confront the untoward, when we are jarred out
          of positive awareness by adversity and pain and injury, and we turn it
          all into advantage in his latest great work, this wonderful
          <i>Reverse Meditation</i>. I cannot recommend it highly enough—a great
          read and immensely useful for thriving and evolving positively in this
          world of obstacles.” —<b>Robert Thurman</b>, professor emeritus,
          author of <i>Wisdom Is Bliss</i> and the Bantam Books translation of
          The Tibetan Book of the Dead<br /><br />“<i>Reverse Meditation</i> is
          a brilliant masterpiece that illustrates that Andrew Holecek’s
          extensive exploration of inner space has given him a unique
          perspective of outer space. Andrew understands that each and every one
          of us is in space at this very moment. Not only are we all traveling
          through the Universe on this spaceship that we call Earth, but we also
          generate the illusion of solid ground through our individual egos.
          Andrew clearly demonstrates that many of the problems we all face can
          be traced to our futile attempts to give our egos a place to stand.
          Through reverse meditation, we can mold ourselves into the softest,
          most open, yet strongest and most indestructible thing in the
          Universe—space itself. Nothing can hurt space! A must-read for anyone
          who wants to improve their life and expand their horizons.” —<b
            >Ron Garan</b
          >, former NASA astronaut, author of <i>Floating in Darkness</i>
          <br /><br />“Meditation sometimes becomes dualistic: we learn to let
          go of thoughts and feelings, to cultivate an empty mind. What do we
          lose when we split ourselves like that? What might we realize if,
          instead of contracting in the face of pain and other unwanted
          experience, we open up to them—realize our nonduality with them?
          <i>Reverse Meditation</i> shows us how to do that and how it can
          transform our lives.” —<b>David R. Loy</b>, author of
          <i>Money, Sex, War, Karma</i><br /><br />“Holecek encourages active
          attention and diligence toward disarming the harsh inner critic that
          can surface within; the practices and anecdotes presented in this book
          will provide readers with an opportunity for doing just that. His aim
          is to help release the tension that we can create through the fear of
          failure, and ease into an expansive space of open, loving awareness.”
          —<b>Sharon Salzberg</b>, author of <i>Lovingkindness</i> and
          <i>Real Life</i> <br /><br />“Cleaning the mirror of the heart, so
          that our True Face can be clearly reflected—free of all distortion
          that comes from, as Andrew Holecek writes, the ‘contraction’—is the
          fruit of all spiritual practice. In this wonderful, wise, and
          insightful book, we find a clear path… a deep intuitive explanation of
          where we are, where we are going, and how to get there.” —<b
            >Krishna Das</b
          >, Grammy®-nominated musician<br /><br />“One of the most important
          books on meditation to ever be written, <i>Reverse Meditation</i> is a
          must-read how-to manual for transforming our painful contractions into
          expansive freedom. Reversing our habitual tendency to
          <i>turn away</i> from our pain and discomfort, Andrew Holecek
          masterfully adapts ancient technologies of awakening into
          contemporary, accessible practices of transformation, skillfully
          showing us how to <i>turn toward</i> our suffering in order to
          experience the spacious freedom that abides at the heart of every
          moment.” —<b>Zvi Ish-Shalom, PhD</b>, professor of world wisdom at
          Naropa University and author of <i>The Kedumah Experience</i> and
          <i>The Path of Primordial Light</i>
