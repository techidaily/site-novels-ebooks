          better understanding of the human mind with all the trials and

          >, internationally renowned medium, spiritual teacher, and
          best-selling author<br /><br />"Amanda brings an incredible gift to
          the table that I have personally witnessed… helping you connect in
          with your most authentic self. Through psychology and her psychic
          abilities combined she offers something unique, powerful and deep.
          Amanda helped me through some of the most turbulent times of my life
          and was absolutely invaluable to my support system. I’m so excited for
          the world to read this book!"&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Mel Wells</b>, author
          of&nbsp;<i>The Goddess Revolution<br /></i><br />"The moment I met
          Amanda, it was clear that she had a message for us all. She's been
          gifted with insight both lived and learned which, through its sharing,
          will support humanity in making strides towards a deeper understanding
          of who we are and therefore our own power. Amanda triumphs
          with&nbsp;<i>The Psychic Psychologist</i>, a book that is graceful in
          its curiosity around scientific fact, and humble, despite compelling
          evidence of the current limitations around psychological and mental
          health care. This is a book with the potential to support the approach
          and treatment of mental health to expand exponentially. More than that
          though, when you immerse yourself in this book, it will blast open
          your perception of the possibilities for your life in a quite
          sensational way. Read it slowly and more than once. This is a truly
          wonderful and important book."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Jessica Huie MBE</b>,
          author of&nbsp;<i>Purpose</i><br /><br />"Are you feeling lost,
          disconnected, or yearning for positive change? Look no further.
          Renowned psychologist and intuitive guide Amanda Charles is here to
          lead you on a path to reconnecting with your authentic self and
