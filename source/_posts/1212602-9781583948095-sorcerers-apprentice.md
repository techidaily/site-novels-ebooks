          S<i>orcerer’s Apprentice </i>opens with Amy Wallace’s first meeting
          with Carlos Castaneda, the infamous anthropologist-turned-shaman,
          whose books described meetings with Yaqui Indian spiritual teacher don
          Juan. Castaneda’s rise was meteoric in the late 1960s as he wrote
          massive bestsellers, inspired many to experiment with psychedelics,
          and was dubbed “the Godfather of the New Age.” The possibility that
          Castaneda’s experiences may have been fabricated did little to
          compromise his legend.As the daughter of best-selling novelist Irving
          Wallace, Amy was rarely shy around famous people. When her father
          insisted she meet Castaneda, she at first demurred. Little did she
          know that a delightful first meeting would begin a 20-year friendship,
          followed by her descent into the dramatic and deeply troubled affair
          chronicled in this book. <i>Sorcerer’s Apprentice </i>unblinkingly
          reveals the inner workings of the “Cult of Carlos,” run by a
          charismatic authoritarian in his sixties who controlled his young
          female followers through emotional abuse, mind games, bizarre rituals,
          dubious teachings, and sexual excess. Wallace’s story is both specific
          and universal, a captivating cautionary tale about the dangers of
          giving up one’s power to a tyrant–and about surviving assaults on body
          and spirit.

          "Amy Wallace expertly maps the territory where mysticism merges into
          insanity, or perhaps the unmarked land between screwball comedy and
          terrifying tragedy. I can’t recall a stranger, sadder narrative than
          this."—Carolyn See, author of <i>Making a Literary Life</i>“Truth
          hurts … and so does <i>Sorcerer’s Apprentice. </i>Amy Wallace’s
          harrowing account of her years as Carlos Castaneda’s lover and
          disciple is a cautionary tale for our times, the story of a woman
          whose search for meaning took her to the brink, and damned near cost
          her everything. In this painfully honest memoir, she takes us deep
          inside the Castaneda cult and shows us the mind games, ego trips, and
          petty cruelties that wore the guise of wisdom. ‘Pay no attention to
          the man behind the curtain!’ the Wizard once tried to tell Dorothy.
          Amy Wallace has ripped the curtain down, and laid the wizard bare for
          all to see.”—George R.R. Martin, author of <i>A Game of Thrones</i>“<i
            >Sorcerer’s Apprentice</i
          >
          is a haunting and brutally honest memoir that reads like a tender love
          story and, at the same time, a taut psychological thriller. Amy
          Wallace writes with wisdom, grace, courage, and candor about one of
          the most charismatic figures of all our times, and she allows us to
          witness both the splendor and the danger of entrusting one’s fate to a
          powerful man or woman.”—Jonathan Kirsch, author of
          <i>The Harlot by the Side of the Road</i> and
          <i>The Woman Who Laughed at God</i>"I simply could not put this book
          down. Amy Wallace’s relationship with Carlos Castaneda was
          transformative, exciting, abusive, and painful. This is a cautionary
          tale, containing essential insights for all of us. Thank you, Amy, for
          having the courage to tell your story so that others may learn from
          it, and from the redemptive powers of your own healing."—Susan Piver,
          author of <i>The Hard Questions</i>
