          A guide to personal spiritual initiation through the transformation of
          habitual patterns, apathy, and resistance <br />
          <br />• Based on the Native American medicine wheel, the Vedic wheel,
          and the universal initiatory mandala <br />
          <br />• Enables readers from any tradition to initiate themselves
          through practices of thought transformation, narrative medicine,
          meditation exercises, rituals, and journaling <br />
          <br />• Facilitates breaking through personal and societal illusions
          that perpetuate resistance and apathy <br />
          <br />Intentions and spiritual principles, meditation and
          contemplation, ritual, and risk-taking are the conditions that
          comprise an initiated life. Regrettably, in modern society we do not
          have rites of initiation that break through the personal and societal
          illusions that instill and perpetuate negative habits that keep us in
          states of resistance. Lacking initiation practices, we often remain
          trapped in ways of being in the world that were formed by our past
          conditions and attachments. We tend to identify too strongly with the
          status quo, which must be challenged to prevent stagnation and to
          encourage happiness and authenticity. <br />
          <br />Julie Tallard Johnson shows how to become initiated into an
          authentic life through practices of thought transformation,
          cultivating attention, journaling, storytelling, and rituals found in
          the four directions of the universal mandala. She begins the Wheel of
          Initiation in the South, where initiates set their intentions; then
          moves into the West, where they free themselves from habitual patterns
          and core beliefs; then into the North, the direction of cultivating
          attention and unity; and finishes in the East, the direction of
          regeneration and initiation. Drawing upon the life experiences of
          those who have successfully navigated the wheel, Johnson demonstrates
          that once fears, assumptions, and ingrained beliefs are confronted and
          transformed, initiates emerge ready to reenter society with renewed
          energy and vision that will enrich their own lives and their
          communities.

          “For me, entering the Wheel with Julie and our circle was the
          beginning of an awareness and excavation of long held beliefs. It was
          like having the threads of an aware life weave our own meaningful
          tapestry.”
