              >As seen on <i>The Joe Rogan Experience!<br /></i><br />A
              revolution is underway. For the first time in human history, we
              are at the cusp of experiencing contact with nonhuman life-forms
              of all kinds due to technological innovations and research into
              the experiences of people at the forefront of this development.</b
            ><br /><br />In<i> Encounters</i>, author D.W. Pasulka takes readers
            to the forefront of this revolution, sharing the work of experts
            across a spectrum of fields who are working to connect humanity with
            unknown life-forms.<br /><br />Most of us have visions of nonhuman
            encounters that are shaped far more by Hollywood than they are
            informed by the current research. <i>Encounters </i>rewrites our
            visions of nonhuman species by featuring the work and stories of
            contemporary innovators who are rethinking our most basic
            assumptions about life and its manifestations beyond our
            experience.<br /><br />The author of <i>American Cosmic, </i>D.W.
            Pasulka is a professor of religion at UNC, Wilmington; her work as a
            scholar has given her the tools to systematically examine data that
            exceeds rational categories—exactly the skillset needed to parse the
            world of UFOs, angels, AI, dreams, and other dimensions, which exist
            at the edges of human understanding. <i>Encounters </i>is a riveting
            exploration of the leading science of nonhuman life and a bold
            glimpse of the future of humanity in a universe where we are far
            from alone.

          "<i>Encounters</i> is a ground-breaking, multi-layered look at aspects
          of the UFO phenomenon that are rarely explored with such clarity,
          sophistication and insight. While the study of UFO evidence has
          captivated the world for decades, <i>Encounters </i>ventures further,
          diving into the enigmatic realms of the mystery that lie at the heart
          of this phenomenon, and which have touched the lives of so many
          people. Through profiles of unusual, gifted individuals with much to
          teach us, we learn how scientists and technologists are motivated to
          explore profound questions about the nature of consciousness as a
          result of their own connections to non-human intelligence. I highly
          recommend this book."<br />—<b>Leslie Kean</b>, investigative reporter
          and author of
          <i
            >UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the
            Record</i
          ><br /><br />"Diana Pasulka takes us galaxies beyond her essential
          <i>American Cosmic</i>, with<i> Encounters</i>. Here she delves into
          the patterns of creation, visions of Saint Michael, the protector of
          children, to synchronicity and the wide variety of interactions humans
          have with nonhuman intelligences. This is a deeply moving meditation
          on consciousness and all that we do not know about the mystery we
          exist within. One of the great recent books on the subject, sure to
          fascinate those interested in both spiritual and alien encounters.
          Simply breathtaking in its scope and the depth of its feeling."
          <br />—<b>Josh Boone</b>, director of
          <i>The Fault in Our Stars </i>and
          <i>X-Men: The New Mutants, </i>creator of <i>The Stand<br /></i
          ><br />"Diana Pasulka has applied her prodigious academic skills to
          the generally dismissed subjects of UFOs and close encounters, and the
          result is astonishing and revelatory. The present will greet this book
          with wary surprise; the future will call it a masterwork."<br />—<b
            >Whitley Strieber</b
          >, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>Communion</i
          ><br /><br />"The next essential chapter in the UFO mystery. A
          compelling page-turner that confronts the elephant in the room on
          UFOs. That, on the evidence, the key to this intriguing mystery is
          least likely to be that these strange objects are just mere
          super-advanced craft from a technologically superior non-human
          intelligence. In <i>Encounters,</i> Pasulka coaxes her fascinating UFO
          experiencers to reveal a frequent preternatural high-strangeness
          associated with their sighting events; the woo behind these events is
          an uncomfortable feature not commonly emphasized, indeed often
          overlooked. Her thesis is that maybe the very thing being ignored is
          the key. Why, she asks, do so many great thinkers and creatives credit
          their ground-breaking ideas to dreams and downloads? Is the phenomenon
          an organic uber AI seeding human consciousness with transcending ideas
          and UFO ‘craft' just but one manifestation of a broader enigma?
          Underlying all indigenous knowledge systems is this idea of
          pan-psychism, a sentient environment. She questions if the notion of
          an organic internet explains the aboriginal dreamtime, even God. The
          most intriguing question she poses is whether humanity’s intimacy with
          technology is making us all blind to what we once were and are truly
          capable of being."<br />—<b>Ross Coulthart</b>, author of
          <i
            >In Plain Sight: An Investigation into UFOs and Impossible
            Science<br /></i
          ><br />"We are schooled by D.W. Pasulka in two seemingly contradictory
          truths: the UFO phenomenon is riven with disinformation and
          distortion, and the UFO phenomenon is real. Pasulka also explains why
          it is the experiencers of nonhuman or superhuman intelligence who
          count, and why the study of religion has the most to say about their
          altered states and cosmic realizations. <i>Encounters</i> is a model
          of where we should go from here—into a future beyond our present
          understandings of the natural and the supernatural, of religion and
          science. That is the past. This is the future."<br />—<b
            >Jeffrey J. Kripal</b

          <i
            >The Superhumanities: Historical Precedents, Moral Objections, New
            Realities</i
          ><br /><br />"In <i>Encounters</i>, Dr. D. W. Pasulka continues a
          deeply profound journey to unravel the UFO mystery and place an
          empathetic microscope on those who have experienced it. Invisible
          hands continue to weave an uncharted path for Pasulka as she navigates
          a maze of government involvement with the UFO topic and the narrative
          painted between the gaps of uncertainty, while also exploring a very
          human lens through the scientists, researchers, and experiencers who
          truly shape the UFO interpretation. While the goal may appear to be a
          crossing of these paths, Pasulka eloquently proves that sometimes the
          journey is far more important than the final destination."<br />
          —<b>Ryan Sprague, </b>author and podcaster,
          <i>Somewhere in the Skies</i> <br /><br />"Diana Pasulka brings to the
          incomplete study of unidentified phenomena the missing parts that make
          it tick: a subtle, caring way to transcend the rough political and
          military turmoil that has long disfigured the research; and a formal
          framework for the spiritual reinterpretation of what the witnesses
          say. Her book is a staircase to the top level."<br />—<b
            >Jacques Vallee</b
          >, author, scientist, and venture capitalist <br /><br />“In
          <i>Encounters</i>, Dr. Pasulka offers us a mind-expanding view of what
          'contact' means. She explores the role of the paranormal, the
          invisible and the spiritual as integral parts of the UFO contact
          experience. She also explores the role of technology and AI as a new
          form of contact through her fascinating profiles of scientists and
          innovators. After reading this deeply insightful book, if you aren’t
          surprised by what she reveals, you haven’t been paying attention.“<br />
          —<b>Rizwan Virk</b>, founder of Play Labs @ MIT and author of
          <i>The Simulation Hypothesis</i> and <i>Wisdom of a Yogi<br /></i
          ><br />"If <i>American Cosmic</i> took readers to super-secret crash
          sites in the desert and off-limits vaults of the Vatican, D. W.
          Pasulka’s new book <i>Encounters</i> takes them on a more inward
          journey—not ETs in metal ships (although those do hover in the
          background) but alleged interactions with nonhuman intelligence
          through dreams, synchronicities, and inspiration. Pasulka’s unique
          brand of erudite but also highly personal ufology humanizes her
          subject in a way that few other writers nowadays approach. Her cast of
          characters includes members of the scientific and technological elite,
          many of whom believe they have interacted with, or continuously
          interact with, the UFO Phenomenon. Some of her informants work on the
          forefront of fields like AI and space medicine that are poised to take
          our own species in new directions in coming years. Like Jacques Vallee
          at his best, Pasulka is a curious and sympathetic guide to her
          subjects’ dreamtimes, speculations, and spiritual landscapes."<br />
          —<b>Eric Wargo</b>, author of <i>Time Loops</i> and
          <i>Precognitive Dreamwork and the Long Self<br /></i> <br />"Diana
          Pasulka shifts the paradigm on what contact with nonhuman
          intelligences can mean and the social impacts it can have. She offers
          us a subtle, sensitive, and deeply knowledgeable depiction of the
          lives and worlds of people who have had experiences associated with
          UFOs. Particularly intriguing is the way she weaves Plato’s Allegory
          of the Cave throughout her narrative to illuminate various facets of
          the UFO phenomenon and speak to the esoteric knowledges at the core of
          contact with nonhuman intelligences. Pasulka shows us how the
          experiencers may be more relevant to our potential technological and
          spiritual futures than we have realized."<br />—<b
            >Hussein Ali Agrama, PhD.</b
          >, Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Chicago<br /><br />Praise
          for <i>American Cosmic</i>:<br />"[Pasulka] approaches UFO believers
          with an open mind in her irresistible debut . . . [and] gives
          wonderful, entertaining insight into the curious study of UFOs." —
