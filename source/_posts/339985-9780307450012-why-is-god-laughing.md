          In this refreshing new take on spirituality, bestselling author Deepak
          Chopra uses a fictional tale of a comedian and his unlikely mentor to
          show us a path back to hope, joy, and even enlightenment—with a lot of
          laughter along the way. <br /><br />Meet Mickey Fellows. A successful
          L.A. comedian, he’s just a regular guy, with his fair share of fears,
          egocentricities, and addictions. After his father’s death, Mickey
          meets a mysterious stranger named Francisco, who changes his life
          forever. The two begin an ongoing discussion about the true nature of
          being. Reluctantly at first, Mickey accepts the stranger’s help and
          starts to explore his own life in an effort to answer the riddles
          Francisco poses. Mickey starts to look at those aspects of himself
          that he has hidden behind a wall of wisecracks all his life.
          Eventually Mickey realizes that authentic humor opens him up to the
          power of spirit—allowing him to finally make real connections with
          people. <br /><br />After taking the reader on a journey with Mickey,
          Chopra then spells out the lessons that Mickey’s story imparts to us:
          ten reasons to be optimistic, even in our challenging world. Chopra
          believes that the healthiest response to life is laughter from the
          heart, and even in the face of global turmoil, we can cultivate an
          internal sense of optimism. Rich with humor and practical advice,
          <i>Why Is God Laughing?</i> shows us without a doubt that there is
          always a reason to be grateful, that every possibility holds the
          promise of abundance, and that obstacles are simply opportunities in
          disguise. In the end, we really don’t need a reason to be happy. The
          power of happiness lies within each of us, just waiting to be
          unleashed. And Mickey Fellows’s journey shows us the way.

          “<i>Why is God laughing? </i>Good question. Deepak takes us halfway to
          an answer, to a line in the sand. Then, after we’ve contemplated the
          parable of Mickey Fellows, we cross that line and arrive at the
          liberating answer on our own. What is it? I ain’t telling. Read the
          book yourself!”<br />—Dan Aykroyd, actor and comedian<br /><br />“<i
            >Why Is God Laughing?</i
          >
          deserves a standing ovation; I couldn’t put it down. Deepak Chopra has
          written another life-changing book that I will definitely recommend to
          everyone.”<br />—Mike Robles, Emmy Award–winning comedian; creator and
          executive producer of Que Locos and Loco Comedy Jam <br /><br />“If
          you’re skimming these quotes to see whether you’re going to buy this
          book, don’t bother. Just read a bit of chapter five!”<br />—John
          Cleese, actor and comedian
