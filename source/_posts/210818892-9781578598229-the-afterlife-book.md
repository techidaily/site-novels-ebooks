            >A profound and fascinating exploration of death and the afterlife!

          <p>
            What happens when we die? Many view it as a mystery, but there are
            tantalizing clues to be found in the Bible and other religious
            scriptures, scientific findings, historical writings, literature,
            reports of near-death experiences, and in many other recorded
            sources. Facing the contradictions and similarities of beliefs from
            all over the world and throughout history,
            <i><b>The Afterlife Book: Heaven, Hell, and Life After Death</b></i>
            shows how death and the afterlife is viewed in a variety of
            different ways. This engrossing guide looks at the many competing
            views of the afterlife—and the shared connections between them,
            including ...
          </p>
          <p></p>
          Where ideas of Heaven and Hell came from and why they endure.What
          happens during near death experiences and out of body experiences,What
          is known about reincarnation and immortality.How death is linked to
          ghosts and apparitions, mediumship, and spiritualism.How the quest for
          immortality and transhumanism may play a role in one day ending
          death.How science and spirituality can often say the same thing—only
          in different languages and terminologies.How death and the dead have
          been celebrated, memorialized, and honored in the past and
          present.What happens to the human body just before, during, and
          immediately after physical death.What happens to the cells, tissues,
          heart, and brain as a result of the physical process of dying and
          decomposition.How burial and cremation traditions, rites, rituals, and
          controversies address consciousness and the existence of a soul.What
          religious leaders, philosophers, and scientists have to say about
          consciousness and the soul.Whether animals and pets have souls.
          <p>
            Is death just a mysterious phase in our journey? Does it lead to
            Heaven (or Hell)? Is it reincarnation or simply eternal blackness
            and unconsciousness? Do we continue to exist in some form or other
            beyond our physical bodies? <i><b>The Afterlife Book</b></i> tackles
            these questions and gives us all hope that our lives do not come to
            an end but change like the natural cycles of birth, life, death, and
            rebirth! It’s many photos and illustrations help bring the text to
            life, and its helpful bibliography and extensive index add to its
            usefulness.
