            >A fresh, in-depth exploration of orbs, and what these mysterious
            circles of light wish to tell us<br /></b
          ><br />In the past decade people all over the world have become
          fascinated with orbs—the opaque circular features that appear
          unexpectedly in photographs. In fact, the popularity of this
          phenomenon has risen so much that serious research has been done on
          them. Books have been written about what they could be, how they’re
          produced, and all of the scientific aspects of these beautiful spheres
          of light. However, one question has gone unanswered: what does their
          appearance mean? <br /><br /><i
            >Orbs: Their Mission &amp; Messages of Hope</i
          >
          explains that these fascinating circles of light are here for a
          specific purpose—to bring us hope. Written by orb expert and former
          Stanford and NASA materials science researcher Klaus Heinemann,
          together with his wife, Gundi Heinemann, a healing arts practitioner,
          this book is a grounded and visionary presentation of facts and
          experiences in orb photography. They offer convincing new results
          addressing the skeptic and numerous reports of meaningful orb
          encounters from people all over the world. <br /><br />This book
          delves deep into the magical and exciting world of orbs—how and when
          they appear to us—and explores what these emanations from Spirit
          Beings are trying to communicate.

          “The phenomenon of the orbs shows us that we are moving in a spiritual
          dimension that by far exceeds our ordinary perception of the way
          things are. This field of unlimited potential, which is accessible,
          friendly, and reliable toward us, becomes visible through the orbs.
          Klaus and Gundi Heinemann impressively document this with many
          examples and photos in this book. It opens our eyes.”<br /><b

          >&nbsp;author, originator of Hellinger Family Constellations, founder
          of Hellinger Sciencia<br /><br />“When Anthonie van Leeuwenhoek used
          the microscope to introduce us to bacteria and microorganisms, he
          opened another dimension. Now we are being introduced to yet another
          mysterious dimension, that of the orb. I expect this new experience
          will yield an even more exciting world than did the microscope. Here
          you will find unequaled beauty and mystery!”<br /><b

          >, professor of energy medicine, president emeritus, Holos University
          Graduate Seminary<br /><br />“Crystal-clear science, heartful stories,
          and amazing photos that capture both the mystery and the realness of
          the orb phenomena. A timely and well-conceived contribution to
          encourage us all to open to the presence of loving spirits in our
          lives.”<br /><b>— Emma Bragdon, Ph.D.</b>, author of&nbsp;<i

          films A Tribute to John of Godand Spiritism: Bridging Spirituality and
          Health<br /><br />“Orbs miraculously appear in hundreds of thousands
          of photos all over the world. In&nbsp;<i
            >Orbs: Their Mission and Messages of Hope</i
          >, Klaus and Gundi Heinemann present a beautiful symbiosis of the
          factual and the intuitive. If you are looking for a glimpse into the
          meaning and messages behind this phenomenon, this is the book to
          read.”<br /><b>— Richard Bartlett, D.C., N.D.</b>, founder and author
          of&nbsp;<i>Matrix Energetics</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i
            >The Physics of Miracles</i
          ><br /><br />“Who hasn't been delighted when orbs appeared unannounced
          in their photographs? Yet, in&nbsp;<i
            >Orbs: Their Mission and Messages of Hope</i
          >, we come to appreciate these phenomena at a much deeper level,
          recognizing their role in interdimensional communication. Through
          beautiful photography and touching stories, the authors skillfully
          evoke within us the mystery of our existence. They suggest it’s time
          to stop asking ‘how’ and, instead, embrace the opportunity for
          spiritual evolution that the spirit beings within the orbs, are
          offering us. An excellent book!”<br /><b>— Christine Page, M.D.</b>,
