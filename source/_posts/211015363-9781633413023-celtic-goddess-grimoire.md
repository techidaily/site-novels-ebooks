          “Infused with sacred practices, meditations, and rituals,
          <i>Celtic Goddess Grimoire </i>is a must read for anyone seeking to
          cultivate a meaningful relationship with the divine feminine across
          the Celtic landscape.”<br />
          —Danielle Blackwood, author of <i>The Twelve Faces of the Goddess</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Welcome to the world of the Celtic feminine divine! Within these
          pages, you will meet great goddesses such as Brigid, the Morrigan,
          Sulis, Rhiannon, Rosmerta, and Elen of the Ways, as well as faery
          women like Melusine and Morgan Le Fae.
          <i>Celtic Goddess Grimoire </i>introduces you to goddesses of magic
          like Cerridwen, Arianrhod, and Blodeuwedd, as well as goddesses of
          justice, healing, and sovereignty. This book also explores the Ladies
          of the Lake, including the original Lake Lady from
          <i>The Mabinogi</i>. It shines a spotlight on the most prominent
          Celtic female divinities but also includes a section devoted to
          lesser-known goddesses of the Celtic world, such as the mysterious
          Nehalennia, who was nearly lost before her shrine was recovered from
          the depths of the North Sea.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          A practical guide to working with these sacred beings, this book
          includes exercises for celebrating, honoring, and serving them. Author
          Annwyn Avalon provides chants, rituals, spells, and meditations. Learn
          how to build altars, craft charms, and actively invoke these Celtic
          goddesses so that they become a living, vital presence in your
          spiritual life. Annwyn also provides information about the meanings of
          the names of these sacred beings, their sacred symbols and creatures,
          as well as their personal powers, realms of strongest influence, and
          historical context.<br />
