          Lee and Glenn Perry created a new product, a new company and a global
          industry. Their book tracks the floatation industry and cultural
          movement from the seed of the Perrys' own experiences as floaters
          through the design, prototyping, manufacture, and distribution of
          float tanks to individuals and public float centers around the world.
          They have changed not only their lives but the lives of many of those
          who float.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Glenn Perry&nbsp;grew up on a farm and became a systems computer
          programmer. He moved on to designing and building float tanks with Dr.
          Lilly's support and blessing. He also has strong interests in
          biodynamic farming, sustainable living, and personal
          development.&nbsp;Lee Perry has been a dancer, a student, and a
          professional teacher of special needs children. Glenn Perry grew up on
          a farm which taught him problem solving, useful when he became a
          systems computer programmer. He was one of a handful of people who
          designed a time sharing system on a mainframe computer used at the
          beginning of the internet. He was so affected by his first use of Dr.
          John C. Lilly’s isolation tank in Los Angeles that he got Dr. Lilly’s
          support and blessing to manufacture tanks commercially. Floating
          allowed Glenn to develop the first deep relationship in his 33 years.
          Lee and Glenn’s relationship with each other, their relationship with
          Dr. Lilly, their explorations of higher states of consciousness, and
          the quality of their life are all included in this book. Glenn
          continues to be blessed by insights from John that are life changing.
          Lee Perry has been a dancer, a student and a professional teacher of
          special needs children. Having received her M.A. from Univ. of
          Southern California, she was teaching full time in the Los Angeles
          school system when she discovered floating. In Lee’s words: “All the
          amazing experiences I had as the mother of three courageous, talented,
          intelligent offspring—exposure to good food, music, dance, nature,
          travel, art and literature—prepared me for my life as the President of
          Samadhi Tank Company and the duties that came with it: introducing and
          nourishing the uses of the floatation tank to millions of floaters
          changing their lives.” Glenn Perry&nbsp;grew up on a farm and became a
          systems computer programmer. He moved on to designing and building
          float tanks with Dr. Lilly's support and blessing. He also has strong
          interests in biodynamic farming, sustainable living, and personal
          development.&nbsp;Lee Perry has been a dancer, a student, and a
          professional teacher of special needs children.
