            “The Akashic Records contain everything that every soul has ever
            thought, said, and done over the course of its existence—as well as
            all its future possibilities. This valuable information can help you
            with any aspect of your life journey. And because the Records are
            also a dimension of consciousness, they are available anytime and
            everywhere.”<br />—Linda Howe<br />The universe is alive—and it has
            a memory just like you. Known as the Akashic Records, this energetic
            archive of soul information stands ready to lovingly guide you. Once
            accessible to rare spiritual masters, now the Records are available
            to anyone—anytime, anywhere.<br />After a lifelong search for truth,
            master teacher and healer Linda Howe has developed an infallible
            method for accessing this reservoir of information: the Pathway
            Prayer Process. By lifting you to a divine level of consciousness,
            this sacred prayer opens the doors of the Records, where your “soul
            blueprint”—everything you need to know about your soul's
            destiny—awaits you. There you will work with your Masters, Teachers,
            and Loved Ones to cultivate a rich relationship with the Records,
            and ultimately learn to unleash your highest potential.<br />Grounded
            with the success stories of dozens of people whose lives have been
            touched by the Records, this comprehensive guidebook will help you
            confidently read the Records for yourself—or another—and find
            inspiration for your own spiritual path.<br />“Accessing the Akashic
            Records provides an opportunity to align with your soul and develop
            your own spiritual authority,” teaches Linda Howe. Now with How to
            Read the Akashic Records, you can learn to connect with this divine
            source for infinite joy, inner peace, and fulfillment.<br />Linda
            Howe is the founder and director of The Center for Akashic Studies,
            an organization dedicated to promoting the study of Akashic Records
            and other applicable spiritual wisdom. Active in the healing arts
            for more than 20 years, Linda was moved and inspired by the power of
            the Records within herself and her clients. She began teaching this
            practice to students in 1996, and since then she has successfully
            taught thousands of students to accurately read the Akashic Records.
