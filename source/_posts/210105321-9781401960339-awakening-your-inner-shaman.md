            >A powerful debut from one of the world's most respected shamanic
            teachers, following Marcela Lobos's journey in this world and the
            world of spirit.</b
          ><br /><br />The stress, conflict, and crises of the outer world are a
          signal: the time has come to awaken your inner shaman. However, you
          don't need to be initiated into arcane mysteries to answer the call
          from Spirit. In this book, Marcela Lobos reveals how to use the maps
          offered by the shamanic Medicine Wheel and the hero's journey to
          activate your inner wisdom and live a self-realized existence of
          discovery, healing, and wholeness.<br /><br />From her childhood in a
          war-torn country to her initiation with the shamans of the Andes and
          her life today as a teacher and medicine woman, Marcela's story offers
          a flesh-and-bones context for each step on the archetypal journey to
          Self. It is also an invitation to step out from your ordinary life and
          take the first steps on your own quest for spiritual understanding and
          deep transformation: to learn to walk the Medicine Path and to find
          your own power and inner beauty.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Marcela Lobos</b> has been initiated in the healing and spiritual
          traditions of the Amazon and the Andes. She was born and raised in
          Chile, where she leads expeditions, working with women shamans who
          belong to a matriarchal society that still holds the wisdom and
          passion of Mother Earth. She is senior teacher at the Four Winds
          Society and is married to its founder, Alberto Villoldo. Together they
          travel throughout the United States and Europe, teaching the wisdom of
          the Medicine Wheel. They founded Los Cuatro Caminos in South America
          to share the same wisdom in Spanish. Marcela is passionate about
          taking women through rites of passage that allow them to find their
          power, grace, and wisdom.
