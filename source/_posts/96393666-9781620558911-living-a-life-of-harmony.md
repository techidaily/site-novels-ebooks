          7 simple yet powerful guidelines provide a compass for navigating life
          harmoniously, cultivating a peaceful mind, and spreading kindness
          <br /><br />• Offers 7 guidelines for living a life of harmony and
          peace based on existing guidance from Buddhism, Yoga, and other great
          teachings, integrated and updated for the modern world <br /><br />•
          Explains how to implement the guidelines in daily life on a practical
          basis, supported by real-life examples and practices <br /><br />•
          Illustrates in-depth how and why each of these guidelines hold value
          and how they provide a set of tools to help us deal with life’s ups
          and downs more skillfully, mindfully, and compassionately<br /><br />
          In our very busy world it’s easy to get lost in the details and
          demands of everyday living. Fatigued and overwhelmed by the sheer
          amount of information, the myriad of choices our technologically
          advanced communication era offers, we lose sight of what life is all
          about. How do we find balance and harmony in this overloaded world?
          And how do we navigate life in tune with our soul as well as with
          modern society?<br /><br />
          As author Darren Cockburn explains, we are all part of one big
          universal process that encompasses and connects everything--every
          thought, emotion, action, nature, all there is. Over the centuries,
          religions and philosophies have provided direction on how to act
          ethically and in accordance with this process, yet in our modern
          world, these “rules” may seem outdated or too rigid. Integrating and
          updating existing guidance from Buddhism, Yoga, and other great
          teachings, the author offers 7 guidelines for living a life of harmony
          and balance: honor the body, bring awareness and acceptance into every
          moment, act with kindness, understand the truth and communicate it
          skillfully, do only what needs to be done, harmoniously obtain and
          retain only what you need, and apply the guidelines to your digital
          device usage. He illustrates how and why each of these guidelines hold
          value, revealing their interconnections, and explains how to implement
          them practically in daily life, sharing real-life examples as well as
          practices to support each guideline and deepen your existing spiritual
          practice. <br /><br />The author explores how the 7 easy-to-practice
          guidelines help us gain a deeper understanding of the universal
          process of life, as well as provide a set of tools to help us deal
          with life’s ups and downs more skillfully. They enable us to face life
          empowered and confident, peacefully observe and accept what life
          presents us with, cultivate compassion and kindness, as well as spread
          mindfulness to those around us. Practiced together, these guidelines
          provide a simple yet powerful compass to guide you to a peaceful mind
          and harmonious living, much needed in today’s world.

          “<i>Living a Life of Harmony</i> is a handbook for everyday living!
          Darren explains how life is one big universal process, which he calls
          ‘The Process,’ and how everything is connected. While reading this
          book, I felt as if I was being gently and lovingly walked through each
          part of The Process, step-by-step, at my own pace. I felt empowered
          and confident in the choices I was making, as I had a structured way
          of assessing each choice so that it would have a positive effect, not
          only on myself but on those around me. This book has transformed how I
          approach my everyday life and I highly recommend it.”
