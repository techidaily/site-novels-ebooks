            Chakras have been a vital part of healing practices and techniques
            from ancient times, yogis have worked with the chakra system for
            hundreds of years. You might have an idea that illness is taken as
            an energy blockage in most of the chakras. Many healing modalities,
            like acupuncture, also considers the blocked flow of energy as a
            root cause of all the diseases.

            For instance, if you let the dirt go into the clean swimming pool,
            after a time, the whole water becomes dirty. The same goes for the
            human body, but it is difficult to unblock your chakras as dirty
            water can be filtered again due to its physical structure, but
            human's energy blockage is spiritual.
