            >“If there is one quote from this book which deserves to be
            emblazoned on the opening pages of your Book of Shadows; above the
            door of your house (or temple); and in every mind it is this: ‘Wicca
            is not a place to go, it is a journey to take.’”—Spiral Nature</b
          ><br /><br />For thousands of years, we have been told that God was a
          man. Then someone reminded us of when God was a woman. Now we have a
          reference for the sensible folk who have always felt that it takes
          two. If you have ever thought there was more to religion than ancient
          rituals performed for reasons unknown, this book will show you exactly
          what you have been looking for. If you have already come to the
          realization that Wicca is the religion for you, this book will help
          fill those many blanks that have been left by other books.<br /><br />Author
          A.J. Drew makes no attempt to dictate religious dogma or routine. He
          is quick to point out that the title does not start with the word the.
          He illustrates the many issues a person’s religion should address and
          shows how he has been able to find answers to those issues through the
          practice of a modern religion that was based on some of the oldest
          principles of the ancient world.<br /><br /><i>A Wiccan Bible</i>
          takes you through the journey of life in three stages:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;Maiden and Master: Creation, Wiccaning, and Self-dedication.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;Mother and Father: Initiation, Handfasting/Handparting, and the
          Wheel of the Year.<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Crone and Sage: Community,
          the world, and death.<br /><br />Mythology and science converge as the
          author details a life’s journey into a religion with both old world
          ritual and new world science, fusing both into a creation myth which
          satisfies not only mind, but soul as well.<i> A Wiccan Bible</i> not
          only shows a religious path filled with joy, but one that offers the
          ability to accept and manage sorrow. It is filled with ritual and with
          the reasons why ritual is fulfilling, rewarding, and a necessary part
          of everyday life. As A.J. addresses each issue, he demonstrates not
          only how he found the solutions in Wicca, and the many ways in which
          science and magick have helped him to do so.
          <i>A Wiccan Bible </i>also contains select recipes that the author has
          collected, including mixtures for incense, oils, and baths.
