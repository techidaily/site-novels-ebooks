              we die?</strong

          <p>
            Based on her own experiences following the death of her mother,
            Jenny Vanbergen walks through a compelling and thoughtful discussion
            on the possibility of life after death.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the works of many renowned thinkers, such as Carl Jung, The
            Homes of the Soul takes an analytical approach as it discusses
            theories such as the psyche, the ego, personal and collective
            unconscious and the holographic universe in relation to the
            possibility of life after death.
          </p>
          <p>
            The books deals with complex theories, while still remaining clear
            and accessible. Vanbergen’s warm yet scientific - and at times
            humorous - approach to dealing with such immense questions will
            bring comfort to those dealing with grief, but also appeal to anyone
            interested in analytical psychology or ideas surrounding the
            afterlife.

          "This fascinating short book tells the alluring account of one woman's
          encounter with the life and work of CG Jung and how she has been
          guided by his inquiries into the true nature of the human spirit. Her
          personal experiences around the death of her mother lead her to read
          what Jung wrote about his supernatural experiences and all the layers
          of existence below the surface of life in the material world... She
          doesn't seem to come to any overt conclusion but you feel the world is
          a richer place by the end of the book.&nbsp; It deals with big
          subjects but it isn't academic.&nbsp; In fact it's full of anecdotes -
          mostly from Jung - and is an enjoyable read."<br /><strong

          “The Homes of The Soul is a wondrous book in which Vanbergen takes us
          on a thrilling adventure of consciousness, integrating scientific
          understanding and Jungian depth psychology. This is a book for all
          Jungians, particularly for those who want to pick up where Jung left
          off... where he felt the most exciting developments in his great work
          might lie.”<br /><strong>Jasbinder Garnermann</strong>, director of
          the C G Jung Centre, Ireland.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Vanbergen describes and then goes beyond her own experiences of
          grief, to make an argument for the real possibility of life after
          death, an idea that mainstream thinking often rejects. However, it is
          by combining mainstream Jungian ideas with a modern theory of
          consciousness that she makes her entertaining and intriguing case.”<br /><strong

          “The Homes of the Soul is an illuminating journey into the realms of
          grief, spirituality and the human psyche. Jennifer Vanbergen offers
          readers a profound understanding of the transformative power of loss.
          This book is<br />a valuable resource for anyone seeking solace,
          self-discovery and a deeper understanding of the profound connection
          between grief and personal growth.”<br /><strong

          “I enjoyed this book immensely. We are taken down a logical path to
          consider ourselves from different points of view in time. The works of
          Carl Jung and many others are artfully woven into creating answers to
          the question of an afterlife. Brilliant.“<br /><strong
