              ><b>Gold&nbsp;Nautilus Book Award Winner </b><br /><br />Restoring
              your body, mind, and spirit amid change is an act of courage,
              empowerment, and hope. This warm,&nbsp;powerful&nbsp;guide will
              help you honor the changes and spaces in your life with purposeful
              rest and reflection.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />If you're trying to push your way through endings,
          beginnings, and places of uncertainty, only to find yourself more
          confused, disconnected, tired, and uncertain, this book will hold and
          fortify you. Yoga teacher and activist Octavia Raheem offers us the
          motivation and guidance we need to restore ourselves in the midst of
          all sorts of change.&nbsp;Change in our lives—whether it be welcome,
          joyful, challenging, or more subtle—presents us with the opportunity
          to pause and gather our energy to work with whatever lies
          ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Drawing wisdom from yoga
          philosophy and her many years of teaching experience, Raheem offers us
          the motivation and guidance we need to restore ourselves in the midst
          of all&nbsp;types&nbsp;of change.&nbsp; She gives us three simple
          restorative yoga poses (savasana, side lying pose, and child’s pose),
          and offers short teachings, reflections, and practices to see us
          through times of ending, beginning, and&nbsp;liminal/transitional
          space. She&nbsp;shows us&nbsp;how slowing down, stillness, and
          deeper&nbsp;connection to our own transitions empower us to move
          through collective shifts with more grace—and what it means to
          navigate shifts and change with presence and courage.

          “Octavia Raheem has the authentic, searing voice of a teacher who is
          intimate with the mercurial nature of transformation.
          <i>Pause, Rest, Be</i> contains powerful stories, expertly guided
          restorative postures, and anchors for self-study and reflection.
          Radical, meaningful, and practical medicine for a volatile, rapidly
          changing world.”—Bo Forbes, Psy.D., E-RYT, C-IAYT author of
          <i>Yoga for Emotional Balance</i> <br /><br />“In need of an inner
          reset? Look no further than <i>Pause, Rest, Be.</i> Octavia’s wise and
          honest teachings put the reader at ease and give us permission to
          embrace more of our true self than we ever thought possible.”—Light
          Watkins, author of <i>Knowing Where to Look</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “It's not an exaggeration to say that<i> Pause, Rest, Be</i> is life
          changing. Like a restorative backward bend, our heart opens and heals
          with the support of Octavia Raheem's words. This book is like a song,
          and could be called ‘Octavia's Gita.’ How lucky we are to hear her
          siren song, drawing us back to the truth of our essential
          self.”—Jivana Heyman, author of <i>Accessible Yoga</i> and
          <i>Yoga Revolution</i><br />
          <br />
          “<i>Pause, Rest, Be</i> emerged from an old, wise, ancestral place. It
          contains prayers, musings, teachings, and practices that coax us into
          allowing ourselves to slow down, develop a more
          intimate&nbsp;relationship with ourselves, and most importantly, rest.
          It is clear Octavia Raheem channeled Spirit as she was writing the
          gift that is <i>Pause, Rest, Be</i> because each section, prayer,
          practice, and word feels as if it is infused with Spirit. Raheem
          offers a different way for us to see endings, the between space, and
          beginnings. It is the reframe we need at this time. It is the
          medicine, the spell, the potent potion that will heal us
          all.”—Michelle C. Johnson, author of <i>Skill in Action</i> and
          <i>Finding Refuge</i><br /><br />
          “This book is a prayer that invites us all to be still enough to
          notice that each transition&nbsp;is a portal to healing, remembering,
          and knowing. Octavia Raheem weaves practices and sacred wisdom&nbsp;in
          practical ways that honor where we are at any given moment on our
          journey.”—Tracee Stanley,<i> </i>author of<i> Radiant Rest</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “A sacred call inward—home to yourself. <i>Pause, Rest, Be</i> is a
          poetic prayer of real-life wisdom, and the depth of stillness is felt
          on the page. Octavia's words are a soothing invitation for us&nbsp;to
          courageously do what most of us fiercely resist: slowing down, letting
          go, and listening. Whether you are mourning the loss of an old life,
          in the midst of vast uncertainty, or beginning a new chapter, this
          book will support you to soften, feel, rest, and move closer to the
          truth of who you are.”—Shannon Algeo, author of <i>Trust Your Truth</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Place this book on your nightstand or altar. But wherever you place
          it, keep it close at hand. It is a banquet, a feast for the soul. Turn
          to any page and be fed by the wisdom of the ages. Inspired and
          inspiring, this is a brilliant offering from Octavia Raheem.”—Gail
          Parker, PhD, author of
          <i>Restorative Yoga for Ethnic and Race-Based Stress and Trauma,</i>
          and <i>Transforming Ethnic and Race-Based Trauma with Yoga.</i
          ><br /><br />
          “Part practice, part poetry, this book will feed your soul. Octavia is
          a magnificent&nbsp;voice of truth. In a sea of overachievement,
          Octavia reminds us that rest is just as powerful as action, and that
          through rest, we can align to an even greater sense truth.”—Justin
          Michael Williams,<i> </i>author of <i>Stay Woke</i><br /><br />“For
          those of us who carry the weight of the world on our shoulder and in
          our hearts, Octavia Raheem's words offer a call to rest that is not
          about denial or selfishness, but instead is about the rest that is
          required if we are to live fully and embrace the complexity of our
          shared humanity. <i>Pause, Rest, Be</i> is an antidote to a culture of
          speed and burnout (often rooted in trauma), and a call to remember who
          we really are and can be.”—Hala Khouri, M.A., SEP, E-RYT author of
          <i>Peace from Anxiety</i><br /><br />“This inspiring guide helps
          readers honor life’s detours with hope, reflection, and renewed
          joy.”—<i>Woman’s World</i>
