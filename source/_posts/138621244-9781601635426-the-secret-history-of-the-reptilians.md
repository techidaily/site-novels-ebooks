          ><b>—Philip Coppens, author of <i>The Ancient Alien Question</i></b
          ><br /><br />Where the bloodlines of the Nephilim leave off, the real
          story just begins.<br /><br />Or does it go back even further than
          that?<br /><br />The very real probability that non-human
          intelligences visited and even copulated with primordial humans is
          detailed in civilization's most ancient cultural and religious
          records. These historical records further reveal that these
          intelligences were reptilian in nature--or, at the very least, have
          been represented throughout human history in reptilian form.<br /><br />From
          the Serpent, Nawcash, in the Garden of Eden; Atum, the Egyptian
          snake-man; and Quetzalcotl, the feathered serpent god of the Mayans to
          the double-helix snake symbol of Enki/Ea in ancient Sumerian
          literature, the serpent has been the omnipresent link between humans
          and the gods in every culture.<br /><br />In
          <i>The Secret History of the Reptilians</i>, Scott Alan Roberts
          investigates and examines the pervasive presence of the serpent in
          human history, religion, culture, and politics.<br /><br />Are we the
          product of an extraterrestrial race that moves and breathes--and even
          breeds--beneath the surface of all of human history?<br /><br />Put on
          your thinking cap and take an historical, anthropological,
          archaeological plunge into the heady waters of extraterrestrial
          origins.
