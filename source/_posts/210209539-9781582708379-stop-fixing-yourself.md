            >Can you imagine how liberating it would be to never be
            disillusioned again, never be disappointed again, never feel let
            down again? Want to wake up, come alive, and be free? Anthony De
            Mello’s&nbsp;<i>Stop Fixing Yourself</i>&nbsp;is the answer you have
            been looking for.</b
          ><br /><br />The question Anthony De Mello’s&nbsp;<i
            >Stop Fixing Yourself</i
          >&nbsp;poses and successfully answers is:&nbsp;<i
            >Can you attain enlightenment without the slightest effort on your
            part?&nbsp;</i
          >Spiritual seekers exhausted from years of fruitless striving might
          well sigh deeply and think, “If only that were true.” Well, Anthony De
          Mello asserts it&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;true.&nbsp;<i
            >Stop Fixing Yourself: Wake Up, All Is Well</i
          >&nbsp;provides the simple path to living an enlightened life.<br />
          <br />
          De Mello tells us that if you are watchful and awake, all that is
          false and neurotic within you will drop away and you will begin to
          live increasingly from moment to moment in a life made whole and happy
          and transparent through awareness. Awareness transforms you from a
          seeker to a finder, opening your eyes to the reality of the love,
          peace, and beauty that has always surrounded you. Awareness will set
          you free.<br />
          <br />
          In&nbsp;<i>Stop Fixing Yourself</i>, De Mello’s down-to-earth teaching
          method helps you discover true awareness, releasing the divinity all
          around you and making your life meaningful, beautiful, and prosperous.

        <p>
          <b>Anthony De Mello</b> was a Jesuit priest born in Bombay, India, in
          1931. He is regarded as one of the foremost spiritual teachers of the
          twentieth century, respected widely for his groundbreaking and
          enduring work that integrates Western and Eastern spirituality. De
          Mello founded the Sadhana Institute in India and is the author of the
          bestselling masterpieces <i>Awareness</i> and <i>The Way to Love</i>,
          along with eleven other books that have been translated into
          twenty-one languages and have sold more than two million copies
          worldwide. His large body of work continues to have impact beyond his
          untimely death in 1987. Some of our era’s most acclaimed spiritual
          teachers have acknowledged the liberating and elevating impact of De
          Mello’s practical spirituality, including Rhonda Byrne, Eckhart Tolle,
          Neil Strauss, Adyashanti, Thomas Moore, and Paulo Coelho. Visit the De
