            >A heartfelt guide for meeting difficult times with mindfulness,
            compassion, and courage—from a psychotherapist and Buddhist
            practitioner who learned from her own crisis.<br /><br />Features
            explorations of the three types of fear and practices to transform
            into opportunities for personal growth.</b
          ><br /><br />This heartfelt guide transforms challenging times into
          surmountable journeys that we can emerge from by learning how to work
          with—rather than against—fear. Drawing from traditional Buddhist
          teachings on the <i>bardo</i>, a Tibetan word most often associated
          with the period between death and rebirth, Buddhist practitioner Susan
          Gillis Chapman offers guidance for those times when life seems to turn
          upside down. Amidst such difficulties—whether it’s navigating the end
          of a relationship, a health scare, or other unexpected challenges—the
          fearful mind tends to panic. But Chapman, informed by her years
          working as psychotherapist, skillfully intercepts our uncertainty to
          show how we can let go of assumptions and allow something new to be
          reborn.<br /><br />Using personal examples from her own bardo
          crisis—navigating a cancer diagnosis during the pandemic—and offering
          contemplative prompts for inner-reflection and meditation practices
          throughout, she demystifies the main kinds of fear people experience
          and reveals how to meet them with love. This powerful resource will
          help restore equilibrium when life feels chaotic, and what’s more,
          uncover truly transformative opportunities for personal growth in even
          the most difficult circumstances.

          “When Susan received a diagnosis of cancer during the isolating years
          of the Covid pandemic, she was able to draw on her years of Buddhist
          training for support. In this book, she shares the insights and
          practices that sustained her in dealing with the initial shock of the
          diagnosis and throughout the challenges of treatment. Susan structures
          her book around the teachings of <i>bardos</i>, or what she calls
          times of ‘rude awakening.’ Her book is unique in its straightforward
          discussion of fear and the power of compassionate wisdom to move
          through fear to healing. It is a great resource not only for cancer
          patients but for anyone going through an abrupt or startling
          transition in life.”<br />
          —<b>Judith Lief</b>, author of <i>Making Friends with Death</i><br />
          <i> </i><br />
          “Forged by the fires of direct experience, and buttressed by decades
          of deep meditative practice, this is a profound and practical journey
          of the heart crafted by a spiritual warrior. Susan Chapman deftly
          translates the Buddhist teachings on the bardo into language you can
          understand and immediately apply to the challenges of life. If you
          want to learn how to transform obstacle into opportunity, this book is
          for you.” <br />
          —<b>Andrew Holecek</b>, author of <i>Reverse Meditation</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This book is like a wise old friend accompanying us in the most
          difficult of times. Susan Gillis Chapman goes right to the heart of
          our deepest fears, sharing her own story in a way that sheds light on
          our greatest moments of suffering and invites us to allow the journey
          to be transformative. She offers clear practices and insights that
          serve as signposts to guide the reader through difficulty with
          compassion and fierce love.”<br />
          —<b>Hala Khouri</b>, author of <i>Peace from Anxiety</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “With a warrior’s strength and a mother’s tenderness, Susan Chapman
          takes us on her cancer journey, from the paralyzing grip of fear to
          the open expanse of love, framed by the traditional bardo teachings.
          This is a compelling book.”<br />
          &nbsp;—<b>Irini Rockwell</b>, author of <i>The Five Wisdom Energies</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In this tumultuous age of global uncertainty,
          <i>Which Way Is Up?</i> invites us to dive deep down into our
          collective heartbreak in order to resource from the fertile and
          regenerative depths of meditation practice. Susan Gillis Chapman
          offers steadfast compassion, grace, clarity, and a generous invitation
          for growth. She supports the reader each step of the way, as she
          offers the medicine of seeing and perceiving more clearly, from the
          heart, as an alternative to feeding fear, reactivity, and overwhelm.
          She invites us to come home to peace with our ever-changing world and
          human experience and to move from a fear-based response to freedom of
          the heart.”<br />
          —<b>Deborah Eden Tull</b>, author of <i>Luminous Darkness</i><br />
          <i> </i><br />
          “Enlisting the basics of contemplative psychology, Susan guides her
          readers into embodied listening, the discovery of innate bravery, and
          the capacity to strengthen compassion in the face of real challenges.
          This book offers compassionate wisdom—directly from the heart—and will
          benefit anyone undergoing groundless times.”&nbsp;<br />
