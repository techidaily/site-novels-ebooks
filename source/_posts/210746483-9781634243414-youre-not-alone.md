          This book is not just a single story from one person; it covers a vast
          cross section of both bereaved mothers and fathers, from all
          backgrounds. This highlights to the reader (if they have experienced
          loss) that they are not alone. They are given a community of support
          to help strengthen themselves against feelings of shame, guilt,
          depression, and isolation. They are given ideas about what might help
          them to manage their pain, and give them hope that the vastness of the
          despair they feel will not always engulf them so wholly. Not only does
          the book address aiding those who are grieving, but also, in donated
          proceeds, it helps to fund the research that will reduce these tragic
          instances in the future.

        <p>
          Michelle Fulton was born in Vancouver, Canada. She is a musician and
          author but most importantly, she is a mother to her daughter, Bella
          Soleil, and her son, Turner. In February 2020, her second son, Cole
          Vaughn Taylor, passed away just days before his due date. The
          experience drove her to speak out to promote awareness about pregnancy
          loss, not only to help herself cope, but to aid those who have
          experienced such loss in the past as well as those who will in the
          future, and to highlight the need for deeper research into the subject
          in hopes it can reduce such tragic outcomes in the future. Michelle
