          Poems and commentary that open the door for a new generation to
          experience the ecstatic and embodied spiritual truths contained in
          Rumi’s poetry <br />
          <br />• Reveals how the four practices of eating lightly, breathing
          deeply, moving freely, and gazing intently can invoke the divinity
          within us all <br />
          <br />• Explains how these practices dissolve the self’s need for
          identity so that we may experience a state of transcendent ecstasy and
          union with the divine <br />
          <br />• Takes Rumi’s path to finding God from theoretical to embodied
          practices <br />
          <br />The great thirteenth-century Sufi mystic and poet Jalaluddin
          Rumi began his life as an orthodox Islamic believer but felt that to
          fully experience complete union with the divine he must abandon
          institutionalized religion and its prescribed forms of worship.
          Surrendering his will to his overriding urge for a much more
          immediate, intuitive, and compelling union with the divine, he found
          that by manipulating certain behavioral aspects of his
          physiology--eating lightly, breathing deeply, moving freely, and
          gazing raptly--he was capable of loosening the rigid confines of the
          self, thereby overriding its limitations and achieving a transcendent
          merging with his own divinity. <br />
          <br />His message is simple: if you wish to affect the spirit, you
          must first make changes in the way your body responds to the world.
          Through clearly written commentary interspersed with Rumi’s beautiful
          poems, this book details these four practices in a very precise way.
          As such, it is a sweet and open invitation to follow the examples set
          forth in order to embark upon one’s own path of inner illumination.
          The freshness of Rumi’s poetry dissolves the 700 years that separate
          his life from our own time, making his message as pertinent today as
          when he walked the streets of Konya, Anatolia (present-day Turkey),
          reciting his inspiring verse. This book allows us, through Rumi’s
          gentle guidance, to touch the face of God that resides deep within us
          all.

          “Rumi speaks with the voice of our own age and our own hearts. Nowhere
          is this more clear than in this compelling and moving book by one of
          the most interesting, innovative, and creative spiritual thinkers and
          practitioners of our time. I recommend Will Johnson’s guidance into
          Rumi’s world to all who seek the freedom and joy that Rumi offers.”
