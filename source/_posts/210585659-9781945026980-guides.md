          <p>
            Are you ready to create your most infinite and magical life
            experience? Psychic medium Marilyn Alauria explains how all of life
            offers information for your personal journey, and your guides are
            here to help communicate it to you. Guides can be ascended beings,
            deceased loved ones, angels, animals, nature, planets, colors, or
            beings from other dimensions and star systems. When you approach
            life from a limitless consciousness, you will be amazed at the
            guidance you have access to.

          <p>
            Guides answer the questions inside of you and help you remember who
            you are and why you are here. They reflect your highest truths and
            the loving universe we live in. Be delighted and inspired as Marilyn
            Alauria and our sacred storytellers share their mystical connections
            with their guides, including:

          This is the best book I've read about guides - how to connect in with
          yours, understand how they can help you, and apply their guidance in
          all areas of your life.&nbsp;It serves as&nbsp;your personal guide to
          show you exactly what you need to know about&nbsp;a different world
          that could easily escape you. I especially enjoyed the simple and
          effective practices to deepen your relationship with your
          guides.&nbsp;I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking&nbsp;to
          surrender into a new level of deep inner listening.&nbsp;-

          Marilyn's masterful teaching shines through in her book GUIDES. You
          are sure to find your own language and relationship with your personal

          This book offers a comprehensive introduction to the different types
          of spiritual guides, from the angelic to animal spirits, while also
          offering tools and insights on how to&nbsp;intuitively connect with
          them. I appreciate the touching personal anecdotes that share
          individual interactions with angels, ascended&nbsp;beings, and other
          real-life inspirational stories. They serve as a great reminder that
          the Divine is always with us and this book shows us how to tap
          incorporate&nbsp;this guidance into our daily lives. -
