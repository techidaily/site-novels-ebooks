            Learn to express your soul's longing, delve into images that awaken
            your imagination, and speak of a truth yet unexplored. Allow Art
            &amp; Yoga to take you on a journey to your intuitive, creative and
            authentic self! Yogis will find creative exercises to deepen their
            experience of yoga, while artists will discover simple, yet profound
            yoga and meditation practices that will help their creative flow,
            focus, and intuition.

            For anyone interested in yoga and the arts, this book explains how
            to create a daily Art and Yoga practice, providing step-by-step
            guidelines for producing art and doing yoga as complementary
            practices individually, in a group, or in a community. Along the
            way, we draw inspiration from the teachings of Yogi Bhajan, nature,
            artists of the past, and recent developments in healing and
            spirituality.

            There is no need to know how to draw, paint, meditate, or do yoga to
            use this book. The art exercises are designed to make the experience
            accessible and fun, while also introducing a variety of inexpensive,
            safe, and easy-to-obtain art materials. Any experience you bring to
            the process will be helpful. If you teach yoga or art or if you work
            as a healer, you'll find inspiration and practical ways to deepen
            your professional practice.

            "Art &amp; Yoga is a beautiful, clear, and useful book. It presents
            an accessible practice of yoga and art for healing oneself and one's
            community." -Deepak Chopra

            "I am happy that Hari Kirin Kaur has created such a beautiful and
            simple guide for how to bring the practice of Kundalini Yoga into
            the practice of art. When you conscientiously call your spirit into
            the service of your art it brings deep fulfillment and joy". -Snatam
            Kaur

            "Unroll your yoga mat, open your sketchbook, and allow your innate
            creativity to flourish, guided by this irresistible, inspiring book.
            Internationally renowned artist and yoga teacher Hari Kirin Kaur
            Khalsa draws on a lifetime's worth of hands-on experience in the art
            studio, and her many years as a student of Yogi Bhajan, to create a
            fully integrated practice of art and yoga that is accessible to
            newcomers and seasoned practitioners alike. Through the integration
            of movement and meditative awareness, heart-opening yoga practices,
            and joyfully creative art exercises, we are reminded of the beauty
            of self-expression and the interdependence of all things. As Hari
            Kirin so generously demonstrates, Art &amp; Yoga has the power to
            heal the mind, the spirit, and the body; it may even begin to heal
            the world. -Katrina Kenison, author of The Gift of an Ordinary Day
          </p>

          <p>
            "So many within the art and healing community long for a book
            integrating the traditions of yoga, contemplative practice, and
            creative expression, that longing is realized here with clarity,
            precision, and visual elegance. Art &amp; Yoga inspires and invites
            participation and discovery; it is an exercise of the embodied
            intelligence and imagination carried by the deep streams of the
            respective traditions and renewed through their partnership which
            Hari Kirin has embraced as her life's work". -Shaun McNiff, Lesley
