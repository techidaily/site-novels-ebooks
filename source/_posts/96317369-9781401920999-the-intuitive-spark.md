          <b
            >As a parent, you set the tone for your children's intuitive
            awakening.&nbsp;A spiritually conscious and integrated dad or mom
            who has a strong connection to his or her own inner guidance and
            well-being makes it possible for that same quality to flourish in
            kids and at home.<br /></b
          ><br />
          Over the years, Sonia Choquette has been asked whether her
          extraordinary intuition is a gift, and she's come to answer "yes". But
          her blessing wasn’t being endowed with an “extra sense.” It was having
          a mother who created a spiritual awareness and a home environment that
          encouraged all of her senses to develop.<br /><br />
          That is what inspired Sonia Choquette to write this profound and
          accessible book explaining—through spiritual principles, modern-day
          parables, and practical exercises—how even busy parents can help
          children connect to their own source of Divine guidance.<br /><br />
          Your personal sixth sense is activated by training your awareness to
          become sharper and receive more information from others, the astral
          planes, your Higher Self, and God. You begin this process by learning
          how to expand your consciousness and better understand the way your
          body takes in and responds to energy. Intuitive living is the art of
          developing your awareness to be a highly sophisticated receiver of
          vibrations that will give you more accurate data to work with as you
          interact with people. It involves teaching yourself to be open and
          receptive to the subtle planes of energy that constitute our psychic
          lives.<br /><br />
          Awakening your sixth sense begins with an awareness of ten basic
          principles:<br />
          Intuition and other creative six-sensory abilities are gifts of the
          Divine Source within everyone.We’re all spiritual beings; therefore,
          we’re all six-sensory by nature and can even be psychic.Developing our
          innate wisdom is our spiritual birthright.Intuitive insights are
          messages from a Divine source that lead us to our own sacred essence
          and our highest creative abilities.Spirit-based direction benefits all
          people.Inner guidance is activated by love and results in greater
          understanding and compassion for ourselves and others.A six-sensory
          life is gentle, powerful, courageous, and always noncoercive.The Inner
          Teacher doesn’t flatter the ego; rather, it supports our spirit’s
          expression and growth.An intuitive life releases our full
          potential!Being attuned to our sixth sense ourselves is the best way
          to nurture this important ability in our children. As Sonia says,
          "Connecting to our intuition unites us with both our soul and the soul
          of the Universe, Divine Spirit. It takes away our fearful sense of
          isolation and inadequacy. It replaces fear with a sense of spiritual
          direction and safety. The world becomes friendly, nonadversarial, and
          welcoming. Life becomes joyful, amusing, generous, and abundant. This
          is the Divine plan. The intuitive life is one of confidence, inner
          peace, and creative expression. What better gift to give ourselves and
          our children?"

          “Intuition in a child is precious. [This book] beautifully underscores
          the value of intuition as a creative contributor to a child’s growth
          and self-esteem. Children who are fortunate enough to grow up trusting
          their intuition will be more confident adults with inner peace.”<br /><b
