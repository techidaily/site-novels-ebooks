              world</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The modern Western world has often raised its eyebrows at magic,
            associating it with madness and superstition. However, this ignores
            the fact of the matter that magic is a universal human experience
            which has existed in a multitude of forms across time and space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, in his groundbreaking book, Ari Freeman presents his argument
            that magic is still a human universal - we’ve just forgotten how to
            talk about it!
          </p>
          <p>
            Laying out clear and concise arguments, Pragmatic Magical Thinking
            will enlighten readers to how magic can be a practical approach to
            achieving real world results, drawing on evidence from science,
            philosophy, history and anthropology.
          </p>
          <p>
            For both beginners at magic, and the long practicing witch or
            wizard, Ari Freeman’s book is a breath of fresh air for the world of
            magical studies, inviting readers to join him in placing magic in
            it’s rightful place as a serious and mainstream subject of
            conversation and enquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pragmatic Magical Thinking covers a wide and comprehensive selection
            of subjects in relation to your magical education. These include,
            but are not limited to: magic and memory, spirits, belief, magic in
            everyday life, science and magic, religion and magic, Kabbalist
            cosmology and morality.

          “This intriguing book sets out to launch a conversation about how much
          of traditional occultism can be understood from within a
          philosophically literate modern worldview. Thoughtful and refreshingly
          open-minded, it’s worth a close reading from occultists and
          rationalists alike.”<br /><strong>John Michael Greer</strong>, author
          of The Occult Philosophy Workbook
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />“Ari Freeman has turned the tables. Pragmatic Magical Thinking
          has taken typical arguments and assumptions used to discredit magic,
          and used them to justify, explain and actually celebrate magical
          thinking.”<br /><strong>Ramsey Dukes</strong>, author of The Little
          Book of Demons and How to See Fairies
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />“Using tools from science, philosophy, history, and
          anthropology, Ari Freeman writes on magic from a twenty-first century
          perspective. He debunks the scientific reductionist view of the world,
          he believes, and I agree, changing your mind, really can change your
          reality. Freeman makes his arguments elegantly in this deep, but
          accessible book. Recommended.”<br /><strong>Elisabeth Brooke</strong>,
          author of Goddess Astrology and A Woman’s Book of Shadows

        <p></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Ari Freeman</strong> is a writer, fortune teller, public
          wizard and autodidact. He has over twenty years of experience as a
          performing professional musician, and spent seven years as the
          apprentice to the Wizard of New Zealand, which involved discussing
          philosophy, politics and magic out on the streets with an enthusiastic

          art, science, religion, modern society, as well as the occult and
          indigenous cultures. His goal is to bridge the gap between magical
          practitioners and skeptics, towards a world where we can all talk to
          each other. Ari lives in Christchurch, New Zealand.&nbsp;
