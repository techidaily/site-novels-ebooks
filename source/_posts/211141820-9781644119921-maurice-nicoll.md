          • Traces the life of Maurice Nicoll, who left a successful career as a
          psychiatrist in 1922 to study with G.I. Gurdjieff and P.D.
          Ouspensky<br /><br />• Explores newly uncovered diaries from Nicoll,
          revealing his mystical sex practices, his shadow self, and new
          understandings of his unorthodox teachings<br /><br />• Examines the
          influence of psychiatrist Carl Jung and Swedish scientist and
          philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg on Nicoll’s work<br /><br />In 1922,
          Maurice Nicoll (1884-1953) abandoned his successful London psychiatry
          practice and his direct studies with Carl Jung to move his family just
          outside of Paris to the Institute for the Harmonious Development of
          Man, a center recently opened by philosopher, mystic, and spiritual
          guru G. I. Gurdjieff, the founder of the esoteric system that became
          known as the “Fourth Way.” Nicoll went on to become one of the most
          passionate teachers of the Fourth Way, committing the final three
          decades of his life to teaching “The Work” in his own unorthodox
          style.<br /><br />In this revealing biography, Gary Lachman draws on
          recently uncovered diaries to explore the unusual, syncretic approach
          Nicoll brought to his teaching of the Fourth Way. He shows how Nicoll
          is unique in having Jung, Gurdjieff, and Ouspensky as teachers and to
          have known each of these important figures in esoteric history
          personally, yet—as Lachman reveals—Nicoll was not a blind devotee by
          any stretch. Lachman shows how Nicoll incorporated elements of Jungian
          psychology and Emanuel Swedenborg-inspired mysticism into his
          exploration and teaching of both Gurdjieff’s and Ouspensky’s ideas, as
          well as into his own best-known work,
          <i
            >Psychological Commentaries on the Teaching of Gurdjieff and
            Ouspensky.</i
          ><br /><br />Lachman reveals the unorthodox side of Nicoll in fuller
          detail than ever before through excerpts from recently shared diaries,
          in which Nicoll included detailed accounts of his own solitary
          “self-sex” erotic experimentations to reach visionary states, along
          with recordings of his dreams and other personal and mystical
          reflections. The social details of Nicoll’s life are also examined,
          including vivid portraits of the occult scene in the
          early-to-mid-twentieth century and the communal living situations in
          which Nicoll sometimes resided. Drawing on his familiarity with
          hermetic practices and his own experiences with “The Work,” Lachman
          comprehensively explores the significance of Nicoll and the novelty of
          his thought, offering a profound, needed, and sympathetic but critical
          study of this man so instrumental to the development and legacy of the
          Fourth Way.
