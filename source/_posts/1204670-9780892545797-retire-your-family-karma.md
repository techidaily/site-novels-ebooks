          We reap what we sow, but we also reap what others before us have sown.
          If we do this unconsciously, we find ourselves victims of unfortunate
          circumstances, but if we are conscious of what we have taken on from
          our family legacy, we can turn it around.<br /><br />Doctors Bedi and
          Matthews have worked with people who have carried the burden of their
          families' best achievements, worst failures, and unrealized dreams.
          With their experience, we learn to recognize our karmic inheritance
          and settle our family's karmic accounts so we can redirect our
          energies in accord with our own true path and passion, our soul's
          calling. Bedi and Matthews explain how ancestral karma gets
          energetically encoded in the chakras of our subtle body and manifests
          as chakra blockages or overactivity. They provide case histories from
          their patients, an analysis of the Kennedy family history, as well as
          the archetypal example of the history of the House of Atreus--the
          Greek legacy of family betrayal stemming from Tantalus to Atreus and
          Thyestes, to Agamemnon and finally, Orestes. In addition to these
          examples and illuminating case studies, the authors teach us how to
          use dreamwork, journaling, and diagramming our family tree as tools
          for identifying and overcoming inherited karma.<br /><br />To totally
          comprehend our roots and to realize our destiny, we must look beyond
          our individual life and understand our ancestral context in order to
          make sense of our journey. Once we have identified the blessings and
          the curses we have inherited, we have the possibility of choice. The
          best way to break old patterns is to work on establishing new ones.
