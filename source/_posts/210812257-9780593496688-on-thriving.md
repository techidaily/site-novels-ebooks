            >A renowned doula shares powerful lessons on healing and thriving

            deeper self-awareness and radical joy.</b

            >“This book is a beacon of resilience. . . . A must-read for anyone
            committed to growth.”—Erica Chidi Cohen, author of <i>Nurture</i></b
          ><br /><br />We’ve all been there: We take a pause, look at our lives,
          and desire more—more from our relationships, more from our wellness
          journeys, maybe simply more from ourselves. For some, it might be more
          fun, more peace, more exploration—but what does it take to get to the
          other side of living in survival mode? In <i>On Thriving,</i> Brandi
          Sellerz-Jackson helps us wade through what she calls the four great
          labors of our lives—labors that she’s had to overcome and that she has
          led many clients through.<br /><br />
          Drawing from her experiences as a doula and intimate storytelling from
          her own life, Sellerz-Jackson guides us through the many phases of
          these great labors—labors that we can get stuck in, stunting our
          ability to thrive. Across age, gender, economic status, or background,
          we all move through the great labor of our relationships, our mental
          health, grief and loss, and the feeling of being othered.
          Sellerz-Jackson doesn’t shy away from the pitfalls of these labors but
          rather challenges us to actively remain present within them and ask
          ourselves: What do I need to thrive in the space I’m currently in? In
          <i>On Thriving,</i> you’ll come to recognize the survival tools you’ve
          picked up along the way and exchange them for thriving tools and
          “rich-uals.” You’ll commit to no longer making a home out of chaos and
          rediscovering sanctuary within yourself.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          Comparing our thriving to that of plant life, Sellerz-Jackson
          simplifies the complicated—and oftentimes overwhelming—journey as we
          attempt to grow in an inhospitable environment. With insightful and
          vulnerable storytelling, she invites a deep, soul-stirring
          investigation of our past and present to gather all that we need to
          thrive right where we are, right now.

          ><br /><br />“Brandi’s book is more of&nbsp;an invitation&nbsp;than
          homework. She encourages us to embrace the darkness as well as the
          light. Both can be our companion.&nbsp;Brandi is the ideal guide to
          usher you across the threshold of a new kind of
          self-discovery.&nbsp;Her mission is for people to stop going through
          the motions and to, finally, start savoring their lives.”<b

            producer</b
          ><br /><br />“An honest, kind, and powerful book to get one’s life
          back on track.&nbsp;Brandi reminds us that thriving is not something
          that we ‘achieve’ after we do the work. Rather it’s something we can
          experience during all seasons of life, no matter where we are on our
          healing journey.”<b
