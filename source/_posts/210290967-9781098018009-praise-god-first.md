            When do you praise God? When He has done something grand? How about
            when He's done something you don't understand or agree with? Are you
            praising God for being a Giver and a Taker? It is important to
            recognize God's attributes that please us, as well as the ones that
            don't, then offer up praise to Him for all things and in all
            circumstances.Often, praise is completely left out of our prayers to
            God. If we follow the example Jesus gave in Matthew 6:9-13, then
            praise should come first, yet finding the words to do this can be
            challenging. This book contains over five hundred praise words to
            help facilitate a more intimate knowledge of God, broadening our
            ability to praise Him specifically for His attributes. This book is
            a powerful transforming tool to be used in a daily walk with the
            Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Choose a word, then offer up a first
            fruit sacrifice of praise to God. If it is heartfelt and sincere,
            God will be pleased. You will be blessed because of the intimacy
            this creates.When we are praising, we are not controlling, we are
            releasing. Praise prayer is different because it removes the
            tendency to give orders to God that sounds something like, "please
            fix this," "change that," "don't do this," "give me that." Sometimes
            a defeated tone is present in our prayers, sounding like, "God, this
            is what I want, but your will be done, which is probably not my
            will, so I'm not sure how to pray." Praising God first can take away
            the need to control and the feeling of defeat by releasing it to
            God, focusing entirely on Him and His sovereignty in all
            circumstances.Praise God first. That's what we can do. God has got
            the rest.Through Him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice
            of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that give thanks to His
            name. (Heb. 13:15)
