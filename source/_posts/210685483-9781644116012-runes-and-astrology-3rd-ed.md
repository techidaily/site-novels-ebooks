          <b>Explores how runes relate to the cycles of time</b><br /><br />•
          Looks at the meanings and temporal qualities of the 24 runes of the
          Elder Futhark and their rapport with ancient timekeeping and
          star-reading methods<br /><br />• Examines the runes’ relationships
          with the planets, the stars, the seasons, and the precessional year<br /><br />•
          Provides charts and calculations to discern which rune is the primary
          influence on a particular day, week, month, season, or year, as well
          as methods for calculating runic birth charts and runic horoscopes<br /><br />Detailing
          the significance of natural time cycles in the Northern Tradition,
          Nigel Pennick explores how the stars, planets, seasons, months, and
          the precessional year relate to the runes.<br /><br />The author
          explains how the runes are more than just an ancient European
          alphabet—they encapsulate particular spiritual and symbolic meanings
          to individually and collectively express deep eternal truths.
          Discussing the pagan wheel of the year, whose eightfold path later
          served the Church as the basis for the eight holy celebrations of its
          religious calendar, he looks at the meanings and temporal qualities of
          the 24 runes of the Elder Futhark and their rapport with ancient
          timekeeping and star-reading methods. He offers charts and
          calculations to discern which rune is the primary influence on a
          particular day, week, month, season, or year. He also examines runic
          elemental and color associations and their esoteric spatial roles,
          where they represent the four directions, the eight airts, and other
          cycles critical to understanding the sacred nature of the material
          world. <br /><br />Exploring runic astrology, Pennick looks at the
          runes as they relate to the planets and their cycles. He then presents
          ways to use this knowledge for calculating runic birth charts and
          runic horoscopes. Revealing the importance of the patterns and cycles
          of time operating in our world, the author provides a means for
          reconnecting with these primal principles—which underlie our existence
          as beings in time—through the ancient wisdom of runes.

          perhaps the most relatable and accessible way—through an intimate
          relationship with time and place. His gift of making the personal
          transform into mythic through the power of the runes shines.”
