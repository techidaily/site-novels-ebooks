            >An in-depth examination of how astrology is a form of systems
            science</b
          ><br /><br />• Shares modern biological studies offering evidence that
          our solar system neighbors profoundly affect and shape life on our
          planet<br /><br />
          • Explores the early practice of astrometeorology, revealing the links
          between the solar system, weather, and climate over large spans of
          time<br /><br />
          • Looks at the history, philosophy, and methodologies of astrology, as
          well as its potential future applications in medicine and the social
          sciences<br /><br />
          Our ancient ancestors recorded the rhythms of the Sun, Moon, planets,
          and stars, correlating these rhythms with weather, plant growth, and
          animal and human behaviors. From these early geocosmic recordings were
          born calendars, astronomy, and astrology. While astrology is now
          mostly viewed as subjective fortune-telling, Bruce Scofield argues
          that astrology is not only a practice but also a science, specifically
          a form of systems science--a set of techniques for mapping and
          analyzing self-organizing systems.<br /><br />
          Providing clear evidence that our solar system neighbors profoundly
          affect and shape life on our planet, Scofield shares modern biological
          and climatological studies on the effects of Earth’s rotation, the
          Sun, the Moon, and the rhythms of light, gravity, magnetism, and solar
          radiation on terrestrial processes. He explores the early practice of
          astrometeorology, a method of weather forecasting used from ancient
          times into the Renaissance, revealing the links between the solar
          system, weather, and climate over large spans of time. He shares his
          own studies on the correlations between Saturn’s position and
          terrestrial weather as well as presenting a wealth of evidence on
          astrological effects and the theories and mechanics behind them.<br /><br />
          Examining the history of astrology, he looks at its earliest
          foundations in Mesopotamia and its development by the classical Greeks
          into a mathematically informed body of knowledge. He explores the
          decline and marginalization of astrology during the Scientific
          Revolution of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, when astrology
          was transformed from a credible science to a controversial practice
          after being attacked by the Church and then abandoned by experimental
          scientists.<br /><br />
          Presenting a broad look at how the cosmic environment shapes nature,
          the author shows how the practice and natural science of astrology can
          expand its applications in modern society in such varied fields as
          medicine, history, and sociology.

          “This is an incredible work! Others have written histories of
          astrology, but none of them have been histories of astrology as well
          as comprehensive discussions of the sociology of astrology throughout
          its history. This is not only a superb piece of intellectual history
          but also an eloquent discussion of where astrology is today and how it
          has gotten here. In particular Scofield has not only explained and
          defended astrology on philosophical as well as on other grounds, but
          in the course of doing so, he has also written a brilliant critique of
          what he calls the reductionist-mechanistic- materialist (RMM) view,
          which monolithically dominates modern science to the degree that any
          corpus of ideas that requires one to see outside of its influence is
          almost impossible to see. I believe he has given a brilliant critique
          of the RMM that is useful for any student of modern civilization, not
          just astrologers. This book I would say is his magnum opus.”
