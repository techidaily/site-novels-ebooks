          On the one hand, we have traditional science, based on the premises of
          materialism, reductionism, and randomness, with a belief that reality
          consists solely of matter and energy, that everything can be measured
          in the laboratory or observed by a telescope. If it can't, it doesn't
          exist. On the other hand, we have traditional religious dogma
          concerning God that fails to take into account evolution, a 4.6
          billion-year-old Earth, and the conflicting claims of the world's
          religions. In The God Theory, Bernard Haisch discards both these
          worldviews and proposes a theory that provides purpose for our lives
          while at the same time is completely consistent with everything we
          have discovered about the universe and life on Earth. To wit, Newton
          was right -- there is a God -- and wrong -- this is not merely a
          material world. Haisch proposes that science will explain God and God
          will explain science. Consciousness is not a mere epiphenomenon of the
          brain; it is our connection to God, the source of all consciousness.
          Ultimately it is consciousness that creates matter and not vice versa.
          New discoveries in physics point to a background sea of quantum light
          underlying the universe. The God Theory offers a worldview that
          incorporates cutting-edge science and ancient mystical knowledge. This
          is nothing less than a revolution in our understanding.

        <p>
          Bernard Haisch, PhD is an astrophysicist, author of over 130
          scientific publications, and was a scientific editor of the
          Astrophysical Journal for ten years. After earning his PhD from the
          University of Wisconsin in Madison, Haisch did postdoctoral research
          at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics, University of
          Colorado, Boulder and the University of Utrecht, the Netherlands. His
          professional positions include staff scientist at the Lockheed Martin
          Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory, deputy director of the Center for
          Extreme Ultraviolet Astrophysics at the University of California,
          Berkeley, and visiting scientist at the Max-Planck-Institute für
          Extraterrestrische Physik in Garching, Germany. He was also
          editor-in-chief of the Journal of Scientific Exploration. Prior to his
          career in astrophysics, Haisch attended the Latin School of
          Indianapolis and the St. Meinrad Seminary as a student for the
          Catholic priesthood. The God Theory is his first solo book. He is
          married with three children and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area
          with his wife, Marsha Sims.
