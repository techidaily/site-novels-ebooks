            Fire Dragon Meridian Qigong is a traditional Chinese internal
            alchemy method that embodies the spirit of the rising dragon, an
            auspicious symbol of transformation in Chinese culture. The form
            works directly on the acupuncture meridians, releasing areas of
            stagnation and bringing the physical and emotional body into a
            balanced state of well-being.<br /><br />This Qigong form implements
            special visualization and breathing techniques in addition to
            movements that imitate sparks arising from a bonfire and swirling
            upward like a spiraling dragon. Stoking our 'inner fire' melts away
            the 'ice', or the areas of blockage and disease,&nbsp;opens our
            energetic pathways and allows the smooth flow of Qi in our
            meridians.&nbsp;The Fire Dragon practice follows the traditional
            internal alchemy process, where&nbsp;Jing&nbsp;(essence) transforms
            to Qi (vital energy), Qi transforms to Shen (spirit),
            and&nbsp;Shen&nbsp;returns to Emptiness. Fire Dragon Meridian Qigong
            is a key Qigong form for those seeking healing from cancer and other
            significant health challenges, and is the practice the authors
            turned to in order to transform the grief over their son's death.<br /><br />The
            book provides background information and a detailed description of
            the form itself, illustrated with calligraphy, meridian drawings,
            and photographs throughout.

          “Teachers teach what they know. We need them. Masters rarely teach,
          but when they do, they teach what they are. Tigers do not hand out
          resumes but they are masters of being tigers. The modern world has
          become a discourteous complication drowning in an unnatural,
          unconnected soup of over-information, bereft of wisdom and any sane
          direction. For our bodies, minds, and souls to survive this worldwide
          cultural disaster, we need the delicious complexity of our real
          indigenous natures to reappear. We are lucky to have Master Wu's
          generous approach as a place to begin becoming natural humans again.”
