            Let us be aware that human existence is not real. If it truly were
            reality, then the physical body would not perish; there would then
            be lasting youth.&nbsp;The soul in a person is not of this world, it
            lives eternally-we are therefore nothing more than wayfarers on the
            way back to the true eternal homeland. However, to which influences
            a person is exposed to on his way on this side of life and as a soul
            in the beyond is reported about in this book- as a warning and
            guidance. Those people who believe in a higher existence, which we
            call Creator or God, should be aware that this side of life and the
            beyond are not separate-and that our behavior on this side has an
            effect on our further life's path as a soul.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>A selected passage from the book:</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            "Every person has a spiritual guardian being at his or her side,
            which, according to free will, admonishes and warns. But whether the
            person perceives the impulses or disregards them is determined by
            the person himself. Life on Earth is dangerous, and yet, each person
            has his own path of becoming in hand ..."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>An excerpt:</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            "... Perhaps these words can help many a one to think about himself.
            The request to you, to all of us is: Pay attention, may we all pay
            attention to the content of everything that we utter and what we
            want and do. We transfer everything, but really everything to our
            soul. ...
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Do not allow yourself, let us not allow ourselves, to be tempted and
            seduced! Let us take good care of our body and of our soul; for, as
            mentioned, just as we are as a human being, we could perhaps be as a
            soul already tomorrow. For none of knows when his last hour will
            be."&nbsp;&nbsp;
