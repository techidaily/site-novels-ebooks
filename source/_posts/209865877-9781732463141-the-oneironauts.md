              >Have you ever had a strong feeling of deja vu or witnessed that a
              dream came true in the future?</strong
            >
            Are such experiences precognitive or just illusions of the mind?
            &nbsp;How would a top scientist approach such questions about the
            paranormal? &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The Oneironauts, or "the dream travelers," introduces new scientific
            evidence that we really do experience possible future events in our
            dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Author Paul Kalas is the University of California,&nbsp;Berkeley
            astronomer who captured the first picture of a planet orbiting the
            nearby star Fomalhaut using the Hubble Space Telescope. &nbsp;This
            image appeared on the front page of the New York Times and is
            displayed in the National Air and Space Museum. &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In The Oneironauts he reveals for the first time that this
            pioneering discovery was recorded in his dream diary nine years
            before it was actually discovered. &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In Chapters 1-3, Dr. Kalas relates how prophetic dreams allowed him
            to both avoid an unpleasant event and affirm a desired goal.
            &nbsp;He concludes that fate is an illusion, the future can be
            changed, and both our gut instincts and sense of hope arise from
            precognitive dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapters 4 presents the famous astronomical discovery and
            precognitive dream in detail, while Chapter 5 analyzes a total of
            332 precognitive experiences. &nbsp;Dr. Kalas interprets
            precognition as a phenomenon related to memory and learning that
            also influences our personal identity and life path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kalas reviews modern concepts of space and time in Chapters 6
            and 7. &nbsp;From physics and astronomy he introduces the reader to
            relativity, gravitational lensing, the particle-wave duality of
            light, quantum entanglement, and biophysics. &nbsp;From neuroscience
            he explains key breakthroughs in our understanding of memory and the
            perception of spacetime through the study of the hippocampus, sleep
            and theta rhythm.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Chapter 8, Dr. Kalas engages the reader with his vision of how
            precognitive dreaming can improve the lives of individuals and
            ultimately the future of humanity. &nbsp;What will our society look
            like in 1,000 years when humans and artificial intelligence have
            developed reliable methods to recover information from the future?
          </p>
          <p>
            The Oneironauts will dazzle anyone who has had a precognitive
            experience or simply wishes to read what a leading scientist
            predicts about the future. &nbsp;It is beautifully illustrated with
            34 original figures and clearly explains modern scientific topics
            with a touch of humor and references to over 100 writers, poets,
            artists and scholars.&nbsp;

          "The Oneironauts is especially valuable in that it provides his data
          consisting in a longitudinal study of how déjà experiences can develop
          as one ages. Additionally, it manages to be an amazing romp! Wow! I
          thoroughly enjoyed all the speculation and the visions of possible
          futures. This book expands the mind and broadens horizons. I recommend
          it unreservedly."

          "So I’m back with an exciting book review. I just came across this
          today and it deals with déjà vu. If you’ve ever had déjà vu, when you
          link that familiarity to a memory you have from a past dream you’ve
          had days, weeks, months or years, this book covers that explicitly in
          great detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          What’s so exciting is here you have Paul Kalas who has written The
          Oneironauts and it is an outstanding approach to this phenomenon. Now,
          if you’ve had this experience, I highly recommend this book. His
          approach looks at it from a scientific perspective. I have always
          appreciated people who are academic and have this experience and then
          write about it, and I’m always impressed because I find so many common
          themes in their writing. The last time I came across a book that takes
          a person’s personal experience and writes about it scientifically is
          J.W. Dunne’s “An Experiment with Time” which was published back in
          1927."
        </p>
        <p>
          It [déjà vu] is not uncommon. In fact frequency studies done by Dr.
          Art Funkhouser and many other scientists that have investigated this
          show a really high percentage of people have this experience. So I
          think it’s really healthy to open up about it and Paul’s book is
          fantastic."

        <p>
          This book is groundbreaking in a parallel fashion to The Tao of
          Physics, which back in 1975 converged the worlds of mysticism and
          modern physics. Kalas, an active and accomplished astronomer, delves
          into his personal experiences with dreams of the future, and explores
          the possible scientific and biological mechanisms for this phenomena.
          Those who have memories of dreams of future experiences he denotes as
          Oneironauts, and he is one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final chapter, Kalas examines the practical aspects of the
          oneironaut phenomena. He gives practical advice for those interested
          in building their dream recall; outlines how groups of people—even
          whole societies—can build a “Dreamnet” using a giant database akin to
          big data and use it to determine future events; and he examines the
          huge moral and legal implications should the prediction—or
          rewriting—of future events become commonplace. Have you seen the movie
          Minority Report about a future where people are arrested for crimes
          they have contemplated but haven’t yet committed? This chapter is
          Minority Report on steroids.
