            >A celebration and practical guide to the renowned and beloved
            goddess and orisha.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Yemaya, queen of the sea, first emerged in Yorubaland (now in modern
          Nigeria). A primordial deity, considered the mother of all, some
          perceive her to be at the root of numerous ancient goddesses,
          including Isis. During the Middle Passage, Yemaya accompanied her
          enslaved devotees to the Western Hemisphere, where her veneration took
          root and flourished. She is among the most beloved and prominent
          spirits of Candomblé, Santeria, and other African diaspora
          traditions.<br /><br />
          Through her associations with the Virgin Mary, devotion to Yemaya
          spread throughout Latin America. Cuban immigrants brought Yemaya with
          them to the US, where her veneration expanded exponentially. No longer
          a local water spirit, she became an internationally beloved goddess
          whose devotees derive from numerous traditions and who worship her in
          her many fluid forms. Yemaya currently ranks among the most beloved
          goddesses worldwide.<br /><br />
          Raven Morgaine, a priest of Yemaya for over three decades, shares his
          expertise and knowledge in
          <b><i>Yemaya: Orisha, Goddess, and Queen of the Sea</i></b
          >, the first full-length English language book accessible to general
          readers. Morgaine explores Yemaya’s history and her many forms,
          including her roles as mother, lover, witch, warrior, and mermaid. He
          describes her many paths, aspects, and incarnations. Simultaneously a
          celebration of Yemaya and a practical, hands-on guide to working with
          her, <b><i>Yemaya</i></b> explores her mythology in depth, as well as
          her special role in the LGBQT community.<br /><br />
          The book features: Spells and rituals associated with Yemaya
          appropriate for the uninitiatedInstructions for building altars and
          shrines for Yemaya, as well as other methods for working with her,
          including correct, respectful ways to make appropriate
