            Meditation is an ancient practice that has brought peace and clarity
            to people from every time, culture, and place. Its benefits —a sense
            of calm, greater knowledge of self, better health—are as appealing
            to the modern world as they were to the ancient. In this beginner’s
            guide to meditation, author Patrick Harbula provides readers with
            everything they need to know in order to experience deep meditation.
            <br /><br />
            Readers will learn: <br />
            - The history of meditation, both Eastern and Western<br />
            - The benefits of meditation for the mind, body, and spirit<br />
            - Different forms of meditation practice<br />- Supportive practices
            to enhance the benefits of meditation in daily living.<br />
            - Simple ways to begin meditation immediately, and more...<br /><br />
            In addition, readers will also find simple techniques to deepen the
            meditation path for more experienced meditators.
            <i>Meditation</i> demystifies the often times intimidating world of
            meditation, providing the perfect starting point for anyone looking
            to cultivate a sense of peace in their life.<br /><br /><b

          "Encyclopedic in scope, this useful compendium is not just for
          newcomers on the spiritual path. Author Patrick Harbula covers every
          aspect of meditation from its history to its benefits to the how-tos
          of more than two dozen practices. A lifetime of experience with
          Eastern and Western contemplative traditions informs these pages,
          packed with useful tips on choosing a method, what to expect, and
          establishing a daily practice. Meditation fundamentals like
          breathwork, mindfulness, and visualization are explained in clear,
          accessible terms." —Joan Duncan Oliver, author of
          <i
            >Buddhism: An Introduction to the Buddha's Life, Teachings, and
            Practices</i
          >. <br /><br /><br />"Meditation is a very simple process which can be
          done in many ways. Patrick Harbula provides a guide which can be read
          as a basic primer or as a deep dive into all things meditation. This
          is a book that should be on every meditator's bookshelf and be
          dogeared, marked up, and well-read." —Dr. Jim Lockard, author of

            Leadership<br /></i
          ><br /><br />In <i>Meditation </i>Patrick Harbula offers perhaps the
          most inclusive explanation and application of meditation I have ever
          read. He has taken what is generally perceived as an Eastern practice
          and made it “user-friendly” for the western mind. This is an exquisite
          and transparent handbook for anyone who seeks to explore the countless
          benefits found in a life grounded in meditation. I encourage you to
          allow Patrick to be your personal guide on the journey to the place
          you never really left—your oneness with Life. He knows—in real
          time—from whence he speaks.<br />—Dr. Dennis Merritt Jones,
          bestselling author of,
          <i>The Art of Abundance :Ten rules for a Prosperous Life</i>, and<i>

            It <br /><br /></i
          >"Patrick Harbula’s presentation of a wide variety of meditation
          styles and techniques makes this book a unique presentation on the
          subject. Particularly insightful is the Helpful Hints section, which
          offers practical and cutting edge strategies for effortlessly stilling
          the mind. The Chapter on Supportive Spiritual Practices also makes
          this book a seminal and complete treatment for spiritual growth as
          well as user friendly tool for beginners and seasoned meditators
          alike." —Dr. Ken Gordon, Spiritual Director of Centers for Spiritual
          Living<br /><br />"Patrick Harbula has created a beautiful
          introduction to the novice meditator. Using gentle humor, personal
          stories, and practical suggestions, he guides the reader through
          complex ideas such as enlightenment, spiritual bypass, dealing with
          expectations, and sustaining an enjoyable and meaningful meditation
          practice."<br />

            >The Power of Meditation: An Ancient Technique to Access Your Inner
            Power<br /><br /></i
          ><br />"While explaining the deep, historical roots of meditation,
          Patrick makes the practice very accessible to the beginner and highly
          motivational for the long-time meditator. This is one of the most
          comprehensive books on Meditation available to us today. Benefits,
          approaches, and specific practices are skillfully explained in his
          approachable, personal style, and I recommend it wholeheartedly."

          >"The verdict is in! Meditation is found to reduce stress and pain
          while boosting cognitive and immune function. So, why isn’t
          <i>everyone</i> doing it? Patrick Harbula to the rescue! He has taken
          this lofty and sometimes confusing topic and distilled it down to
          beautiful essence. Not only does he share the history and benefits of
          meditation, but several powerful practices to get you into deeper
          touch with yourself. This book helps you experience the nourishing
          stillness and peace we all crave. If you’ve tried in the past and just
          couldn’t make meditation a part of your life, read this book. It is an
          essential guide filled with clear, gentle instruction and a whole lot
          of heart." —Kris Ferraro, Energy Coach, Speaker, and Author of
