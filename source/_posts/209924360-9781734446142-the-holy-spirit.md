              >America’s liberal youth is captivated by the Spiritualist
              phenomenon sweeping the country during the prohibition era of
              1923. Tipping tables, levitating chairs and rapps on walls raise
              national attention.</strong

            <strong
              >At the height of the movement are the most prominent mediums and
              channelers the United States has ever come to witness. Edgar
              Cayce, Helena Blavatsky and Three Spanish Dames are at the center
              of announcement, but another player lies at the end of the field.
              An investigator who has gained notoriety in New Orleans for
              debunking mediums and the myths that surround speaking with the
              dead.</strong

              >With large waves of immigrants coming from across the Atlantic,
              New York is flooded with witchery and fortune tellers that don’t
              uphold the standard Christian practice. At the discretion of High
              Pastor Baptiste, Senator Hypolite of Louisiana is asked to
              dispatch one of its locals, Pierre Monye, back to New York and
              expose the fraudulence.</strong

          <p>
            <strong
              >Monye heads forth on a mission to eradicate the imposers. His
              narcissistic behavior and alcohol addiction cause him to act
              irrationally. His colleague Tennessee, does his best to keep him
              in order, but things tend to get out of line in a moment’s notice
              when they step into the building.</strong

              >While in New York, Monye encounters the highly regarded Gwenevere
              Baptiste. Who finds herself at odds and in constant dispute with
              her father the High Pastor. The Pastor strongly opposes the
              radical views of the Spiritualist movement and preaches against it
              during gospel. However, constantly challenged by his rebellious
              daughters’ uncompromising belief to speak against him, without
              knowledge of her secretly practicing Mediumship.</strong

              >The mysterious investigator sidetracks the investigation when he
              falls infatuated with Gwenevere and his internal demons are cast
              aside by a growing affection and respect for the woman. At the
              heart of his dismay, Gwenevere takes a chance on him. Risking more
              damage to the credibility of the movement.</strong

              >The High Pastor grows more resentful when his daughter Gwenevere,
              publicly announces herself a Medium and leader of Spiritualism and
              speaks against his word. Infuriated, the High Pastor re-directs
              his anger on Monye, stating, “It’s time we lay down the very demon
              we set loose”.&nbsp;</strong

              stand with her or rip the very thing she stands for apart, all
              while risking his life to escape the city before the Fellowship
              finishes him off.</strong
