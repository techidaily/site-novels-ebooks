            Wilderness Therapy for Women offers women risktaking adventure
            activities in the outdoors as an alternative to traditional therapy.
            The contributing authors illustrate the empowerment, confidence, and
            self-esteem women can derive from adventure and experiential
            activities. This is the first book of its kind devoted to the
            symbolic value of wilderness accomplishments to women’s mental
            health. Wilderness Therapy for Women unites women with nature and
            each other by lifting the social constraints surrounding women in
            adventure pursuits. It offers women a new method of healing while
            developing an appreciation for the uniqueness of the environment.
            Daring experiences in the outdoors rekindles a sense of strength and
            a respect for the provider of that strength. A therapeutic
            experience from the outdoors provides women with an awareness of
            their capabilities to strengthen and preserve themselves and their
            surroundings. This book is divided into four parts: Theoretical
            Perspectives, Wilderness Therapy in Action, Special Populations, and
            Personal Narratives. Readers will find many topics of interest
            including:
          </p>
          Body image and wilderness therapy The therapeutic value of the
          wilderness Ethical considerations of experiential therapy Ropes
          courses for women All-women’s river trips Special populations: rape
          and incest survivors, welfare mothers, and mid-life women. Intended as
          a guide book, Wilderness Therapy for Women is ideal for mental health
          professionals who are either practicing wilderness therapy or merely
          inquisitive about it. Outfitters and professional outdoor leaders will
          benefit from chapters on theory, applications, and special
          populations. Outdoor program administrators and educators who must
          remain on the cutting edge of their industry will also profit from
          this book.
