          Immortal Longings: FWH Myers and the Victorian search for life after
          death is the first full-length biography of Frederic W.H. Myers,
          leading figure in the Society for Psychical Research and friend and
          associate of Browning, Gladstone, Ruskin, Tennyson, Swinburne, Henry
          James, Prince Leopold and other influential Victorians. The book
          offers a fascinating insight into a key period in the development of
          Victorian thought. Among many things it covers: 1. Extraordinary
          Phenomena Myers investigated extraordinary phenomena, much of which is
          still reported today: out of body experiences and astral projection,
          near death experiences, poltergeists, gurus like Madame Blavatsky
          claiming strange powers, mediums both private and public, and haunted
          houses (for example, the giant warrior haunting a chateau near
          Heidelberg, the Cheltenham Ghost that was seen by a considerable
          number of people, and the odd doings at Ballechin House in Scotland
          which caused a scandal in the press. 2. Life After Death
          Investigations Myers believed he had virtually proved life after death
          by a) the link he thought established between hundreds of apparitions
          and living or dead human beings b) the messages that the outstanding
          mediums Mrs Piper and Mrs Thompson gave him from his first great love
          Annie and his intimate friend and co-worker Edmund Gurney which
          contained information the medium could not know and was delivered in a
          way highly characteristic of the personality concerned. 3. Automatic
          Writing Some researchers have claimed that he has returned after death
          and proved his continued existence through the automatic writings of a
          number of mediums in England, America, India. These writings continued
          for thirty years. 4. Romance &amp; Suicide There is also love, tragedy
          and jealousy in Myers' life. His first great love Annie, a married
          woman, committed suicide and Myers' wife, a rather possessive person,
          tried to prevent any detail about this being made public after his
          death, even though the relationship was platonic. This inhibited the
          work of researchers who were trying to verify the 'post-mortem'
          communications from Myers, since, for many years, they could not check
          the facts. 5. Credibility Myers researches led him to forming a view
          about human personality and psychology which Aldous Huxley has said is
          much richer than Freud's.
