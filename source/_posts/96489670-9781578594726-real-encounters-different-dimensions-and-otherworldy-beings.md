          <br /><br />From mysterious strangers and unpredictable beings to
          weird behavior and paranormal phenomena, they investigate claims of
          visits from ghastly ghosts, otherworldly creatures, aliens living
          among us, phantoms, spirits and other accounts of encounters with the
          unexplained. Over 130 astounding accounts of

          with the supernatural such as:<br /><br />
          Visitors from other worlds who have had Earth under surveillance for
          centuries, conducting their activities in secret-even abducting humans
          for their own research and undeclared ends. Members of secret
          societies who developed advanced technology centuries ago which has
          been kept hidden in underground or undersea cities. Time Travelers
          from the Future. Beings who claim to be our descendants from the
          future who are returning to study the true destiny of humankind.
          Ghosts that haunt people, places, and things--and poltergeists that
          create havoc. Beasties and monsters found in everyone’s worst
          nightmares--and sometimes in their campsites, fields, and yards. Other
          Dimensional Visitors, Beings, Creatures, or Entities that come not
          from a faraway world in our solar system or any other, but from an
          adjacent space-time continuum existing on another
          vibrational/dimensional frequency or level. Previously unknown,
          unidentified terrestrial life-forms, such beings as ""sky-critters,""
          ""sky fish,” “rods,” and “orbs.” As yet unknown physical energies that
          may be activated by the psyche, the unconscious level of the
          humanmind. Archetypal creatures and entities of the collective
          unconscious that are the result of energies that are accessible
          through dreams, meditations, and other states of altered
          consciousness. Interactions with beings that have been dubbed elves,
          fairies, devas throughout the centuries. The marvelous, creative facet
          of dreams. Out-of-body mind-traveling through Time and Space. Majestic
          beings who are described in the scriptures of many world religions as
          angels or demons.

          something fascinating or terrifying. It belongs on your bookshelf."

          richer introduction into this twilight realm between the known worlds
          of establishment science and religion, the Steiger’s have certainly
          prepared an excellent assemblage of thought-provoking material for all
          of us to ponder and reflect upon much further. ... another
          comprehensive, thought-provoking masterpiece"
          <i>Alternate Perceptions</i><br /><br />"I am completely amazed on how
          many people love UFO lore, but are so misguided with the facts. I am
          so glad that there are researchers out there like Sherry and Brad ...
          This book transcends ignorance and misinformation ... Another standing
          ovation for the Steigers!" <i>Beforeitsnews.com</i><br /><br />"These
          two veteran researchers of a wide variety of paranormal experiences
          once more produce an encyclopædic volume, this time thematically on
          anomalous experiences of other worlds’ and entities’, from the
          expected aliens and fairies to demons, totem animals, angels, spirits,
          poltergeists, disembodied voices and the sense of divine presence. A
          good fortean read." <i>Fortean Times</i><br /><br />"This is a book
          that skillfully demonstrates the world we see around us does not
          amount to all that there is to see. There are domains and dimensions
          that are inhabited by supernatural intelligences that we do not fully
          understand, and forces and forms to be reckoned with.
          <i>Real Encounters, Different Dimensions, and Otherworldly Beings</i>
          opens those doors and unleashes those forces and forms upon us and
          then some!" <i>Mysterious Universe .org</i><br /><br />"<i

          >
          covers a lot of ground. If it falls under the labels of UFOs, Weird
          History, the Supernatural, Spiritualism, Conspiracy, you'll find it
          here. It's a no holds barred look at the unexplainable with people who
          do a good job of explaining it. This is one of the rare books that has
          something to offer both the reader new to the topic as well as a life
          long follower. Definitely worth a read, and this may be the book
          everyone wants to borrow. You have been warned." <i>HorrorTalk.com</i
