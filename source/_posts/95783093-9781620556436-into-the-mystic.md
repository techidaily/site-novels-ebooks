          Explores the visionary, mystical, and ecstatic traditions that
          influenced the music of the 1960s <br /><br />• Examines the
          visionary, spiritual, and mystical influences on the Grateful Dead,
          the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, the
          Incredible String Band, the Left Banke, Lou Reed and the Velvet
          Underground, and others <br /><br />• Shows how the British Invasion
          acted as the “detonator” to explode visionary music into the
          mainstream <br /><br />• Explains how 1960s rock and roll music
          transformed consciousness on both the individual and collective levels
          <br /><br />The 1960s were a time of huge transformation, sustained
          and amplified by the music of that era: Rock and Roll. During the 19th
          and 20th centuries visionary and esoteric spiritual traditions
          influenced first literature, then film. In the 1960s they entered the
          realm of popular music, catalyzing the ecstatic experiences that
          empowered a generation. <br /><br />Exploring how 1960s rock and roll
          music became a school of visionary art, Christopher Hill shows how
          music raised consciousness on both the individual and collective
          levels to bring about a transformation of the planet. The author
          traces how rock and roll rose from the sacred music of the African
          Diaspora, harnessing its ecstatic power for evoking spiritual
          experiences through music. He shows how the British Invasion,
          beginning with the Beatles in the early 1960s, acted as the
          “detonator” to explode visionary music into the mainstream. He
          explains how 60s rock and roll made a direct appeal to the
          imaginations of young people, giving them a larger set of reference
          points around which to understand life. Exploring the sources 1960s
          musicians drew upon to evoke the initiatory experience, he reveals the
          influence of European folk traditions, medieval Troubadours, and a
          lost American history of ecstatic politics and shows how a revival of
          the ancient use of psychedelic substances was the strongest agent of
          change, causing the ecstatic, mythic, and sacred to enter the
          consciousness of a generation. <br /><br />The author examines the
          mythic narratives that underscored the work of the Grateful Dead, the
          French symbolist poets who inspired Bob Dylan, the hallucinatory
          England of the Beatles’ Sgt. Pepper, the tale of the Rolling Stones
          and the Lord of Misrule, Van Morrison’s astral journeys, and the dark
          mysticism of Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground. Evoking the
          visionary and apocalyptic atmosphere in which the music of the 1960s
          was received, the author helps each of us to better understand this
          transformative era and its mystical roots.
