          New research and evidence that the Sphinx is thousands of years older
          than previously thought<br /><br />• Contrasts what Egyptologists
          claim about the Sphinx with historical accounts and new research
          including reanalysis of seismic studies and updates to Schoch’s water
          weathering research and Bauval’s Orion Correlation Theory<br /><br />•
          Examines how the Sphinx is contemporaneous with Göbekli Tepe, aligned
          with the constellation Leo, and was recarved during the Old Kingdom
          era of Egypt<br /><br />• Reveals that the Sphinx was built during the
          actual historical Golden Age of ancient Egypt, the period known in
          legend as Zep Tepi<br /><br />No other monument in the world evokes
          mystery like the Great Sphinx of Giza. It has survived the harsh
          climate of Egypt for thousands of years and will remain long after our
          own civilization is gone. According to orthodox Egyptology, the Sphinx
          was built around 2500 BCE as a memorial to the pharaoh Khafre. Yet
          this “fact” has scant to no supportive evidence. When was the Sphinx
          really built and, most importantly, why?<br /><br />In this
          provocative collaboration from two Egyptology outsiders, Robert M.
          Schoch, Ph.D., and Robert Bauval combine their decades of research to
          show how the Sphinx is thousands of years older than the conventional
          Egyptological timeline and was built by a long forgotten pre-Pharaonic
          civilization. They examine the known history of the Sphinx,
          contrasting what Egyptologists claim with prominent historical
          accounts and new research, including updates to Schoch’s geological
          water weathering research and reanalysis of seismic studies. Building
          on Bauval’s Orion Correlation Theory, they investigate the
          archaeoastronomical alignments of the monuments of the Giza Plateau
          and reveal how the pyramids and Sphinx were built to align with the
          constellations of Orion and Leo. Analyzing the evidence for a
          significantly older construction phase at Giza and the restoration and
          recarving of the Sphinx during the Old Kingdom era, they assert that
          the Sphinx was first built by an advanced pre-Pharaonic civilization
          that existed circa 12,000 years ago on the Giza Plateau,
          contemporaneous with the sophisticated Göbekli Tepe complex.
          <br /><br />The authors examine how the monuments at Giza memorialize
          Zep Tepi, the Golden Age of legend shown here to be an actual
          historical time period from roughly 10,500 BCE through 9700 BCE.
          Moving us closer to an understanding of the true age and purpose of
          the Great Sphinx, Schoch and Bauval provide evidence of an early high
          civilization witnessed by the Great Sphinx before the end of the last
          ice age.

          “For a quarter-century, Schoch’s analysis of weathering at Giza and
          Bauval’s archaeoastronomic discoveries have challenged the consensus
          on prehistory, not merely of Egypt but of the world. This book
          expertly summarizes their case and its triumphant vindication in the
          12,000-year-old sanctuary of Göbekli Tepe. The question is no longer
          whether they are right but where archaeology should go from here.”
