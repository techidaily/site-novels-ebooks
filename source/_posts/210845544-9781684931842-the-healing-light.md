          <p>
            The Healing Light (1947) by Agnes Sanford is a personal exploration
            and explanation of prayer and healing. By becoming a channel for
            God's love and power, Mrs. Sanford explains, we can heal ourselves,
            each other, and the world at large.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agnes Sanford (b. 1897, d. 1982) was born in China, the daughter of
            a Presbyterian missionary. She spent her youth and teen years in
            Shanghai, until leaving for the United States to attend college.
            After completing her schooling, she returned to China in 1919. It
            was while working as an English teacher at Soochow Academy in
            Shanghai that she met and married her husband, the missionary Edgar
            Sanford.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pair, along with their young son, returned to the U.S. in 1925,
            where Edgar received a job as a pastor in New Jersey. More children
            followed, but Agnes found herself depressed-a condition she suffered
            from for many years. When an Episcopalian priest, Hollis Colwell,
            laid hands on her and prayed over her, she found immediate relief
            from her symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Convinced by his healing abilities, Agnes began sending others to
            Colwell for healing. But he suggested that she, too, could channel
            the healing power of God. As she began to study God's Word in depth,
            she found that her prayers also could heal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Agnes began to teach and write on the subject of healing. Her first
            book, The Healing Light, shares her simple techniques for creating
            the right environment within ourselves to welcome God's healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            A recurring metaphor that she uses is that of electricity. If you
            flip on a light switch and the light doesn't come on, you would
            logically conclude that there is a problem with the lamp-not that
            electricity doesn't exist. Similarly, when our prayers aren't
            answered and healing doesn't come, it's not because there is no God,
            but because we are not properly connected to His love and energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            She writes, "...just as a whole world full of electricity will not
            light a house unless the house itself is prepared to receive that
            electricity, so the infinite and eternal life of God cannot help us
            unless we are prepared to receive that life within ourselves."
          </p>
          <p>
            Written in a friendly, conversational tone, Mrs. Sanford shares
            dozens of anecdotes of successful healing methods. While some of
            these modern miracles were accomplished through her own prayers,
            many others were the result of her sharing her techniques with
            others and allowing them to heal themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Mrs. Sanford was raised Presbyterian, her healing does not
            only live within the rigid confines of religious ideology. Her
            stories of healing include Jews, Roman Catholics, and children too
            young to understand any particular theology. As Glenn Clark explains
            in the introduction, her healing powers came "through simple
            exposure to the climate of faith and love."
          </p>
          <p>
            A decade after its release, The Healing Light became a foundational
            work of the Charismatic Movement. This theological movement within
            Christianity holds that baptism with the Holy Spirit can lead to a
            new awareness of reality, as well as gifts from God including gifts
            of healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, and speaking in tongues.
            This is in contrast to the more mainstream cessationist theology,
            which states that God's miracles only briefly existed in New
            Testament times, and ceased during the early centuries A.D.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Sanford was a prolific writer and speaker. She wrote over
            fifteen books and traveled extensively to minister in New Zealand,
            Australia, Scotland, Holland, and England. In her later years, she
            devoted her prayer energy to steadying the fault lines of Southern
            California, hoping to prevent or lessen the impact of earthquakes in
            the region. Interestingly, there were only three major earthquakes
            in the area in the 17 years that she lived and prayed there.
