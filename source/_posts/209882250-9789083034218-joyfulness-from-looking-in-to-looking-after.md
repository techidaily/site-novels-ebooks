          <p>
            If you want to experience a zest for life (Joy) in these hectic
            times, you will have to go on a journey of discovery, a journey
            which will take you from looking in to looking after. The first
            thing you will notice is that you don't get far on this journey if
            you are travelling alone. The current culture of 'me, me, me' and
            the emphasis on individual performance really get in the way of Joy.
            There are too many people who have lost their Joy and are
            experiencing depression or burn-out.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mindfulness and meditation can indeed help you to take the first and
            necessary step towards recovery, the step that takes you out of your
            mind, full of restless thoughts and worry about problems and their
            solutions. This is a very important, but difficult assignment for
            many people. However, in my experience this is not enough to help
            you get the true feeling of happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could describe Joyfulness as a logical consequence of
            Mindfulness. Joyfulness lets you experience the flow from a state of
            'Being'. The characteristics are movement, pleasure and
            creativeness, so you don't have to just sit still or concentrate.
            With Joyfulness, you break through the individualism which plays
            such a major role in the current selfie culture. With Joyfulness,
            you experience the most pleasure by being and creating together.
            Joyfulness takes you to that playful feeling you had as a child. If
            you can be your true self, and reveal that to others, you can then
            connect with them. You let them share in your Joy and that is so
            contagious that it can lead to amazing partnerships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discover your own Joy and radiate it! Not by looking for it. Not by
            trying to be someone. You don't perform from Joyfulness. Joy has
            always been inside you, but you lost it somewhere along the way in
            life. So you can recapture that feeling of Joy by choosing play and
            self-expression. And by simply being there for others, selflessly.
          </p>
          <p>The people around you need your Joy. The world needs your Joy!</p>
