            >A practical blueprint for overcoming loneliness and returning to a
            place of love, acceptance, and meaningful connection—from the
            spiritual leader and popular YouTuber behind
            <i>The Completion Process</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Following in the footsteps of the success of
          <i>The Completion Process,</i> bestselling author and modern spiritual
          leader Teal Swan offers an in-depth exploration and understanding of
          loneliness. Drawing on her extraordinary healing technique, the
          Connection Process, Teal offers a way to experience connection once
          again.<br /><br />
          Loneliness is reaching endemic proportions in our society, reflected
          by rising suicide rates and increased mental illness. Now, more than
          ever we need to find a way to connect. Loneliness is a feeling of
          separation or isolation; it is not necessarily the same as the
          physical state of being alone. This book is for people who suffer from
          loneliness, the kind that cannot be solved by simply being around
          other people. Their aloneness is a deeply embedded pattern that is
          both negative and painful; it is often fueled by trauma, loss,
          addiction, grief and a lack of self-esteem and insecurity.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>The Anatomy of Loneliness,</i> Teal identifies the three pillars
          or qualities of loneliness: Separation, Shame and Fear and goes on to
          share her revolutionary technique; The Connection Process, a form of
          intuitive journeying, usually involving two people a ‘receiver’ and a
          ‘journeyer’. Through a series of exercises each person experiences
          ‘walls’ and ‘blockages’ as they move through the process both
          participants face their fears learning from these to reach a place of
          unconditional love and acceptance.
