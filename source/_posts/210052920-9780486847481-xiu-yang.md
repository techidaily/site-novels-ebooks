          "A beautiful and timely gift." — Sifu Matthew Cohen, Founder, Sacred
          Energy Arts Founder<br /><br />
          For centuries, Chinese sages, rulers, and spiritual seekers have
          embraced a simple yet powerful principle that enables them to live in
          harmony with the source of nature and all life. The art of
          self-cultivation or xiu yang (pronounced "sheow yaang") is based on
          the concept that we can nurture our capacity to be fully human and
          awake, finding balance and peace in our home, life, and community.
          Author Mimi Kuo-Deemer leads readers through a combination of
          practices from meditation and mindfulness to yoga and qigong, offering
          ancient wisdom to help with contemporary challenges.<br /><br />
          "Exquisite ... for anyone interested in building a sustainable life
          that is imbued with vibrant healthy, mental and emotional clarity, and
          the most basic human need of all: happiness." — Donna Farhi, author
          of&nbsp;<i>Yoga Mind, Body &amp; Spirit</i><br /><br />
          "A treasure chest for the heart and mind, a potent tonic for body and
          breath, and a vibrant life essence for the spirit." — Simon Low,
          Principal of The Yoga Academy<br /><br />
          "Kuo-Deemer doesn't simply write about these ancient teachings, she
          shares the fruits of practicing them, processing timeless truths in
          her own heart and mind and body, so that we can do so in ours.
          <i>Xiu Yang</i> gives glimpses of her own transformational
          self-cultivation, while showing us a path for our own." — Martin
          Lylward, Co-Founder, The Mindfulness Institute<br /><br />
          "Profound and powerful." — Norman Blair, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Brightening Our Inner Skies</i
          ><br /><br /><i>"</i>Almost lost in China over the past century's
          onslaught of modernisation, xiu yang is now at the centre of Chinese
          people's search for values and belief — a tribute to the enduring
          power of these ancient practices. In this slender but powerful book,
          Mimi Kuo-Deemer unlocks xiu yang for the modern reader, de-mystifying
          it without losing the eternal, timeless qualities that have made it
          one of Chinese people's most potent ways of living a good, honourable,
          happy, and healthy life." — Ian Johnson, Pulitzer Prize-winning author
          of<i>&nbsp;The Souls of China: The Return of Religion After Mao</i>
