            <i>Falling Down and Getting Up</i> is an invitation to view
            adversity from a new perspective. In this gentle, insightful guide,
            Mark Nepo helps readers navigate the challenges of life by
            transforming their experience into a chance for deepening and
            renewal. <br /><br />Each one of us is offered opportunities to
            choose between surviving and thriving, managing risk and enhancing
            risk, opening and closing, giving and receiving, living a balance
            between solitude and community. We can choose to enlarge our sense
            of things when pain and fear make us small. We can choose to delight
            in the never-ending practice of course-correcting and tuning as we
            go. <i>Falling Down and Getting Up</i> introduces readers to their
            own gifts and wisdom, helping them explore the perennial practices
            and choice-points we all face in life.<br /><br />Mark Nepo is a
            master teacher who has been convening circles and guiding retreats
            for fifty years all over the world. Beloved as a poet, teacher, and
            storyteller, he has been called “one of the finest spiritual guides
            of our time,” “a consummate storyteller,” and “an eloquent spiritual
            teacher.” Filled with humble insights and wise words,
            <i>Falling Down and Getting Up</i> will encourage and inspire
            readers from every walk of life.

          "A wonderful book, full of wisdom and insight." <br />—<i>Parabola</i>
          <br /><br />"Drawn from Mark Nepo's many years of teaching, this book
          offers a transformative journey that helps us to connect with and
          explore the eternal part of ourselves—our spiritual nature, our
          essence. Falling down is part of the human journey, but Mark shows us
          how it can become a path of spiritual transformation. In this book,
          Mark unfolds the courage that can befriend us in learning the dance of
          falling down and getting up with grace."<br />—<b>Baptist de Pape</b>,
          author of the book <i>The Power of the Heart<br /></i><br />"In
          <i>Falling Down and Getting Up, </i>Mark Nepo shares a lifetime of
          hard-earned wisdom through his moving, heart-warming vignettes that
          are like songs for the soul taking us home to ourselves. Like a jazz
          virtuoso, Mark weaves his poetry and teachings to move gently, yet
          persistently, into your blood and bones as he helps us move from the
          fear of pain and suffering to the rebirth of ever getting back up as
          we learn and grow together. I hope you will find a way to read this
          book slowly, deeply, and let it nourish you with its gentle, wise and
          heart-felt guidance."<br />— <b>Michael Brant DeMaria</b>, Ph.D.,
          four-time Grammy nominated Recording Artist and author of
          <i>When All Is Lost<br /></i><br />“Once more, I’m inspired as Nepo
          hits the perfect note that is needed in these most challenging times.
          It’s easy to open one’s heart to his writings because he never
          lectures. Rather, he leads us with stories, poetry, metaphors,
          significant questions, and lessons he’s gleaned from the wisdom of
          authentic teachers. All this has a ring of deep truth. Nepo gives wind
          to our sails as we navigate the waters of falling down and getting up.
          I recommend this book with unreserved enthusiasm.”<br />
          — <b>Justine Willis Toms</b>, co-founder and host of
          <i>New Dimensions Radio</i> and author of
          <i>Small Pleasures: Finding Grace in a Chaotic World</i
          ><br /><br />"Mark Nepo returns. Hallelujah! Our ever-enfolding,
          always-growing, supremely astute sage of our times sings to us once
          again and I couldn’t be happier! Through the comforting beauty of
          <i>Falling Down</i>, I felt understood, awakened, and expanded, not
          from fantasy but from experiencing, through his words, the deeper
          majesty in my everyday life. The majesty that is in <i>all</i> of our
          lives. This will be yet another of his masterpieces I will return to,
          again and again, to luxuriate in his exquisite expression. You’ll want
          to clutch this one close to your heart, to make it a part of you. What
          a gift!"<br />
          — <b>Kris Ferraro</b>, International Energy Coach, speaker, and Author
          of <i>Your Difference is Your Strength</i>, <i>Manifesting</i>, and
          the #1 Amazon bestseller <i>Energy Healing</i><br /><br />"Amid this
          luminous new collection of wisdom, Mark Nepo offers one of the most
          robust and tender teachings on grief I have come across. In Mark’s
          hands, pain becomes poetry, and enlarges our hearts enough to carry
          what we may have thought we couldn’t."<br />—<b>Mirabai Starr</b>,
          author of <i>Caravan of No Despair</i> and
          <i>Wild Mercy<br /><br /></i>"Mark Nepo has led workshops at Omega
          Institute for many years. His classes are like a gathering of
          travelers at an oasis, a nourishing stop on a long journey. Now, in
          this treasure of a book, we all get the chance to experience the magic
          Mark creates—the learning, the beauty, the healing. As Mark says, 'We
          need each other to heal one more time than we are broken.' This new
          book is sublime."<br />—<b>Elizabeth Lesser</b>, co-founder of Omega
          Institute, and author of <i>Broken Open</i> and
          <i>Cassandra Speaks<br /><br /></i>“Mark Nepo’s words have been a
          friend by my side for as long as I can remember. Mark uses language to
          weave us into the web of life, so we feel held, seen, and a part of
          something beautiful. He has done it yet again with
          <i>Falling Down and Getting Up</i>. Mark has travelled into the depths
          of what it means to be human and brought back this book for all of us.
          When you fall, and you will because we all do, this book will be an
          outstretched hand helping you to stand again, and take the next
          step.“<br />—<b>Beth Kempton</b>, bestselling author of
