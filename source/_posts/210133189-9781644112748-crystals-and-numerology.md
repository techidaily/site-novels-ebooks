          • Explains how to calculate your personal numbers and work with
          gemstones to enhance the strengths of your numbers and overcome
          weaknesses <br /><br />• Explores which crystals resonate most with
          each number’s energy, including detailed descriptions of the
          gemstones’ spiritual, mental, and physical qualities alongside
          beautiful photographs <br /><br />• Offers affirmations, meditations,
          and crystal healing techniques to connect with the energies of the
          gemstones <br /><br />Numerology offers a surprisingly accurate tool
          to gain insight into your character, talents, and abilities by
          analyzing the numbers in your birthdate, the numeric values of the
          letters in your name, and the numbers that serendipitously appear in
          your life again and again. While our personal numbers are the mirror
          that reflects our inner world, crystals are our helpers in the outer
          world to harmonize the energies we were born with. They are gifts from
          the earth that we are offered to unfold our divine potential. Through
          their beauty and wisdom, they can help us be more in tune with our
          destiny. <br /><br />In this full-color guide, the authors explain how
          to calculate your personal numbers and work with the healing energies
          of gemstones to unfold the full potential your numbers reveal. Each of
          the numbers 0 to 9 is explained on the numerological level, including
          their qualities, energies, and how they act on human consciousness.
          The authors then describe which crystals resonate most with each
          number’s energy and which offer complementary energies, providing
          detailed descriptions of the gemstones’ spiritual, mental, and
          physical qualities alongside beautiful photographs. The authors also
          offer affirmations, meditations, and crystal healing techniques to
          connect with the energies of the gemstones. <br /><br />By working
          with the gemstones that resonate with your numerology, you can enhance
          the strengths of your personal numbers. If a certain number’s
          weaknesses are manifesting in your life, you can discover crystals
          that will help to integrate and balance the number’s hindering
          effects. Together, numbers and stones offer a wonderful possibility to
          find your own way, recognize your true self, heal, and harmonize with
          the world around you. Let the numbers guide you and the crystals
          empower you!

          <i>Crystals and Numerology</i> is packed full of information that is
          practical as well as inspirational and I love the combination of these
          two life tools. Readers will not only learn a lot about numbers and
          their energy, but also a great deal about crystals and how using them
          can impact one’s life.”
