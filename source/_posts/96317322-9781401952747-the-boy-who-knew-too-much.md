            >The compelling and heartwarming story of a young baseball prodigy
            who began sharing vivid memories of being famed American baseball
            player Lou Gehrig.</b
          ><br /><br />At the tender age of two, baseball prodigy Christian
          Haupt began sharing vivid memories of being a baseball player in the
          1920s and '30s. From riding cross-country on trains, to his fierce
          rivalry with Babe Ruth, Christian described historical facts about the
          life of American hero and baseball legend Lou Gehrig that he could not
          have possibly known at the time.<br />Distraught by her son's uncanny
          revelations, Christian's mother, Cathy, embarked on a sacred journey
          of discovery that would shake her beliefs to the core and forever
          change her views on life and death.<br />In this compelling and
          heartwarming memoir, Cathy Byrd shares her remarkable experiences, the
          lessons she learned as she searched to find answers to this great
          mystery, and a story of healing in the lives of these intertwined
          souls.<br />The Boy Who Knew Too Much will inspire even the greatest
          skeptics to consider the possibility that love never dies.

          "Byrd’s memoir almost reads like a suspenseful novel, and readers are
          sure to be gripped by the possible explanations she provides for (her
          son’s) seemingly inexplicable memories. She also thoughtfully reflects
          on her own spirituality, and the ways in which her son’s revelations
          challenged her Christian faith . . . On the whole, this is an
          affecting portrayal of parenthood, and an affectionate love letter
          from a mother to her unusual child. An eclectic mix of mystery,
          memoir, and the supernatural."<br />— <i>Kirkus Reviews</i
          ><br /><br />"This is a wonderful book, intelligent, humorous, and
          overflowing with spiritual insights—one of the most transformative and
          thought-provoking books I’ve ever encountered."<br />—
          <b>Jack Canfield</b>, co-creator of the <i>New York Times</i> #1
          best-selling series, <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul®</i><br /><br />"A
          riveting tale of a talented young boy with a love of the game and the
          natural talent to go along with it. More importantly, it is a story of
          how a mother’s love can defy all logic and move mountains. Cathy Byrd
          is one heck of a baseball mom and a true advocate for all
          children."<br />— <b>Tommy Lasorda</b>, National Baseball Hall of Fame
          Dodgers manager<br /><br />"A mother and son’s extraordinary story
          demonstrates how our connections with loved ones do not end with the
          death of the physical body. Love’s eternal bond brings our souls
          together again and again, leading to a richer sense of purpose in our
          lives."<br />— <b>Eben Alexander, M.D.</b>, neurosurgeon,
          <i>New York Times</i> #1 best-selling author of <i>Proof of Heaven</i
          ><br /><br />"This engaging, soulful, and highly entertaining memoir
          has the power to transform the way you think about life and death."<br />—
          <b>John Gray, Ph.D.</b>, <i>New York Times </i>#1 best-selling
          relationship author of all time, author of <i>Beyond Mars </i>and
          <i>Venus</i><br /><br />"In her inspirational new book, Cathy Byrd
          documents the compelling past-life memories of her young son. She also
          describes her own past-life regression recollections, linking both
          mother and son in a previous lifetime. The Boy Who Knew Too Much is an
          exciting journey into the mystery and power of past-life memories. I
          highly recommend this book."<br />— <b>Brian L. Weiss, M.D.</b>,
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of
          <i>Many Lives, Many Masters</i><br /><br />"Growing up in the 1970s,
          I’ve always viewed the Lou Gehrig story as somewhat mystical, from the
          famous farewell speech to my all-time favorite movie, The Pride of the
          Yankees. After reading the amazing journey of Cathy Byrd and Christian
          Haupt, the spirit of Gehrig resonates for the next generation of
          baseball fans to appreciate."<br />— <b>Mark Langill</b>, team

        </h4>
        <p>
          Cathy Byrd is a busy realtor and mother of two young children who
          never had aspirations of becoming a writer until her son began sharing
          vivid memories of being a baseball player in the 1920s and ‘30s. When
          she is not busy writing or selling homes, the most likely place to
          find Cathy is on a baseball field in Southern California.
