            Philippe Tahon has made a thrilling discovery, and it's something
            many of us will want to know. This highly sought-after London
            psychotherapist has created a unique set of tools that not only
            enabled him to lose five stone, but is now doing the same for
            hundreds of others.<br /><br />In <i>Shrink</i>, Philippe shares his
            easy programme and teaches you to eat <b>mindfully</b>,
            <b>intuitively </b>and<b> positively</b>. He encourages you to throw
            away the rulebook and free yourself forever from emotional eating
            and the diet trap.<br /><br />In being <b>mindful</b> we can tell
            how hungry we really are. Using our <b>intuition</b>, we eat only
            what our body knows is good for us, and when. By eating
            <b>positively</b>, we no longer regard food as the enemy but make
            friends with it, embracing it for the pleasure and nourishment it
            brings. <br /><br />Philippe's holistic technique gives you back
            your confidence, allows you to retake control and enjoy food
            guilt-free. Step by step, his clients identify the patterns in their
            eating habits and learn how to eat what they like whilst losing
            weight for good. <br /><br />The simple beauty of this hugely
            successful programme is that it allows you to 'think like a shrink'
            and have the body you really want - for life.

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Former restaurateur and father of two Philippe Tahon switched careers
          - and countries - to become one of Europe's most sought after
          therapists and weight loss gurus who has helped hundreds of people
          free themselves from fad dieting, lose weight and keep it off for
          good. The best-kept secret of celebrities and therapists, his
          revolutionary approach has sparked national media interest.<br /><br />Philippe
          has a deep understanding of weight and self-image issues, having gone
          through a 15 year period of yo-yo weight loss and regain. After years
          of frustration and guilt, Philippe sold his Brussels restaurants,
          retrained as a psychotherapist and came up with his own unique weight
          loss programme. This not only helped him lose all five stone (70lbs)
          of his excess weight in less than a year but, in gently reprogramming
          his mind to create a benevolent self-awareness, it also improved his
          self-esteem.<br /><br />For the past 17 years, he has dedicated his
          life to helping hundreds of people face up to eating disorders and
          issues surrounding addiction and self-image. Whether celebrities or
          journalists, actors or housewives, almost all his clients have had
          amazing - and lasting - results.<br /><br />Find out more about
