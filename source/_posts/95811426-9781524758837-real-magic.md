            >The chief scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS)
            turns a critical eye toward such practices as telepathy,
            clairvoyance, precognition and psychokinesis. Are such powers really
            possible? Science says yes.</b
          ><br /><br />According to noted scientist and bestselling author of
          <i>The Conscious Universe</i>, Dean Radin, magic is a natural aspect
          of reality, and each of us can tap into this power with diligent
          practice.<br /><br />But wait, aren't things like ESP and telepathy
          just wishful thinking and flights of the imagination? Not according to
          the author, who worked on the US government's top secret psychic
          espionage program known as Stargate. Radin has spent the last forty
          years conducting controlled experiments that demonstrate that thoughts
          are things, that we can sense others' emotions and intentions from a
          distance, that intuition is more powerful than we thought, and that we
          can tap into the power of intention (think The Secret, only on a more
          realistic and scientific level). These dormant powers can help us to
          lead more interesting and fulfilling lives. <br /><br />Beginning with
          a brief history of magic over the centuries (what was called magic two
          thousand years ago is turning out to be scientific fact today), a
          review of the scientific evidence for magic, a series of simple but
          effective magical techniques (the key is mental focus, something elite
          athletes know a lot about), Radin then offers a vision of a
          scientifically-informed magic and explains why magic will play a key
          role in frontiers of science.

          “A thought-provoking book.&nbsp;The author makes a convincing case for
          the reality and significance of magic.”

            of Physics, University of Cambridge <br /></b
          ><br />
          “The modern scientific world is experiencing a radical shift in its
          understanding of our reality, originating in the deep mystery of
          quantum physics almost a century ago, and maturing through the
          refinement of the mind-brain relationship, and of the very nature of
          consciousness. In <i>Real Magic</i>, Dean Radin, as one of the world’s
          leading scientific investigators of this exciting frontier, reveals
          the detailed nature of this world-changing mindscape in an arena that
          many will find illustrative of the true potential of this new dawn of
          understanding: the reality of certain forms of “magic,” as we come to
          a far more powerful manifestation of our free will, and a much deeper
          knowing of the natural world and of our powers on emerging reality.
          Highly recommended!" —<b

          “Filled with fascinating facts and intriguing ideas,
          <i>Real Magic</i> places the laboratory findings from parapsychology
          in the broader context of centuries of magic practices.&nbsp; This
          wholly original work then points toward new understandings of reality
          that can no longer be ignored.”

          “<i>Real Magic </i>illustrates the limitations of 20th century science
          and proposes a more comprehensive view that incorporates ideas that
          have been associated with magic throughout the ages. Blending history,
          humor, and plausible hypotheses, Dean Radin illustrates that there is
          a staggering amount of evidence for a broader view of science that
          offers hope for the future of humanity.”<b>

            Irvine and 2016 President of the American Statistical Association</b
          ><br /><br />
          &nbsp;“Dean Radin writes about all those scientifically and
          experimentally proven findings that for most people, are beyond
          imagination, mysterious, or even impossible. This is what Radin calls
          ‘magic’. Everybody and everything are always interrelated,
          interacting, and interconnected, beyond time and space. To better
          understand this challenging new worldview we need a new paradigm in
          science. Highly recommended.”

            <i>Consciousness Beyond Life</i><br

          <br />“Knowing Dean Radin’s scientific work (and appreciating his
          sense of humor!), I knew I’d like <i>Real Magic</i>, but after the
          first page I was hooked and read the whole book in a day.&nbsp;
          Parapsychologists have too often gotten stuck in abstractions about
          psychic abilities, but Radin now situates parapsychology where it
          belongs: it’s about magic.&nbsp; And magic is about humanness and our
          spiritual nature, not just spells and love potions. Read, enjoy,
          learn!”&nbsp;<b

            Transpersonal Psychology, Palo Alto, CA.</b
          ><br /><br />
          “<i>Real Magic </i>will be known as one of the few real
          paradigm-changing works of science. Radin builds a case, supported by
          plenty of data as well as by theoretical ideas that are all real and
          can be studied. Consciousness is the foundation of everything. This is
          what makes magic so real—it will be the new science. A very delightful
          book, highly recommended.”

          “The real magic of Dean Radin is that he continually insists on a
          clear eyed, fact based assessment of the accumulating data that 'real
          magic' is real.&nbsp;The delightful, easily flowing nature of his text
          - covering complex histories of magic and high level scientific
          analyses - is, itself, magical.”

          “Dean Radin shows how even a weighty subject like the nexus of
          esoteric ideas and modern science can still be an entertaining, easy
          read. He teaches us here that real magic is not a regression to
          ancient superstition, but rather an intriguing and surprisingly
          persuasive anticipation of future science.”<b>

          “With scientific precision and an expanded model of consciousness
          based on many years of patient experimentation,
          <i>Real Magic</i> explores the new frontiers of what passes for
          "reality" in our modern world of quanta, entanglement and multiple
          dimensions. Magic is the ancient source of modern science: it reflects
          humanity's desire to control its environment and life itself. With
          clear <br />
          thought and welcome humor—a rare commodity in this field—Dean Radin
          shows that the study of magic is not only a matter of historical
          curiosity; it also holds an important key to future knowledge of
          ourselves and the universe our thoughts create."

          Radin explores the history and foundations of magic, proposing a
          worldview uniquely appropriate for the challenges of the 21st century.
          This book is a brilliantly organized bridge that spans the esoteric
          traditions, magical lore, parapsychology, and contemporary science.”

          >“We have entered an age when simple artificial neural networks
          (ANNs), with only a few hundred neurons, outperform humans in more and
          more tasks, forcing more and more people out of jobs and seriously
          threatening our future. How can a simple system of a thousand neurons
          outperform humans with billions of neurons and, as many of us believe
          from inescapable experience, some kind of real soul? The answer is
          that NNs are usually designed to&nbsp;<i>focus</i>. We, too, need to
          develop our own fullest ability to focus our own minds in order to
          keep up, to connect with each other better, and to survive and grow as
          a species. I commend Dean Radin for his efforts in&nbsp;<i
            >Real Magic&nbsp;</i
          >to extract what many esoteric traditions from all over the world have
          learned through time, to help us train ourselves to focus the full
          powers of our minds, and for moving us forward (like Freud and Jung)
          on the long, difficult, but all-important road to bring this line of
          inquiry into the forefront of science.”

          ><br /><br />"Some scientists are confident that we already know what
          is and is not possible. But the truth is that science is very much in
          its infancy. To advance our understanding requires bold excursions
          into domains some might consider heretical, including esoteric legends
          about magic that have persisted for thousands of years. This is what
          Dean Radin sets out to do with Real Magic. In my judgment, it succeeds
          in blazing new trails. Well worth the read."
          <b>—Kary Mullis PhD, Nobel Laureate (Chemistry)</b><br /><br />“There
          is a tacit agreement in conventional science to deny, ignore, and
          remain silent about the most astonishing fact of our lives: the
          capacity of our consciousness to shape our existence and the so-called
          physical world. This is the equivalent of blind men refusing the gift
          of vision. In <i>Real Magic</i>, Dean Radin challenges us to abandon
          this childish pretense, this taboo, not on the basis of faith but of
          science itself. Our future likely depends on how we respond to the key
          messages in <i>Real Magic</i>.”

          lays out impressive evidence that ‘there are more things in Heaven and
          Earth’ than are dreamed of in 21st century physics. How will this
          story end? Will 21st century physicists prove to be more like Galileo,

          historic and modern perspectives of magical practice.&nbsp; The modern
          ‘magic’ that Dean Radin refers to embodies a range of ‘psi’ phenomena
          whose occurrence is stubbornly statistically significant.&nbsp; Their
          magnitude may be modest, but after hundreds of thousands of high
          quality experiments, instances of remote viewing and precognition for
          example, are persistent outcomes that cannot be explained away by
          chance or poor methodology.&nbsp; From a conventional scientific point
          of view these are anomalies that do not fit the existing
          paradigm.&nbsp; For Dean Radin these phenomena are an inevitable
          consequence of a universal consciousness that underpins the very
          fabric of space-time itself.&nbsp; For most of us the myriad
          distractions of the everyday world dull our senses, but with concerted
          effort, yoga and meditation, it seems that gifted individuals might be
          capable of amazing things.&nbsp; But as Radin says “Magic is real, but
          no one said it’s going to be fast or easy.”&nbsp;<b
