            Today, more than ever, it seems as if most people are suffering from
            one ailment or the other. High blood pressure, diabetes, lupus,
            cancer, heart disease - it seems each one of us knows someone who is
            dealing with sickness, and many are asking "Will I be healed?"&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In her book,&nbsp;The Healing Network: Believe, Receive and Maintain
            your Healing, Mynesha J. Rogers reminds us that God wants us to be
            healed. God wants us to live healthy lives that are free from
            diseases. But&nbsp;the key to believing, receiving and maintaining
            our healing is found in our network. The Healing Network&nbsp;is a
            powerful book that focuses on the interconnection of&nbsp;faith,
            action, and relationships&nbsp;(The F.A.R principle) for our healing
            and wellbeing. In it you will discover:&nbsp;

            God still heals. He did it before. He is doing it now and He will do
            it again. Grounded in scripture and prayer, this book is&nbsp;a
            resource to help you to create your own Healing Network.

            It's time for you to believe, receive and maintain your healing!

          As a medical doctor, a minister of the gospel, a follower of Jesus
          Christ and one who has repeatedly witnessed the miraculous healing
          power of God first hand, The Healing Network is a timely work that
          strongly reminds us that God does indeed still heal! Using strong
          biblical support, vivid personal testimonies and sound input from
          expert medical resources, Rogers does an amazing job of both
          disseminating critical medical information while powerfully sharing
          the gospel of Jesus Christ in an innovative way. As a fellow proponent
          of holistic healing I left this reading feeling encouraged and
          invigorated in my birthright to and God's uncompromising promises of
          total and complete healing. I highly endorse The Healing Network as a
          necessary part of your reading library, not only in the wake of these
          unprecedented times, but as a resource and reminder to be consulted
          over and over again.&nbsp;

          The Healing Network: Believe, Receive, and Maintain Your Healing is
          founded on a steroid of strong faith, biblically based belief, and
          tried-and-true testimonies. This book will make you believe again in
          the truth of biblical miracles and give you every reason "to add to
          your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, to
          self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness, to godliness
          brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love" (II Peter 1:5-7
          NKJV). It is a book penned by a woman with the gift of healing and
          faith, a prophet of the Lord, with the heart of a pastor.&nbsp;
