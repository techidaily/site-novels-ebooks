            >Embrace adventures both big and small and pursue your wild ideas
            with this “profoundly inspiring and laugh-out-loud funny” (Jaimal
            Yogis, author of <i>The Fear Project</i>) guidebook from seasoned
            adventurer and podcaster Shelby Stanger.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Will to Wild</i> is an instruction manual to
          adventure. Your guide: enthusiastic outdoorswoman Shelby Stanger.
          Shelby has been teaching folks how to leap into the unknown since she
          taught her first surf class over twenty years ago. Over the years, she
          watched many of her students quit their jobs, end dysfunctional
          relationships, and move across the country for a healthier work-life
          balance—all after spending a bit of time in nature. Shelby marveled at
          the phenomenon. Being outside was changing the lives of her students,
          her peers, and herself. Shelby was so intrigued, she began to tell
          their stories, first as a writer and journalist, then as a podcast
          host for <i>Wild Ideas Worth Living</i>, REI Co-op Studio’s flagship
          podcast.<br />
          <br />With her first book, <i>Will to Wild</i>, Shelby shares all
          she’s witnessed and learned in her years covering adventurers. It’s
          the book she wishes she’d had when she’d first felt the urge to leap
          from familiar to wild terrain. The one that takes you step-by-step
          from the first inkling of inspiration for your own wild idea through
          fear and self-doubt and on to the finish line.<br />
          <br />In these pages, discover stories with practical tips and tactics
          from world-famous rock climbers and ultra-runners to longtime
          thru-hikers, surfers, and desk jockeys who’ve figured out how to get
          off the clock, and even a suburban mom who started teaching women to
          scale frozen waterfalls in her mid-fifties. Along with Shelby’s
          stories, they show you how to get unstuck, how to pay attention to
          “trail signs” that point you toward your adventure, how to face your
          fears, and what to do when everything goes haywire (which will likely
          never happen, never fear!). With Shelby’s characteristic strength and
          vulnerability, <i>Will to Wild </i>“is the ultimate guide for anyone
          looking to try something new” (Captain Liz Clark, author of
          <i>Swell</i>) and encourages you to break out of your comfort zones,
          get out into nature, and bring your own wild ideas to life. Whether
          you’re already an adventure junkie or someone who’s never set up a
          tent, there’s something inside these pages for you.
