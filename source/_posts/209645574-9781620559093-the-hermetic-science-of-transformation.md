          A classic initiatic primer for the serious magical aspirant, available
          now for the first time in English <br /><br />• Details occult
          purification and preparations for the path of natural and divine magic
          <br /><br />• Explains how initiation into the hermetic science
          transforms the novice not only mentally but also physically, altering
          even the very fluids of the body <br /><br />• Offers a return to the
          original hermetic path of initiation, following the strict procedures
          and symbolism as defined in the spiritual practices of Pythagoras and
          his tradition <br /><br />The main purpose of the hermetic science, as
          seen by Giuliano Kremmerz (1861-1930), Italian alchemist, hermeticist,
          philosopher, and member of the Ur Group, is to allow the adept to
          concentrate on the natural and divine magic that will allow him or her
          to develop the latent powers innate in every human being. The
          initiatory path this opens, one the author compares to the Royal Way
          of Alchemy, transforms the novice not only mentally but also
          physically, altering even the very fluids of his or her body. For
          Kremmerz, magic is the supreme science, the highest expression of what
          exists and what is possible. <br /><br />With this book, first
          published in Italian in 1897 and available here for the first time in
          English, Kremmerz sought to redefine magical initiation as well as
          other key components of the occult sciences. His aim was to bring the
          hermetic path of initiation back into alignment with the strict
          procedures and symbolism that defined the spiritual practices of
          Pythagoras and the heirs to his tradition. He visualized the initiate
          as a disciple who has escaped the stagnant water in which the rest of
          humanity is immersed and entered a state of non-ordinary
          consciousness, one that allows for the successful pursuit of
          realization and contact with the magical will. <br /><br />In this
          transformative initiatory guide, Kremmerz details the occult
          purification and preparation the path of natural and divine magic
          requires. The spiritual course advocated by Kremmerz is arduous--to
          move forward on the path of true realization, one that will allow the
          initiate to “climb to heaven” while still alive, the aspirant must
          commit to total severance from everyday life. Yet Kremmerz’s words
          themselves serve to trigger the beginning of transformation within us,
          making the very act of reading this primer the first step on the path
          of initiation into the hermetic science.

          It is time that Giuliano Kremmerz--the other great master of initiatic
          magic in Itlay, besides Julius Evola, and founder of the Brotherhood
          of Myriam--is properly introduced to the anglephone world.
          <i>The Hermetic Science of Transformation </i>presents a thoughtful
          selection of Kemmerz’s writings, which includes his main doctrines and
          practical teachings.

        <p>
          Giuliano M. Kremmerz (1861-1930), also known as J. M. Kremm-Erz and
          born as Ciro Formisano, was an Italian alchemist, hermeticist,
          philosopher, and prominent member of the Ur Group, alongside Julius
          Evola. He was initiated into the mysteries of the Sacred Science by
          Pasquale De Servis, known as Izar, and published writings on natural
          and divine magic through the journal Il Mondo Secreto. In 1896 he
          founded the Schola Philosophica Hermetica Classica Italica and its
          associated body Fratellanza Terapeutica Magica di Miriam (Therapeutic
          and Magic Brotherhood of Miriam), a school and group still in
          operation in Italy today.
