            In this insightful memoir, Athan East entertainingly describes his
            upbringing in traditional Chinese religious worship, and how his
            search for deeper meaning, along with an increasingly desperate
            quest to find a cure for his disabled daughter, led to his discovery
            of&nbsp;Vibrant Celestial Meditation.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Guided by meditation master Bhai Sahib, Athan East recounts the
            life-transforming experiences he has had over three decades as a
            member of a meditation group in Kuala Lumpur. The spiritual
            knowledge he has accumulated proves to be hard-won. Honestly, and
            often humorously, he recounts coming face-to-face with his personal
            shortcomings, the struggles he had to overcome them,&nbsp;and the
            profound understanding of his life and his family's situation he
            received as a result. One quite unexpected breakthrough is that his
            wife is able to spontaneously connect to higher spiritual beings.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Search of The Infinite passionately and non-dogmatically explores
            ideas and experiences all readers will relate to. Major themes
            include health, relationships, children, money, karma, spiritual
            awakening and growth, the nature and benefits of meditation, the
            usefulness of reading the world's greatest spiritual texts, our
            transition into the afterlife, salvation, the role of the guru, and
            how The Infinite guides us all back to our spiritual home.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a book that readers seeking to understand themselves as
            spiritual beings will find not just informative but, in places,
            revelatory. A vibrant personal account of one man's spiritual
            discoveries, In Search of The Infinite offers illuminating insights
            into how we may live spiritually in the modern world.

          "A book that was hard to put down. Athan East writes from the heart,
          with raw vulnerability. The reality of his upbringing and how it
          affected his views on spirituality is powerful. His determination to
          find his own spiritual truth was fueled by his quest to find his
          daughter's cure. This book beautifully explores his preconceived
          notions on spirituality, his search for meaning, and the importance of
          connecting to something nobler than himself. It is packed with humour
          and unique revelations, and intelligently explores the mystical and
          spiritual aspects of life. The part of this book that caught my
          attention the most is when the author meets a spiritual luminary who
          teaches him how to awaken his spirit simply, naturally and
          effortlessly through Vibrant Celestial Meditation and how it quickly
          transformed him to trust his infinite self. A must-read for anyone
          wondering about their own&nbsp;spiritual journey."&nbsp;-&nbsp;Simran

          "A fascinating journey and raw account of the writer's journey from a
          traumatised childhood&nbsp;to eventual liberation. Filled with
          humility and humour and describing many wondrous experiences with his
          meditation teacher, Athan East has written a uniquely illuminating
          account of his worldly and spiritual life." - Ross Corry, meditation

          journey to find a cure for his daughter's ailment and in the process
          discovers the purpose of his life through the help of a guru who
          deciphers new spiritual meaning from the scriptures of the world. -

          "Athan East's memoir presents a fascinating journey of
          spiritual&nbsp;evolution, an instinctive quest for the Self or Atma,
          which Vedanta&nbsp;declares is our essential, eternal, divine
          nature."&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;Balakrishnan Ramaneyah, author

          "An inspiring heartfelt account of one man, his family, friends and
          spiritual associates. I empathise with his experiences emotionally,
          having similar ups and downs. The book brought about tears, laughter
          and a great appreciation of his experiences, and I put it down with a
          heartfelt desire to be a more loving, kind and compassionate being.
          Many blessings to you Athan East."&nbsp;-&nbsp;Marc Floreani
