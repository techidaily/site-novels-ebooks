              >A revised and expanded edition of the definitive guide to the
              Diamond Approach, the modern contemplative practice that
              integrates psychology and spirituality and emphasizes the
              importance of self-inquiry.
            </b></b
          ><br /><br />The Diamond Approach has been developed and taught over
          the last forty-five years by Hameed Ali, who is known chiefly by his
          pen name, A. H. Almaas. This book, the first to offer a full overview
          of the Diamond Approach, is now revised and expanded with a new
          foreword by Almaas, a new preface by the author, and a new chapter
          that explores the most recent developments in Almaas's teaching and
          practice methods. Author John Davis offers a rich, compelling
          introduction to the unique spiritual tradition that philosopher Ken
          Wilber recommends as "the most balanced of the widely available
          spiritual psychologies/therapies." <br /><br />Influenced by ancient
          traditions such as Sufism and Buddhism as well as by modern
          psychology, the Diamond Approach is particularly well-suited to
          twenty-first century seekers who embrace both spirituality and
          science. Beginning with an account of his own work with the Diamond
          Approach, Davis proceeds to outline the tradition's central practice
          of Inquiry, a form of open-ended exploration of present-moment
          experience akin to mindfulness practice. From there, he launches
          readers into an exploration of metaphysical concepts such as soul,
          space, Essence, self-realization, and the dimensions of Being. Complex
          yet concise, profound yet accessible,
          <i>The Diamond Approach</i> offers readers bold new perspectives on
          reality and human potential.

          “The work of A. H. Almaas places him among the greatest
          psychologists/spiritual teachers alive today. His brilliant vision of
          the human psyche embraces our Being from early development to the
          highest realms of spirit. From this he then offers a new language and
          direct approach for awakening to this manifold nature.”—Jack
          Kornfield, author of <i>A Path with Heart</i>, coauthor of
          <i>Seeking the Heart of Wisdom</i><br /><br />“I myself can recommend
          the Diamond Approach as probably the most balanced of the widely
          available spiritual psychologies/therapies.”—Ken Wilber, author of
          <i>A Brief History of Everything</i> and <i>The Integral Vision</i
          ><br /><br />“This is the first book to bring the main ideas of the
          Diamond Approach together in one place. That makes it an invaluable
          resource for every serious student of consciousness and
          psychology.”—Sherry Ruth Anderson, coauthor of
          <i>The Feminine Face of God</i> and <i>The Cultural Creatives</i>
