          <i>The Earth Chronicles</i> series is based on the premise that
          mythology is not fanciful but the repository of ancient memories; that
          the Bible ought to be read literally as a historic/scientific
          document; and that ancient civilizations--older and greater than
          assumed--were the product of knowledge brought to Earth by the
          Anunnaki, "Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came." <br /><br /><i
            >The 12th Planet</i
          >, the first book of the series, presents ancient evidence for the
          existence of an additional planet in the Solar System: the home planet
          of the Anunnaki. In confirmation of this evidence, recent data from
          unmanned spacecraft has led astronomers to actively search for what is
          being called "Planet X." <br /><br />The subsequent volume,
          <i>The Stairway to Heaven</i>, traces man's unending search for
          immortality to a spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula and to the Giza
          pyramids, which had served as landing beacons for it--refuting the
          notion that these pyramids were built by human pharaohs. Recently,
          records by an eye witness to a forgery of an inscription by the
          pharaoh Khufu inside the Great Pyramid corroborated the book's
          conclusions. <br /><br /><i>The Wars of Gods and Men</i>, recounting
          events closer to our times, concludes that the Sinai spaceport was
          destroyed 4,000 years ago with nuclear weapons. Photographs of Earth
          from space clearly show evidence of such an explosion.
          <br /><br />Such gratifying corroboration of audacious conclusions has
          been even swifter for <i>The Lost Realms</i>. In the relatively short
          interval between the completion of the manuscript and its publication,
          archaeologists, linguists, and other scientists have offered a
          "coastal theory" in lieu of the "frozen trekking" one to account for
          man's arrival in the Americas--in ships, as this volume has concluded.
          These experts have "suddenly discovered 2,000 years of missing
          civilization" in the words of a Yale University scholar--confirming
          this book's conclusion--and are now linking the beginnings of such
          civilizations to those of the Old World, as Sumerian texts and
          biblical verses.<br /><br />For the first time, the entire
          <i>Earth Chronicles</i> series is now available in a hardcover
          collector's edition.

        <p>
          Zecharia Sitchin was born in Russia and raised in Palestine, where he
          acquired a profound knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other
          Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and
          archaeology of the Near East. He was distinguished by his ability to
          translate and interpret ancient Sumerian and other ancient texts. A
          graduate of the University of London, he worked as a journalist and
          editor in Israel for many years before making his home in New York
          City.
