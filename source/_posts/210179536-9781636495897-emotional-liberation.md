            Imagine that whenever you feel bad, you could always know why and,
            more importantly, what you need to do to feel better. You'd never be
            stuck in anxiety, depression, or dysfunction. You would handle any
            new crisis and recover from upsets quickly.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we've all experienced trauma and the pain that causes
            heavy emotions and everyday reactions. Mindful processing of
            emotions is the key to recovery. Discover how your feelings can be
            tools for personal growth. Emotional Liberation teaches you to work
            well with your feelings and take control of situations that upset
            you, with practical tools to heal old wounds, find empowerment from
            trauma, and transform self-defeating patterns.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            When emotionally agile, you can handle strong emotions and keep your
            cool when others are losing theirs. When emotionally skillful, you
            understand what others are feeling and can help them, rather than
            being triggered and drawn into their drama. Emotional Liberation is
            the freedom to live fully and authentically, and to move through the
            ups and downs of life with wisdom and grace.

          I was so surprised at the changes that came from the power&nbsp;of
          validating my feelings. I now have the tools to heal myself&nbsp;for a
          lifetime of emotional well-being.

          In his groundbreaking work, GuruMeher Khalsa reveals the&nbsp;pivotal

          This book elucidates practical therapeutic strategies that facilitate
          a positive relationship with one's emotional characteristic, history,
          and patterns of behavior to bring about an elevated emotional
          maturity, intelligence and a personal transformation.

          Having followed GuruMeher's work for the past 40 years, it
          is&nbsp;with great pleasure I endorse his new
          book.&nbsp;Emotional&nbsp;Liberation&nbsp;gives great hope for this
          world by elevating us to&nbsp;live a more loving and nurturing life.
          Thank you, GuruMeher!

          This work with grief has got me feeling joy. I'm excited
          about&nbsp;life again.

          GuruMeher's work has done wonders for me and so many of&nbsp;my
          clients who suffer from trauma-based shame and lack of&nbsp;self-love.

          I've learned from this work that emotions are messages that&nbsp;are
          meant to help us get to a state of peace. I can now use&nbsp;every
          painful emotion constructively. When I recognize and&nbsp;allow them,
          go into my heart and listen, something&nbsp;transformative happens. It
          never fails.

          I now see how my past trauma was at the core of everything&nbsp;that
          was holding me back. I pushed through life so hard, even&nbsp;success
          was painful.&nbsp;Emotional Liberation&nbsp;has helped me turn&nbsp;my
          numbed shame into self-love.
