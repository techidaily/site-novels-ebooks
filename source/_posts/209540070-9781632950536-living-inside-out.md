          coach, trainer and speaker, she offers hands-on leadership and
          self-empowerment training through one-on-one and group sessions. Her

          no-nonsense woman, a mother of three and an absolute lover of life.
          She is passionate about creating a life that is both fulfilling and
          successful and wants to help others do the same. She is a lifelong
          learner and loves new discoveries.Els has been working in large
          corporations for most of her professional career until she decided it
          was time to slow down. For 4 years she stayed at home and took care of
          her children, the household and herself. Those 4 years were the
          beginning of her transformation into who she is today. She took enough
          time to think things through, to figure out what she was all about and
          to convince herself that there had to be more to life than what she
          was experiencing.And there was... She discovered that the hard way.
          She went through some rough times, going from a divorce to losing
          faith in herself and in the world. But giving up was no option as she
          had to take responsibility for the wellbeing of her children. So she
          stood up and fought back. She struggled her way through and regained
          consciousness from a very deep sleep she was residing in. She turned a
          life of mediocrity into a life of passion, fulfillment and success.
