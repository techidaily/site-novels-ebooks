              >"I believe that the discoveries in this book can change our
              understanding of how we store emotional experiences and in so
              doing, change our lives. <i>The Emotion Code</i> has already
              changed many lives around the world, and it is my hope that
              millions more will be led to use this simple tool to heal
              themselves and their loved ones."—Tony Robbins</b
            ><br /><br />In this newly revised and expanded edition of
            <i>The Emotion Code</i>, renowned holistic physician and lecturer
            Dr. Bradley Nelson skillfully lays bare the inner workings of the
            subconscious mind. He reveals how emotionally-charged events from
            your past can still be haunting you in the form of "trapped
            emotions"—emotional energies that literally inhabit your body. These
            trapped emotions can fester in your life and body, creating pain,
            malfunction, and eventual disease. They can also extract a heavy
            mental and emotional toll on you, impacting how you think, the
            choices that you make, and the level of success and abundance you
            are able to achieve. Perhaps most damaging of all, trapped emotional
            energies can gather around your heart, cutting off your ability to
            give and receive love. <br /><br />
            <i>The Emotion Code</i> is a powerful and simple way to rid yourself
            of this unseen baggage. Dr. Nelson’s method gives you the tools to
            identify and release the trapped emotions in your life, eliminating
            your “emotional baggage,” and opening your heart and body to the
            positive energies of the world. Filled with real-world examples from
            many years of clinical practice, <i>The Emotion Code</i> is a
            distinct and authoritative work that has become a classic on
            self-healing.

          Praise for The Emotion Code: <br /><br />"I believe that the
          discoveries in this book can change our understanding of how we store
          emotional experiences and in so doing, change our lives.
          <i>The Emotion Code</i> has already changed many lives around the
          world, and it is my hope that millions more will be led to use this
          simple tool to heal themselves and their loved ones."—Tony Robbins<br /><br />"In
          this wonderful book, Dr. Brad Nelson gives us a truly evolved model of
          how we get sick and how we can indeed heal. He brilliantly teaches us
          by what means a broad spectrum of trapped emotions can be stored in
          our bodies--limiting the expression of health-- and then he provides
          us the practical tools to free ourselves from the chains of those
          self-limiting emotions. Read it and become your own healer!"<br />—Dr.
          Joe Dispenza, New York Times best-selling author of
          <i>You are the Placebo: Making Your Mind Matter</i><br /><br />"Dr.
          Bradley Nelson's book, <i>The Emotion Code</i> has the potential to
          change the entire paradigm of self-help and self-health. If you are
          open to a future that is radically different from the one we are
          currently experiencing, you must read this book, and have your mind
          forever opened to perhaps the simplest yet most powerful healing
          method the world has ever known."<br />—George Noory, host of the
          nationally syndicated radio show Coast to Coast AM<br /><br />"I’ve
          read hundreds of self-help books, but
          <i>The Emotion Code</i> literally gives you the tools to create your
          own reality. We all have trapped emotions and baggage, so why not
          learn the tools to let go of the past to start creating your
          future."<br />—Frazier Bailey, Director E-motion &amp; Root Cause
          Documentary Films<br /><br /><i>"The Emotion Code</i> allows us to
          rise out of pain, not only to help ourselves but to help those who
          have been victimized and abused."<br />—Tim Ballard, Founder of
          Operation Underground Railroad <br /><br />“If you are looking for a
          simple and inexpensive way to get healthier, make more money, and have
          more love in your life, look no further. Simple, effective and
          powerful, it is a method that anyone can learn and use." <br />—Alex
          Loyd PhD, ND, author of the bestselling <i>The Healing Code</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>The Emotion Code</i> catapults us light years beyond
          conventional explanations of seemingly random symptoms and disease…
          this book is about you, your life, and every relationship that you’ll
          ever experience. I have no doubt that <i>The Emotion Code</i> is
          destined to become a cornerstone for the healing of the new
          millennium.” <br />—Gregg Braden, New York Times bestselling author of
          <i>Human by Design</i> and <i>The Divine Matrix</i
          ><br /><br />"Bradley Nelson’s Passion to create
          <i>The Emotion Code</i> and to clear and heal others of inner darkness
          makes him a True Champion of Life, Joy, Happiness and Fulfillment. In
          my Heart of Hearts I know Bradley Nelson is a Fabulous Gift to the
          People of this World." <br />—Don Tolman, The Whole Food Medicine

          vast majority of people on this planet have a ‘wall' of energy around
          their hearts that has been created by the subconscious mind to protect
          the heart from breaking. Be patient, learn this process of emotional
          healing, use it to heal yourself, your children, and your loved ones."
