          <p>
            Awakening the Healing Power Within is based on my twenty-five years
            of experience as a health and wellness professional and intuitive
            healer. It is through the process of counseling hundreds of clients
            and doing independent research on holistic nutrition and natural
            therapies that has led me to this point. As a medium, a large part
            of this book has been channeled during meditation. It is through the
            help of ascended masters, spirit guides, archangels, and departed
            healers that enabled me to synthesize these ideas into a coherent
            book.
          </p>

          <p>
            Awakening the Healing Power Within is designed for individuals to
            take back their power and learn how to heal themselves. It was
            Hippocrates who said, "If you are not your own doctor, you are a
            fool." The intention of this book is to educate and inform the
            reader so that they may become an advocate for their own health. The
            only person who can save you from disease and illness is yourself.
            It is the responsibility of each person to take a proactive approach
            to their health and wellness.
          </p>

            Awakening the Healing Power Within takes the reader from beginning
            to end on their wellness journey. Within this book are all the
            resources and information you will need to take back and reclaim
            your vitality, health, and longevity. It gives information on how to
            heal the mind, body, and soul from a holistic approach. It is only
            through mastering all three aspects that true healing is possible.
            By taking small actionable steps every day toward wellness, the
            reader will undoubtedly become an improved version of themselves and
            create changes in their health that seems like miracles. We all have
            the innate capacity to heal ourselves, as we are spiritual beings
            having a brief human experience. It is through these spiritual
            abilities that we possess in each of us and is our birthright that
            will lead us back to our true state, which is perfect health.
            Remember, our bodies were designed to function with optimal health,
            not disease and illness, as most of us have become accustomed to.
