            ><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER •&nbsp;For readers of
            <i>Proof of Heaven</i>, the astonishing story of a woman with an
            extraordinary psychic gift—and a powerful message from the Other
            Side that can help us to live more beautifully in the here and
            now.</b
          ><br /><br />Laura Lynne Jackson is a wife, a mother, a high school
          English teacher—and a psychic medium. Where most believe an
          impenetrable wall divides the world between the living and the dead,
          Jackson sees brilliant cords of light. She has dedicated her life to
          exploring our connection to the Other Side, conversing with departed
          loved ones, and helping people come to terms with loss. In The Light
          Between Us, she writes with clarity and grace, addressing the eternal
          questions that vex us all: Why are we here? What happens when we die?
          How do we find our true path in this life? Laura Lynne Jackson’s story
          offers a new understanding of the vast reach of our consciousness and
          enlarges our view of the human experience.<br /><br /><b

          “Having personally witnessed the reality of Laura Lynne Jackson’s
          mediumship abilities, I was elated to find that she was sharing her
          story through this marvelous book. Her personal story is beautifully
          wrought, weaving together the extreme challenge of the scientific
          proof of mediumship with the profound healing aspects of love and the
          overwhelming evidence for the eternity of our souls and their
          connections. As the world (including the scientific community) awakens
          to the far grander capabilities of the human spirit and the deep
          mysteries of consciousness as fundamental in the universe, this book
          will serve as a brilliant milestone, marking our passage toward
          comprehending the deeper truths of our existence.”<b
