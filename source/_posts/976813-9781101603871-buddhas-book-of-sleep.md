          ><br /><br /><b>Enlightened sleep practices for the modern mind.</b>
          <p>
            <b>Buddha’s Book of Sleep</b> is the first book to address sleep
            disturbances with techniques from mindfulness meditation. Yet this
            is a natural choice—mindfulness meditation has proven effective for
            psychological problems such as stress, depression, and anxiety, and
            these very issues are what become sleep problems when your head hits
            the pillow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Divided into two sections, the book approaches sleep deprivation
            with a combination of wisdom and practical meditation exercises. The
            first section explains why mindfulness meditation, with its basis in
            self-awareness, is appropriate for dealing with sleeping problems,
            and details the practices of this increasingly popular form of
            meditation. The second section features seven specific exercises to
            do at bedtime or in the wee hours of the morning, or whenever your
            sleeping trouble occurs. With a foreword by <b>Thich Nhat Hanh</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Providing a new perspective on why you cannot fall asleep even
            when you feel exhausted, and arming you with easy-to-use mindfulness
            meditation exercises, <b>Buddha’s Book of Sleep </b>will help you
            calm your hurried thoughts, and go from feeling always sleepy to
            getting the rest you need.

            Visionary Resources)</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />"Emet's book serves also as a fine introduction to
          the Buddha's teachings, as well as to their application to the art of
          sleeping well. Readers may come to it attracted by its primary
          purpose. If they read attentively and follow the program of exercises
          with due patience, they will come away not only with changed sleeping
          habits, but changed lives."<br /><b
            >—Peter Clothier, Huffington Post</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br /><b>“</b>This small volume is based on his 15 years
          of teaching experience and the many questions and conversations with
          followers. It contains well-written prose for use as an exercise to
          coax the mind into calmness.”<br /><b>—South China Morning Post</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br /><b>“</b>In this gift-sized, get-to-the-point book,
          Emet quickly moves the reader from “busy mind” into concentration,
          meditation, and contentment. The book is practical, easy to read, and
          realistic in its approach. Emet’s tone is comfortable and
          encouraging.”<br /><b>—Retailing Insight</b><br />&nbsp;<br />“<i
            ><b>Buddha's Book of Sleep</b></i
          >&nbsp;is the first book to treat sleep disorders from the perspective
          of mindfulness meditation. Supplying readers with a new perspective on
          why they cannot fall asleep (even when they feel exhausted), and
          arming them with easy-to-use tools from the practices of mindfulness
          meditation,&nbsp;<i><b>Buddha's Book of Sleep</b></i
          >&nbsp;will help the reader calm their hurried thoughts and rest
          easy.”<br /><b>—The Best You</b><br />&nbsp;<br />“This calming,
          mind-freeing book will teach you to awaken to mindfulness, thereby
          letting go of troubling patterns that prevent sleep. Words of wisdom,
          peaceful thoughts, and a seven week programme of Buddhist meditation
          and exercise will help&nbsp; you to do just that! A lovely book, which
          would also make a great gift for the insomniac in your life!”<br /><b

          ><br />&nbsp;<br />"Perhaps the most appealing thought in this
