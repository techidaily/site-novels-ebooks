            >DISCOVER YOUR PSYCHIC ABILITIES AS YOU READ JOHN’S FASCINATING
            STORY<br /></b
          ><br />In <i>Born Knowing</i>, psychic John Holland explains in his
          open and candid way how he dealt with his conflict by coming to terms
          with, and finally accepting, his rare ability as a spirit messenger
          who helps people connect with those who have passed on.<br /><br />Born
          in the tough suburbs of Boston, John coped with a difficult childhood,
          where he was ridiculed by his family and society, leaving him feeling
          isolated because of his psychic abilities. He refused to acknowledge
          his gift until a near-fatal automobile accident amplified his skills
          to the point that he had to learn how to control what was once pushed
          away.<br /><br />Drawn by the history and knowledge of spiritualism in
          England, John went on a two-year journey throughout Great Britain. He
          tells the story of his training in the British spiritualist
          organizations and his time at Arthur Findlay College, an institution
          for psychic studies that John refers to humorously as “Spirit Boot
          Camp.”&nbsp;He goes on to explain how he gained acceptance and respect
          within this tightly knit, often-conservative spiritual community.
          <br /><br />Throughout <i>Born Knowing</i>, John presents real-life
          case studies where he discusses his readings with clients, the effect
          on their lives, and the sense of closure people feel, knowing that
          their loved ones who have passed on are still with them.<br /><br />The
          book will also help you discover and develop your own psychic and
          intuitive abilities, recognize signals from the Other Side, and make
          spiritual connections for yourself.

        </h4>
        <p>
          John Holland, internationally renowned psychic medium, has been
          lecturing, teaching, demonstrating, and reading for private clients
          for over 20 years. He believes passionately that once the physical
          body dies, our spirit lives on. He’s dedicated his life to his own
          spiritual development and teaching others how to connect with Spirit,
          as well as offering peace and comfort during times of loss and
          bereavement. He continues to push the boundaries of authentic
          mediumship by developing an even higher awareness of Spirit. The
          best-selling author of Born Knowing, Psychic Navigator, 101 Ways to
          Jump-Start Your Intuition, Power of the Soul, The Psychic Tarot Oracle
          Deck, and The Spirit Whisperer, John also hosts his own weekly radio
          show, Spirit Connections. He has become a familiar face on television
          in shows such as the A&amp;E special Mediums: We See Dead People, as
          well as becoming a psychic authority on the History Channel’s Psychic
          History. Website: www.JohnHolland.com
