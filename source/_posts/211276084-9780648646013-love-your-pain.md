            What did I do to deserve this? Why is this happening to me? Why do
            bad things happen to good people? These are questions that
            thoughtful people have been asking since the beginning of time. In
            this, easy to understand, book Laurence is presenting a perspective
            that draws on science, Theosophy, Astrology and more to provide a
            unique and satisfying answer.

            As Einstein said: "Make it as simple as possible, but not simpler."
            Using stories to illustrate the concepts Laurence has made this
            concept as simple as possible and highly readable.

          "I read a lot of self-help books and Laurence's perspective is unique.
          His combination of spirituality and physics, illustrated by stories,
          has enabled me to see the world very differently. I still ask
          questions about pain and "bad things", but now I am much more at peace
          with the experience. This is a life-changing book."

          "Laurence has presented his wisdom in a very compassionate, cheerful
          and optimistic way with loving and well told stories. This is an
          important book to read."

          "As a trained obstetrician and gynaecologist, the most powerful part
          of the book for me was reading the example of the woman giving birth.
          This was a golden nugget!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found the graphs with spiritual and material concerns powerful
          and the diagram outlining the various influences and factors that make
          us who we are. I am Natasha and the essence of who I am is made up of
          my parents and their history/ experiences. Soon after reading this
          book, I saw Henry Winkler (the Fonz from Happy Days) speak. He spoke
          of how his Thought Forms and patterns have been heavily influenced by
          his parents who fled Nazi Germany. The Fonz I reckon would resonate
          very much with Laurence's book too."
