            Telepathy, clairvoyance, ESP . . . in these ten chapters, leading
            parapsychologists and philosophers explore experiences that
            challenge the modern scientific worldview—a worldview that has
            brought us to a state of planetary crisis. It is imperative that our
            thinking about perception and experience be outside the box—in this
            case, outside the Western commitment to a materialistic,
            mechanistic, atheistic metaphysics. The alternative offered by
            philosopher Alfred North Whitehead is a view more congenial not only
            to extraordinary experience, but to the current state of scientific
            research, which has revealed that activity, selection, and response
            are facets of every level of reality from the quantum event to the
            neural cell.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The area of scientific research that challenges the modern paradigm
            most head-on is parapsychology, which has for decades churned out
            careful study after study supporting the existence of extrasensory
            perception, especially telepathy, clairvoyance, and psychokinesis.
            The reasons why this research has been doubted, challenged, and
            sometimes vilified are several, but underlying all of them are
            certain philosophical and, surprisingly, theological choices made
            about the nature of reality during the formative period of the
            scientific endeavor. Descartes’ mind/matter metaphysics on the
            philosophical side, and the denial of action at a distance—partly in
            order to preserve the unique quality of Christian miracles—on the
            religious side, still haunt the foundations of modern science, even
            though “mind” (and God) have been exorcised, while action at a
            distance remains a shrouded constant in scientific theory (e.g.,
            gravity and electromagnetic attraction).
          </p>
          <p>
            Transpersonal psychology, which studies all types of extraordinary
            experience—mystical, psychedelic, near-death, out-of-body, and
            psychical—presents an even greater challenge to the modern
            paradigm’s materialist-mechanical worldview: the notion that the
            universe is composed solely of bits of inert, insentient matter in
            motion. While the phenomena studied by transpersonal psychology
            offer more dramatic anomalies for the modern paradigm, especially in
            its most recent atheistic incarnation, the phenomena researched by
            parapsychology are far more amenable to experimental investigation
            and thus present a challenge on science’s home turf. This may also
            help account for the vehement reactions often elicited by the mere
            mention of parapsychology as a credible science.

          This book proposes an “ecological civilization,” one that reflects the
          impending climate changes of the twenty-first century. In recent years
          there has been a plethora of books and articles on this topic. What is
          new about this volume is its link to exceptional human experiences,
          especially those anomalies that cannot be easily reconciled with
          mainstream science’s understanding of time, space, and energy. The
          extraordinary suggestion of the chapter authors is that the concepts
          and data from transpersonal psychology and parapsychology, long
          rejected, ridiculed, or ignored by mainstream science, are the very
          resources needed to reorient this endangered world and its tattered
          societies. ~ Stanley Kripper, From the Foreword<br />"The
          reductionistic methods of modern materialism work well when it comes
          to explaining the operation of pendulum clocks and combustion engines.
          But when it comes to consciousness, reductionism comes up stunningly
          short. The materialistic picture of the universe simply leaves
          consciousness out, relegating it to the status of an improbable
          anomaly But students of Alfred North Whitehead’s organic philosophy
          know what is required to give consciousness its proper place in the
          universe. As these authors show, once we have fully inhabited
          Whitehead’s creative and enchanted vision of the cosmos, what at first
          seemed parapsychological in the context of a mechanistic universe may
          turn out to be entirely normal features of a now Whiteheadian
          psychology. ~Matthew T. Segall, Professor, California Institute of
          Integral Studies
