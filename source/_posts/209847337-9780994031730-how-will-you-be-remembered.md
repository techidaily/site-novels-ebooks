            Millions of people are learning about their ancestry from DNA tests.
            What ancient blood flows in us? Where did our ancestors come from?
            We may discover our origins, but we won’t hear our ancestors’
            stories. We’ll learn little about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, to the future. Your descendants will be just as curious about
            the past as you are now. You can give them an enduring gift –
            stories about your life, your family’s life, and the legacies you
            created. Decades from now, your stories (shared in print, audio or
            video) will live on. Your descendants will say “Thank you. We’re
            proud to know who you were and where we came from.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Your legacies and their stories have nothing to do with money or the
            end of your days. They’re about connection, meaning and joy –
            now!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In this entertaining book, journalist and producer Robb Lucy
            explains how to create hundreds of personal stories to share with
            others. Lucy is passionate about sharing this message: “Don’t let
            your legacy stories disappear!”
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>How Will You be Remembered?</strong> is for anyone who has
            asked: Will I make a difference? Are my stories worth telling? Do I
            want to leave a mark and enjoy it now? With wit, logic and clarity,
            Lucy shows how to create legacies and stories that will enrich your
            life and the lives of those around you.
          </p>
          <p>
            How will you be remembered? With love today… and with admiration in
            the future.
