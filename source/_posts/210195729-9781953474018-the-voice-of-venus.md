            Clairvoyantly and clairaudiently received through Ernest L. Norman
            (1904â€’1971), The Voice of Venus,
            <strong>Book One of the five-volume Pulse of Creation series</strong
            >, was first published in 1956 and remains a popular favorite among
            his seventeen published works. The complete series features
            dissertations from the Ascended Masters who introduce a "universal,
            articulate, interdimensional understanding of science"-<strong
              >a cosmic "theory of everything"</strong
            >
            that joins science and spirit into a useful guide for visionary
            leaders in the arts, science, healing, education, leadership,
            devotion, and philosophy.

            guides. Generations of readers have exclaimed over the spiritual
            awakening the book inspired. Many claim the book never loses its
            luster, even after countless re-visits:

          <p>
            "The Voice of Venus is like a celestial passport to the Inner Worlds
            of Light. I love to visit the crystalline cities with their
            classrooms, healing temples, and beautiful gardens, while taking in
            the higher energies radiated from the Venusians. After reading, I
            always feel more love, peace, and joy!"-Jennifer Stovall
          </p>
          <p>
            "The information that is contained in the five-volume set has been
            my source of inspiration for the past thirty-five plus years."
            -Michael L., Inventor
          </p>
          <p>
            "I always wondered about life after death and what the experience of
            dying would be like. This book takes you through the process in a
            way that is unique and exquisitely explained. The scientific and
            spiritual blend of knowledge is beautiful beyond anything I have
            ever read-or experienced!"-Douglas Taylor, Artist, Author of Soulic
