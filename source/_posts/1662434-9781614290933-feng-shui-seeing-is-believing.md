          In this pithy and practical handbook, Ven. Jampa Ludrup lays out the
          fundamentals of feng shui without any of the opaque mysticism that
          sometimes clouds the practice. "The aim of this book," he writes, "is
          to help you have more happiness in your life." Through his
          easy-to-understand instructions, diagrams, and photos, Ludrup
          illustrates how simple alterations to the layout of your home can
          vastly improve specific areas of your life-romance, prosperity,
          health, or whatever is troubling you. With nothing more than this book
          and a good compass, you can rearrange your house, your fortune, and
          your life.<br />
          <br />The book comes with a handy pocket-sized chart that you can
          carry with you to job interviews or first dates - any important events
          - so that you can be confident that you will be able to achieve the
          best possible outcome.

        <p>
          In 1996 Ven. Jampa Ludrup was an attendant to Ven. Lama Zopa Rinpoche
          during his tour of Nepal, India, Singapore, and Malaysia. At this time
          Lama Zopa made his first contact with feng shui Grand Master Yap Cheng
          Hai and world-renowned expert and prolific author Lillian Too. With
          Lama Zopa's encouragement, Ven. Jampa made a study of their system of
          feng shui and after personal experiment he started to give advice and
          consultations. From 1998 he has been resident at Sera Je Monastic
          University in South India where he has studied Buddhism as well as
          serving as English language studies tutor to Ven. Lama Osel Rinpoche
          from 1998 to 2003. Since 2003 he has been much in demand, and has
          given feng shui courses and consultancy to many businesses,
          institutions, and individuals all across the globe. In 2012 he made
          his tenth world tour. You may contact him at www.jlgeomancy.com.<br />
          <br />Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche is the Spiritual Director of the
          Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition (FPMT), a
          worldwide network of Buddhist centers, monasteries, and affiliated
          projects, including Wisdom Publications. Rinpoche was born in 1946 in
          the village of Thami in the Solo Khumbu region of Nepal near Mount
          Everest. His books include
          <i>Transforming Problems into Happiness, How to Be Happy</i>, and
          <i>Ultimate Healing</i>. He lives in Aptos, California.
