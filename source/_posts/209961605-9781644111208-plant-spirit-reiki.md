          Enrich your Reiki practice by connecting with the healing spirit of
          plants and the natural world <br /><br />• Explores a new way of
          channeling Reiki energy for both personal healing and professional
          practice by intuitively connecting with plants and the natural world
          <br /><br />• Provides simple exercises, meditations, and Reiki
          practices to help the reader intuitively work in partnership with
          plants as part of their Reiki practice <br /><br />• Emphasizes
          healing exchange with plants and the self-practice of Reiki in
          partnership with the spirit of plants to heal our essential nature
          <br /><br />• Explains how to raise the vibration of your community
          and the world by connecting with green spaces, nature beings, and
          habitats under threat <br /><br />In this practical workbook, Fay
          Johnstone demonstrates how energy healers and Reiki practitioners can
          partner with plant spirit allies and the forces of nature for powerful
          healing for themselves, others, and our planet. She explains how to
          include plants and nature in your Reiki practice, both the
          spiritual/etheric components of plants and the physical plants
          themselves. She offers many practical exercises, techniques, and
          meditations as well as case studies and personal experiences to show
          how best to harness the power of plants on all levels, along with
          other energy flows, to support the healing process in much the same
          way that crystals are used as energetic healing aids. She explains how
          plants connect with the Reiki principles and explores plant spirit
          allies, chakra work, and healing with the elements of nature. She
          details how to enhance self-healing and Reiki treatments for others
          through “bringing the outside in,” creating a healing space, use of
          plant preparations, and other sacred forms of plant medicine.
          <br /><br />Fay also explores how to support the healing of plants and
          nature itself through your Reiki/healing practice. She provides
          guidance on how to raise the vibration of your home and community, how
          to impact nature positively with regard to climate change, and how to
          send distance healing to the Earth, nature beings, and endangered
          habitats across the world. She inspires you to reach out to the vital
          force that flows through the natural world and open your intuition to
          discover guidance and support from nature. By deepening our conscious
          cooperation and partnership with nature and the plant kingdom, in a
          sacred healing way, we come to recognize that in healing ourselves, we
          are also healing our Earth.
