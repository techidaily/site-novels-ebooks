            <i>Best Tarot Practices</i> is a comprehensive approach to teaching
            everything you need to know to read the cards for personal insight
            and spiritual growth, for yourself and others. Using a method that
            blends modern questions and answers with innovative exercises and
            encourages intuition, Masino empowers the reader to find their own
            private connection with each of the cards, fostering a lasting and
            deeply personal relationship with the characters and symbols within
            the deck. Unlike many other beginning tarot books,
            <i>Best Tarot Practices</i> focuses not just on how to read the
            cards, but also on how to become a successful tarot
            reader--including how to handle difficult questions and messages in
            a reading, how to deal with needy, greedy, or superstitious seekers,
            and how to make each reading accurate and personal for the seeker.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Best Tarot Practices</i> offers a step-by-step approach to
            understanding the tarot, from the four suits and the court cards to
            the Major Arcana to learning new spreads that offer guidance in
            becoming your own tarot master. <i>Best Tarot Practices</i> teaches
            readers how to trust what they already know and how to share that
            knowledge by reading the cards for others.
