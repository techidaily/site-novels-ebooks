            There is a golden thread that runs through every religion in the
            world. There is a golden thread that runs through the lives and the
            teachings of all the prophets, seers, sages, and saviours in the
            world's history, through the lives of all men and women of truly
            great and lasting power. All that they have ever done or attained to
            has been done in full accordance with law. What one has done, all
            may do.
          </p>
          <p>
            This same golden thread must enter into the lives of all who today,
            in this busy work-a-day world of ours, would exchange impotence for
            power, weakness and suffering for abounding health and strength,
            pain and unrest for perfect peace, poverty of whatever nature for
            fullness and plenty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each is building his own world. We both build from within and we
            attract from without. Thought is the force with which we build, for
            thoughts are forces. Like builds like and like attracts like. In the
            degree that thought is spiritualized does it become more subtle and
            powerful in its workings. This spiritualizing is in accordance with
            law and is within the power of all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything is first worked out in the unseen before it is manifested
            in the seen, in the ideal before it is realized in the real, in the
            spiritual before it shows forth in the material. The realm of the
            unseen is the realm of cause. The realm of the seen is the realm of
            effect. The nature of effect is always determined and conditioned by
            the nature of its cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            To point out the great facts in connection with, and the great laws
            underlying the workings of the interior, spiritual, thought forces,
            to point them out so simply and so clearly that even a child can
            understand, is the author's aim. To point them out so simply and so
            clearly that all can grasp them, that all can take them and infuse
            them into every-day life, so as to mould it in all its details in
            accordance with what they would have it, is his purpose. That life
            can be thus moulded by them is not a matter of mere speculation or
            theory with him, but a matter of positive knowledge.

            There is a divine sequence running throughout the universe. Within
            and above and below the human will incessantly works the Divine
            will. To come into harmony with it and thereby with all the higher
            laws and forces, to come then into league and to work in conjunction
            with them, in order that they can work in league and in conjunction
            with us, is to come into the chain of this wonderful sequence. This
            is the secret of all success. This is to come into the possession of
            unknown riches, into the realization of undreamed-of powers.
