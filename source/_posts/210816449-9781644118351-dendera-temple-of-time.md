            >A full-color exploration of the encoded ceiling at the Temple of
            Dendera</b
          ><br /><br />• Draws on more than 5,000 high-resolution photographs
          taken by the author to reconstruct the complete ceiling of the portico
          of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera<br /><br />• Reveals in detail how
          each panel represents celestial cycles of time from the Precession of
          the Equinoxes to the annual cycles of life found along the Nile<br /><br />•
          Explains each panel’s astronomical significance from the ancient
          Egyptian perspective as well as examining the myths, gods, and
          goddesses depicted<br /><br />Egypt is famous for its pyramids, the
          Sphinx, the temples at Luxor, and the Valley of the Kings, but 40
          miles north of Luxor lies the best-preserved temple complex in all of
          Egypt: The Temple of Dendera, known for the famous “Zodiac of Dendera”
          now housed in the Louvre Museum. Within the portico leading into the
          Hathor temple at Dendera is a little-known outstanding achievement of
          humanity: an extensive colored bas-relief—larger than the ceiling of
          the Sistine Chapel—meticulously encoded with the sophisticated
          astronomical knowledge of ancient Egypt.<br /><br />Drawing on more
          than 5,000 high-resolution photographs he has taken at the Temple of
          Dendera, photographer and computer scientist José María Barrera
          presents a complete full-color photographic reconstruction of the
          ceiling of the pronaos at Dendera and reveals in detail how each panel
          represents celestial cycles of time from the precession of the
          equinoxes to the annual cycles of life found along the Nile. He
          explains the meaning of the layout of the ceiling as it relates to the
          present, the past, eternity, the hours of the day, the phases of the
          moon, the constellations used in ancient Egyptian astronomy, the solar
          year, and the Great Year. The author provides detailed analysis of
          each panel, including close-up photos, and explains each panel’s
          astronomical and spiritual significance from the ancient Egyptian
          perspective as well as examining the myths, gods, and goddesses
          depicted. He also includes an appendix exploring the meaning and
          symbology of ancient Egyptian iconography.<br /><br />Allowing you to
          experience the vivid details of this ancient work of art and science,
          this photographic exploration also re-creates the sense of spiritual
          awe and power the Temple of Dendera radiates to its visitors, whether
          today or millennia ago.
