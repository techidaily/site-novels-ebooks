          A radical reinterpretation of the relationship of Judas and Jesus
          <br /><br />• Reexamines the role and the purpose the key figure of
          Judas played in the crucifixion story <br /><br />• Reveals how Judas
          was “betrayed” by Jesus, and how, taken to the limits of his humanity,
          he lost everything he most cherished on the path to his true self
          <br /><br />The familiar story of Judas, betrayer of Jesus, is
          striking because of its incomprehensibility. Why would one of Christ’s
          disciples and companions of the heart deliver him up to his enemies
          and a barbarous, ignominious, and certain death for thirty pieces of
          silver? Jean-Yves Leloup’s careful investigation of the gospels,
          various apocryphal texts, and most importantly the Coptic codex known
          as the Gospel of Judas, leads him to conclude that there is more to
          the familiar story of Judas than a simple demonstration, viewed
          through one man, of humanity’s inherent failings. <br /><br />The
          betrayal of Jesus to the Romans was Jesus’s idea, explains Leloup.
          Jesus persuaded Judas to play the role of “evil” in humankind by
          telling him that this enactment was crucial to God’s plan and would
          set Judas by Jesus’s side for eternity: “There where I am,” spoke
          Jesus to Judas, “is where I wish you, too, to be.” <br /><br />But to
          get there, Judas--a metaphorical representation of the darker side
          present in all human beings and the “shadow” counterpart to his
          Messiah dying on the cross-- must first shed all his human qualities.
          His failings of greed, deceit, and cowardice--and even his faith and
          hope--are washed away in the despair that engulfs him. A parallel
          moment occurs for Jesus on the cross, when he comes to know the
          despair of separation from God. The moment Judas “loses” his life and
          all that gave it meaning--his God, his law, his justice, his
          Messiah--is the very moment he finds that which cannot be
          discarded--life eternal. Thus, in the moment of his ultimate
          extremity, Judas receives Jesus’s true message and his intended gift.

          Judas as essential to the mission of Jesus, and as such, within each
