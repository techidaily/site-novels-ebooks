            >In her third and most important work, Juliet Diaz, the bestselling
            author of Witchery, offers an approach to Magic, spirituality, and
            healing like no other and takes readers through the deep work of
            decolonizing their spirituality.</b
          ><br /><br />The Altar Within: A Radical Devotional to Liberate the
          Divine Self&nbsp;is a work of spiritual revolution for all peoples,
          offering them practices and rituals in the arts of self-worship,
          self-discovery, and self-activism.&nbsp;The Altar Within&nbsp;is like
          no other approach to Spirituality, breaking through the vicious cycles
          of harmful and toxic spiritual practices and beliefs. Diaz speaks for
          those victimized and enslaved by colonization and offers a new take on
          personal development based in the resounding plea of our ancestors to
          live our Divined lives, the ones they could not have for
          themselves.<br />
          <br />
          In the book, Diaz leads the reader through an exploration of:<br />
          <br />&nbsp;<br />
          Self-Worship:&nbsp;Here, the reader comes to ritualize the experiences
          of self-compassion, mindfulness, self-acceptance, and radical
          self-honesty, creating practices that help them to see their Divinity
          and Altar within. Through these rites, readers will have a better
          understanding of what it means to decolonize their Spirituality,
          giving birth to new spiritual practices while honoring the experiences
          of our ancestors. Dismantling the idea that Divinity must only exist
          from without, Diaz takes readers on a journey of powerful
          Self-Worship, connecting them into the Divinity that resides within
          all of us. Self-Discovery:&nbsp;In this section, Diaz helps the reader
          to discover their Divined lives, but in a way that most teachers
          haven't offered. As Diaz shares, it isn't through our achievements
          that we find our purpose but through understanding the Divine self.
          Here, Diaz leads readers through practices in self-love,
          self-patience, and self-forgiveness, helping them to experience the
          stillness and wholeness needed to hear the messages shared by the
          Divine. Self-Activism:&nbsp;Unlike traditional manifestation teachers,
          Diaz recognizes that manifestations are not brought forth by
          #goodvibesonly but by a real and committed process of activism,
          standing in our deep worth and sharing our humanity. In this section,
          Diaz offers a series of Devotionals to guide readers in the practice
          of Community Care, connecting the work not only with the Magic of
          manifestation but with our communities, our ancestors, and the Divine
          Self within. <br />Pushing back on #lightandlove and #goodvibesonly,
          Diaz dismantles the wellness industry, releasing readers from the
          practice of spiritual bypassing into a far more powerful experience of
          self, healing, hope, and Spirit. This book is for anyone, including
          those who can't afford to buy all the tools, pay for the expensive
          memberships, people who have real-life issues, illnesses, and
          hardships. Through&nbsp;The Altar Within, Diaz brings the Magic to
          real life, acknowledging our humanness by connecting with our
          Spirit.&nbsp;<br />
          <br />
          The Altar Within&nbsp;will help readers create success in every area
          of their lives—from wealth, health, relationships, and personal
          development, to the nourishment of their relationship with the Divine
          self. As Diaz explains, when we can finally decolonize our spiritual
          beliefs, Divinity can be a super force in our lives, making us whole,
          stronger, wiser, and setting us on a path of transcendent activism.
