          The first in the How Life Works series, How Generosity Works is based
          on the best-selling book How Yoga Works. Like the tale told in How
          Yoga Works, which is pinned to Master Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, How
          Generosity Works is drawn from Master Shantideva’s teachings contained
          in A Guide to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life.<br /><br />Part
          instruction and part short story, this book illustrates how one can
          use the transformational power of Master Shantideva’s teachings to
          create a happier life for oneself and for others. Set in a small New
          England town, a connection is formed between Grace, a middle-aged
          Buddhist practitioner, and Troy. Still grieving the death of his good
          friend, a breakup with his girlfriend, and the fallout of his parents’
          divorce, Troy has returned home after failing too many classes in
          college. At his father’s house, he endures the unwelcoming scorn from
          a combative and critical stepmother. Their initial connection through
          music sets the space for the deeper teachings of Master Shantideva’s
          verses. In a touching story that empowers Troy to take control of his
          own life, this story demonstrates how to transform pain into a
          profound experience of love.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Janet Kathleen Ettele is a musician and author who draws from her
          background as a student of Buddhist dharma to bring its teachings into
          contemporary practice through her writing and her music. Two CDs,
          Piano Mandalas and Piano Mandalas—Compassion, are collections of her
          meditatively improvised music. Her first introduction to meditation
          came while attending a Quaker boarding school. Decades later, she
          realized this aspect of her education had provided the perfect
          foundation for much that was to follow. She graduated from Berklee
          College of Music in Boston and worked in the entertainment industry
          until becoming a mother. She lives in Connecticut, where she has
          raised two sons. Ettele has written poetry and motivational articles;
          How Generosity Works is her first writing of fiction.
