            >A revolutionary expert in energy medicine and alternative therapies
            “offers interesting and fresh insight into the dynamics of healing”
            (Deepak&nbsp;Chopra, M.D., author of&nbsp;</b
          ><i><b>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</b></i
          ><b>)<br /></b><br />
          Why are prominent doctors and medical researchers all over the world
          interested in the extraordinary&nbsp;healings&nbsp;reported by the
          patients of Dr. Eric Pearl? What does it mean when these patients
          report the sudden disappearance of afflictions such as cancer, AIDS,
          and cerebral palsy? And what does it mean when people who interact
          with Dr. Pearl report a sudden ability to access this healing energy
          not just for themselves—but for others, too? What is this
          phenomenon?<br /><br />
          Well, you might have to reconsider everything you’ve read up until now
          about conventional healing. The new frequencies of healing described
          by Dr. Pearl transcend technique entirely and bring you to levels
          beyond those previously accessible to anyone, anywhere. This book
          takes you on Eric Pearl’s journey from the discovery of his ability to
          heal, to his well-deserved reputation as the instrument through which
          this process is being introduced to the world. But most
          important,&nbsp;<i>The&nbsp;Reconnection</i>&nbsp;reveals methods you
          can use to personally master these new healing energies.

          “Reconnecting to Source is the secret to all healing. Eric explains
          how to do this as well as anyone I’ve read.”<br /><b
            >—Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</b
          >, bestselling author of <i>Ask and It Is Given</i> and
          <i>Change Your Thoughts, Change Your Life</i><br /><br />“Eric is an
          amazing man with the superb gift of healing. Read this book and be
          transformed!”<br /><b>—John Edward</b>,&nbsp;psychic medium and author
          of <i>Crossing Over</i> and <i>After Life</i><br /><br />“When I first
          received <i>The Reconnection</i>,&nbsp;I sat down and read it cover to
          cover in one evening. I was enthralled. It reads like a goodnovel.
          But, unlike a novel, this book is the truth—the truth about a
          revolutionary new way to heal and be healed that is available to
          anyone.&nbsp;Filled with humor, insight, and the in-depth
          understanding and humility that come only with the maturity of a good
          clinician and scientist, Eric Pearl tells the story of how he became
          transformed by reconnective&nbsp;energy, and how all of us can do the
          same. If you’re serious about health and healing, read this
          book!”&nbsp;<br /><b>—Christiane Northrup, M.D.</b>, assistant
          clinical professor of&nbsp;OB/GYN at the University of Vermont College
          of Medicine and author of <i>Women’s Bodies</i>, <i>Women’s Wisdom</i
          ><br /><br />“As a physician and a neuro-scientist, I have been
          trained to know why and how a treatment works. When it comes to
          Reconnective Healing, I don’t know how it works. I simply know from
          personal experience that it does. Eric Pearl’s work has been a great
          gift for me, and through this book, can be the same for you.”<br /><b
            >—Mona Lisa Schulz, M.D.</b
          >, Ph.D.,&nbsp;author of <i>The Intuitive Advisor</i
          ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />“Many have been waiting decades for
          what Dr. Eric Pearl has given us in his first book—a new, unique, and
          elegant way of teaching healing and transformation. The true
          revelation of his work, however, is that he is giving the secrets
          away! Not only is this book fun to read, but this intently funny and
          curious healer really shows the ease in which true energy healing can
          be recognized and activated within all of us. It’s about time!”<br /><b

          >
          author of the Kryon books and co-author of <i>The Indigo Children</i
          ><br /><br />“Dr. Eric Pearl’s <i>The Reconnection</i> is quite simply
          the best book on&nbsp;transpersonal healing and spirit medicine to
          appear in years. It is a gift&nbsp;from the Universe and an
          extraordinarily exciting contribution to the&nbsp;worldwide paradigm
          shift occurring in our time. If you read only two&nbsp;books this
          year, make sure that this jewel is one of them.”<br /><b

          >,&nbsp;author of <i>Spiritwalker, Medicinemaker,</i> and
          <i>Visionseeker</i><br /><br />“Eric has written a wonderful,
          thought-provoking, and practical bookon healing. He shares not only
          his personal insights and experiences&nbsp;with the grace of healing,
          he also gives useful techniques to bring about&nbsp;the healings we
          all need in our lives—not only for ourselves, but for others. Eric’s
          humor and sincerity make this book a MUST-READ.”<br />—<b

          as it comforts the heart and celebrates the healing process. Dr.
          Pearl’s vision of Reconnective Healing&nbsp;should be read by
          health-care professionals who wish to foster a higherlevel of healing
          in their patients and, in the process, heal themselves.
          <i>The Reconnection</i> should also be read by patients so they can
          not only&nbsp;heal themselves, but assist in the healing of
          others—and, through their&nbsp;example, they can inform their
          conventional physicians about contemporary energy medicine and the
          healing power of The Reconnection.”&nbsp;<br /><b

          ><br />“This is a wonderful book describing the evolution of a
          doctor-healer,&nbsp;told with wit, humor, and deep insights. Dr.
          Pearl’s unique stories and experiences leading to the development of
          Reconnective Healing are both inspirational and moving. Eric Pearl has
          been given an unparalleled gift of healing, which he passes on to the
          rest of us. His approach to Reconnective Healing is simple, yet
          profound in itseffects. It represents a new, nondirected form of
          energetic healing that goes beyond the formulas, techniques, and
          mantras that we havehad to work with on this planet until now. I
          highly recommend it for health-care practitioners, as well as anyone
          else interestedin awakening their own healing potential.”<br /><b

        <p>
          Dr. Eric Pearl walked away from one of the most successful
          chiropractic practices in Los Angeles when he and others started
          witnessing miraculous healings. Since that time, he has committed
          himself to imparting the light and information of the reconnective
          healing process through extensive lectures and seminars about The
          Reconnection.
