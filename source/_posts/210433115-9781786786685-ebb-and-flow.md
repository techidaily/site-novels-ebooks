          <b
            >An exploration of water's power to heal us, inspire us and offer us
            spiritual meaning. This is a feminist reimagining of the meaning of
            power through the lens of water. Easkey offers a range of wellness
            practices to encourage the reader to connect with water as healer,
            restoring a relationship of care.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Our strength lies in being soft like water.</i> This
          book is about the power we gain by connecting to water. It’s about how
          we can restore our relationship with the world's different bodies of
          water, and by doing so, restore both the water and ourselves. By
          sharing Easkey's own experiences as surfer and marine scientist, as
          well as those of many of her mentors who are at the forefront of water
          protection and activism around the world, it guides readers into
          reimagining the spirituality of water and restoring our innate
          connection with this lifeblood of the planet.<br /><br />The book also
          provides the reader with water-inspired strategies to restore calm,
          reduce stress and soothe anxiety. These range from simple breathing
          and visualization exercises to undertaking a journey from a water
          source to the ocean in order to forge a deep connection with the
          water. The emphasis is as much on the benefit to water as it is to the
          individual, and on creating a culture of reciprocity and care. By
          regaining this lost connection with water, we learn to develop an
          empathic connection with the force of all life and in the process
          restore our own hearts and minds.
