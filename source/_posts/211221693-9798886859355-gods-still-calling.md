          <p>his book is the life journey of a seventy-nine-year-old</p>
          <p>man who was asked by his grandchildren, “What did</p>
          <p>you do before you met Grandma?”</p>
          <p>He pondered the thought, intrigued by the</p>
          <p>question, and answered that he had done a thing or</p>
          <p>two they might be interested in: produced television</p>
          <p>programs, helped produce The Joy of Painting</p>
          <p>programs with Bob Ross, worked for President Nixon</p>
          <p>on a special project and with the woman who edited</p>
          <p>the original Jaws movie.</p>
          <p>When they sat there, eating dessert after</p>
          <p>Thanksgiving that day in 2017, their eyes rapt with</p>
          <p>attention, he fleshed out the stories a bit to see if they</p>
          <p>really were interested. They seemed to be, so he</p>
          <p>asked them, “If I wrote it down, would you read it?”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes, Grandpa,” they urged him. “Would you</p>
          <p>do that for us?”</p>
          <p>And that became the odyssey that is now this</p>
          <p>book. Grandpa Jim has been on television most of his</p>
          <p>
            life, tested his parents’ limits as a small child, fought with a
            skunk and lost,
          </p>
          <p>
            nearly lost his life several times by refusing to be an obedient
            child and
          </p>
          <p>
            driving too long multiple times when he was tired and going off the
            road.
          </p>
          <p>
            And as a nine-year-old, Jim and a friend dug a cave in a clay and
            sand
          </p>
          <p>
            field beside the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, switching
            yard near
          </p>
          <p>Chicago, where one day, the cave collapsed.</p>
          <p>
            Now, every time he sees his grandchildren, their plaintive cry is,
            “Are
          </p>
          <p>you finished with the book yet, Grandpa?”</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, he lived to tell the cave-in story. But his misbehavior
          </p>
          <p>
            isn’t the focus. His off-again, on-again journey with God is the
            story, with
          </p>
          <p>
            many adventures and misadventures along the way. As an adult who has
          </p>
          <p>
            recommitted his life to Christ, Jim has been a Young Life Leader, an
            Adult
          </p>
          <p>
            Sunday School teacher, a Mission Committee Chair, Mission Team
            Leader,
          </p>
          <p>
            television producer, talk-show host, mentor, and Teacher of the Year
            for
          </p>
          <p>
            the TCOM—now MEDIA Department at a Major University. Most of all,
          </p>
          <p>
            for over forty-seven years, he has been learning to see God’s
            fingerprints
          </p>
          <p>
            wherever he goes, and you will too. It is an adventure worth joining
            and
          </p>
          <p>one you will never, ever forget.</p>
