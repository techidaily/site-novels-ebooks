            THE ANGELS ARE COMING!<br /><br />You are not alone. Whatever
            obstacle or challenge you face, whatever threat or adversary looms
            before you, whatever ability you seek to gain or mountain of life
            you want to conquer, divine angelic help is ready to intervene on
            your behalf. When the unlimited power of magickal angels stand with
            you, obstacles become opportunities, low times become springboards
            for better days, relationships blossom, illness becomes wellness,
            challenges become victories and miracles happen!
          </p>
          <p>
            In Angels of Miracles and Manifestation, best-selling spiritual,
            magickal and paranormal author Embrosewyn Tazkuvel, reveals the
            secrets to summoning true magickal angels. And once called, how to
            use their awesome divine power to transform your compelling needs
            and desires into manifested reality.<br /><br />Angel magick is the
            oldest, most powerful and least understood of all methods of magick.
            Ancient books of scripture from multiple religions tell of the
            marvelous power and miracles of angels. But the secrets of the true
            angel names, who they really are, their hierarchy, their stewardship
            responsibilities, their sigils, and how to successfully call them
            and have them work their divine magick for you, was lost to the
            world as a large part of it descended into the dark ages.&nbsp;<br /><br />But
            a covenant was made by the Archangel Mae√°dael to the Adepts of
            Magick that as the people of the world evolved to a higher light the
            knowledge and power of angels would come again to the earth during
            the time of the Generation of Promise. That time is now. We are the
            Generation of Promise that has been foretold of for millennium. And
            all that was lost has been restored.<br /><br />It doesn't matter
            what religion or path of enlightenment and empowerment that you
            travel: Wicca, Christianity, Pagan, Jewish, Buddhist, Occult,
            Muslim, Kabbalah, Vedic, something else or none at all. Nor does
            your preferred system of magick from Enochian, Thelemic, Gardnerian,
            Hermetic, to Tantric matter. Once you know the true names of the
            mighty angels, their unique sigils, and the simple but specific way
            to summon them, they will come and they will help you.<br /><br />This
            revealing book of the ancient Celestine Light magick gives you
            immediate access to the divine powers of 14 Archangels, 136
            Stewardship Angels, and hundreds of Specialty Angels that serve
            beneath them. Whether you are a novice or a magickal Adept you will
            find that when angels are on your side you manifest results that you
            never imagined possible except in your dreams.&nbsp;<br /><br />The
            angel magick of Celestine Light is simple and direct without a lot
            of ritual, which makes it easy even for the novice to be able to
            quickly use it and gain benefit. While there is a place and
            importance to ritual in other types of magickal conjuring it is not
            necessary with angels. They are supernatural beings of unlimited
            power and awareness whose stewardship includes responding quickly to
            people in need who call upon them. You do not need elaborate rituals
            to get their attention.<br /><br />If you are ready to have magick
            come alive in your life; if you are ready for real-life practical
            results that bring wisdom, happiness, health, love and abundance; if
            you are ready to unveil your life's purpose and unleash your own
            great potential, obtain the treasure that is this book. Call upon
            the magickal angels and they will come. But be prepared. When you
            summon angels, the magick happens and it is transformative. Your
            life will improve in ways big and small. But it will never be the
            same.<br /><br />&nbsp;

          "An utterly fascinating read and master work.&nbsp;Many of the sigils
          are intricate in design. So intricate, the sigil for Abundance
          could&nbsp;be turned into a stainless steel, onyx and black pearl
          sculpture and put on display in the world's fine art museums."&nbsp;

          "I bought this book a few days ago, used one of the angel names and
          sigil exactly as the instructions indicated. Within hours, YES, I SAID
          WITHIN 3 or 4 HOURS, I got the best news regarding what I requested
          for. People, this stuff works! Be positive and trust the Angels to
          answer you and they will!&nbsp;You will definitely hear, see and read
          strange and uncommon things when you lean towards mysticism and
          spirituality so don't be deterred. Very very few people know the real
          thing. Follow your intuition. I followed mine, bought this book, got
          an instant result and will keep calling the Angels when the need
          arises. If one could give more than 5 stars, this book would have
          gotten it from me."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;~Mama

          "Another fantastic book by Embrosewyn Tazkuvel! This is just the sort
          of book I was hoping and praying would come from him one day. I am an
          Usui Reiki Master, but I almost always use a combination of Reiki
          symbols,&nbsp;Celestine Light Sigils and Words of Power in my healing
          sessions nowadays. I was so eager to learn more from him about the
          angels. Thank you Mr Tazkuvel. I have&nbsp;been a part of true blue
          miracles since discovering and implementing techniques I have learned
          from you. This book is pure gold. I have already begun using the angel
          sigils and signatures and have enjoyed fantastic results so far.&nbsp;

          "Life Changing!&nbsp;Literally every chapter is useful! I started
          working with the Angels and saw immediate, life changing results. I
          only wish I had this information earlier in life - so many difficult
          times could have been easier! Thank you Embrosewyn!&nbsp; &nbsp;~Shan

          "In this world of strife and sorrow, we all, at some point of our
          lives, have experienced incapacity, being helpless, useless and even
          suicidal when we cannot get at least, emotional support from our
          peers, friends or family members, when facing serious problems.

          For the first time, and in an easy&nbsp;way possible to anyone, we are
          offered immeasurable ways to face our life challenges and&nbsp;to
          resolve them. We get this from beings more loving, caring and powerful
          than any mortals. This book is to read, experience and see how your

          "A great and informative book!"&nbsp;I loved this book since I first
          turned page one. It's very informative with names and pronouncations
          of every angel to call in your time of need for just about every cause
          and reason imaginable listed.&nbsp; I have just begun to tap the full
          potential the book has to offer. It's one that will remain in use for
          a long time in my kindle library."&nbsp; &nbsp;~Matt Pepple~

          "Really glad I bought this book; goes into detail on how angels
          operate with gorgeous sigils and an angel for a majority of purposes.
          I highly recommend it."&nbsp; &nbsp;~That Guy~

          "This is the second of this authors books that I have used and it is
          at least as good as the first if not better and that is saying
          something.This is easy magick but it delivers big time no question
          about it.I love this authors work."&nbsp; &nbsp;~David Elliott~

        <p>
          "I LOVE this book. I bought this book and called several of the angels
          who assisted me with what I desired. Thank you so much Embrosewyn.
          There are many and I do mean MANY books on angelic help, angelic
          evocation, angelic rituals etc and I'm sure they serve their purpose,
          BUT this book is the real deal and I am grateful to add it to my
          collection.&nbsp; &nbsp;~Cici~.
