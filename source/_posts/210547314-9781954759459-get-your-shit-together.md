          <p>
            After years of searching to free herself of the emotional and
            psychologically damaging baggage she carried for so long, Amy Joy
            benefited from years of private and group coaching, from spiritual
            journeys, and from personal counseling. In participating in all
            these, Amy saw that she could provide her own unique experiences,
            insights, and tools to help others move ahead in their own journeys
            toward happiness and fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her own words, Amy's purpose for her book, Get Your Shit
            Together:
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have become happy and free in my life! And I want you to be happy
            and free, too. This book is a step-by-step guide in going from Fear
            to Freedom! Freedom from suffering, freedom from feeling helpless,
            and, instead, moving on to create and experience your own true
            freedom. My Mission is to liberate you from suffering and lead you
            into a life of freedom and joy, to a life you love!”
          </p>
          <p>
            In her book, Amy provides twelve chapters full of true stories, such
            as how she served as a missionary in the jungles of Papua New
            Guinea, how she escaped her dangerously abusive marriage, and how
            she helped save her precious friend Dani's life (who was stabbed
            nine times) — through a technique called the Diamond, which she
            teaches you how to use. Amy uses brief exercises in every chapter to
            teach you many spiritual techniques that will save you emotionally,
            physically, spiritually, and even financially.
