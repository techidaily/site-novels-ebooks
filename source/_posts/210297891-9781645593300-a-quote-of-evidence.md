            This book of quotes is written to encourage others. It is from the
            mind, soul, and within. Kelvin O. Parker started writing this book
            about twelve years ago while writing quotes for his students to
            encourage them. One class session, a student enjoyed it so much, he
            came to his desk and said, "Mr. Parker, you ought to write a book of
            quotes." So, he took out a piece of paper and started writing. His
            quotes each day were written from the student's personal experiences
            for that day and their lifetime. The author would ask his students
            what things they would like to express for the day, and they would
            give him a topic of the quote for the day.Thinking is a part of the
            natural human process. Every human has a left brain and a right
            brain from which the thinking process begins. Quotes come from this
            process. This book of quotes is sort of different from other book of
            quotes. The quotes come real-life experiences of the moment and the
            book describes why it was written. This book discusses several
            topics: Thoughts make or break, a boost of the person with thoughts,
            the effort of thoughts being positive, succeeding through thoughts,
            learning how your actions of thoughts may destroy your future,
            maintaining in life, evidence of change saving you, acceptance in
            life moving to success, forgiveness healing, potential making it
            work, self-worth making you or breaking you, and discouragement
            turned into a solution.Kelvin truly hopes that you are encouraged
            and inspired by reading his book, and you'll venture out today to
            encourage others.
