            Love Gratitude (1952) is a collection of two essays by Joel S.
            Goldsmith, a mystical teacher, spiritual healer, and writer.
            Goldsmith was the creator of a set of principles called "The
            Infinite Way," which taught that man's nature was to be one with God
            and to express His infinite power and love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joel S. Goldsmith (b. 1982, d. 1964) was born in New York City to
            non-practicing Jewish parents. He began his career as an apprentice
            in his father's import business, which gave him the opportunity to
            travel extensively. The great poverty and suffering that he
            encountered throughout the world, along with the horrors of war that
            he experienced as a Marine during World War I, set him on a search
            for universal truth. He began to study spiritual texts, including
            those of ancient Greece, Southeast Asia, and Aramaic-speaking
            cultures.
          </p>
          <p>
            While returning home from an international trip in the 1920s,
            Goldsmith contracted pneumonia on the ocean crossing. A Christian
            Science practitioner among the other passengers is said to have
            healed him. Soon after, Goldsmith found strangers approaching him on
            the street, asking for healing and prayer, which he was able to
            provide.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Goldsmith turned to the Christian Science Church for explanations
            about this new healing ability. He remained with the church for 16
            years but eventually grew disillusioned with organized religion.
            After leaving Christian Science, Goldsmith began writing his own
            thoughts and developing his spiritual philosophy. But even as his
            books grew in popularity, he resisted any attempts to organize his
            views into a formal religion, which he felt would obscure the
            original meaning of his spiritual message.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This work is a compilation of two of Goldsmith's essays, titled Love
            and Gratitude. Through seven short sections, Love explores how love
            flows around us and through us. We can "Open the avenues of Love
            through each other by not looking to each other for it but by
            looking to God for it."&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            When we expect something in return for an expression of love, we
            demonstrate only human love, a poor facsimile of the real thing. But
            when we expect no return for the outpouring of our love, when we
            accept that "whatever of Love you express is God expressing Itself
            and so you need not expect a return from it, from that time you
            enter an entirely new consciousness of life..."
          </p>
          <p>
            The second essay, Gratitude, teaches that gratitude, like love, is
            "God expressing Itself through man as man." Goldsmith argues that it
            is impossible to express gratitude "without expressing some degree
            of God while you are BEING grateful, for Gratitude is of God...not
            of man."
          </p>
          <p>
            We often think of gratitude as feeling appreciation for benefits or
            blessings. But as gratitude is not of man, "Gratitude is really a
            form of God activity or God expression. It is, therefore, true that
            ONLY God can express Love...ONLY God can express Gratitude. We can
            only be the vehicles through which God pours Itself as Love or as
            Gratitude."&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Gratitude is said to have been a divine message that was delivered
            directly to Goldsmith.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The principles taught in Love, Gratitude are part of Goldsmith's
            "Infinite Way," his spiritual and religious philosophy. While he
            wrote several books on the subject, there is still no organization
            or formal structure surrounding his teachings, in keeping with his
            wishes.
