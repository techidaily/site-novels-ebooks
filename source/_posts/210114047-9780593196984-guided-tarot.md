            >Your essential guide to reading tarot cards seamlessly--with
            confidence and ease</b
          ><br /><br />Each of us holds gifts deep within and, with tarot, we
          have the power to unlock those gifts and make transformative
          discoveries. For beginner tarot readers, learning the cards--all 78 of
          them--and understanding how to use spreads may seem daunting. Tarot
          expert Stefanie Caponi explains that interpreting the cards is a blend
          of knowing the card meanings, listening to your heart, and trusting
          your intuition. In her book, <i>Guided Tarot,</i>she offers easy
          exercises to nurture and grow your intuition, not only to understand
          the cards' universal meanings, but to channel your own meanings. This
          comprehensive guide also shows you how to attune your energy to the
          deck for more accurate readings. Soon you'll be confident in doing
          readings for yourself and even your friends.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          astrological, numerological, and elemental meanings, guidance for
          career, love, and spiritual life, and reverse card interpretations.
          <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;Beginner's tools&nbsp;offering step-by-step
          advice to prepare for and perform readings along with a variety of
          introductory spreads to try <br />&nbsp; •&nbsp;The Celtic Cross
          explained and deconstructed&nbsp;to help beginners master this popular
          spread with ease. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;•&nbsp;Quick reference

          "As a tarot teacher, I've often wished for a modern and concise tarot
          book to recommend to my students. Wish granted! I feel like the Nine
          of Cups! (Read the book and you'll get it.) <i>Guided Tarot </i>offers
          clear card meanings, engaging spreads, and no-nonsense esoteric
          advice. Stefanie Caponi's integrity and wisdom shine on every page, as
          she generously walks the reader into the world of tarot and
          intuition."

          ><br />
          “<i>Guided&nbsp;Tarot is</i> a thorough, interesting and fun read for
          beginners as well as seasoned professionals. She offers a bevy of
          tarot spreads as one familiarizes themselves with their new deck and
          cards. She also provides an empathic&nbsp;new spin on the traditional
          Rider-Waite interpretations. I highly recommend this book for all
          interested in tarot and astrology. Stefanie's insight and intuition
          will provide clarity and understanding so that you can whittle your
          tarot book collection to the essentials.”&nbsp;<b

          "Stefanie Caponi's <i>Guided Tarot</i> is an essential modern-day
          must-read for any tarot novice. Magnificently laid out and easy to
          digest, this book is a timeless comprehensive toolbox to hone in your
          intuition and engage a true catharsis from the magical wonders of
          tarot for healing, self-identity, and deep shadow work."
          <b>—Aurora Bee, <i>The Zine Witch </i>podcast<br /></b><br />
          “I had the honor of gathering with Stefanie in community through
          weekly tarot ritual, during which I grew to love Stefanie’s creative
          and natural approach to the tarot. In her new book, she generously
          weaves together her experiential wisdom into an intimate resource for
          the modern reader longing to deepen their intuitive gifts. I am beyond
          excited to add this book to my collection!”
