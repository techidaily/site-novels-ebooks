          "We are living in a time when many ancient, esoteric concepts of the
          East are being integrated into modern, Western life. It can be
          confusing! That is, until now. Along comes Tori Hartman with this
          precious gem of a book, to educate and demystify Chakras so you can
          work with your own. The wellbeing benefits of balancing and healing
          your chakras are enormous and now, with this information, easy to do!
          You’ll learn what gems, meditations, journaling exercise and even
          spices can help you access the transformative power of the chakras.
          And ultimately, you’ll learn more about yourself and that is a gift
          that will last a lifetime."<br /><br />—Kris Ferraro, Energy Coach,

          >"Tori’s fun and effortless read gives us a beautiful and
          comprehensive journey through the chakras.<br />Honoring eastern and

          with working with chakras, Tori provides a modern framework that gives
          the reader a deeply personal relationship with the chakra system, for
          wellness and transformation. An enjoyable and essential book to
          identify and work on imbalances, that would suit both practitioners
          and anyone interested in developing their knowledge of chakras for

        </h4>
        <p>
          Tori Hartman is a professional intuitive and author of the bestselling
          <i>Chakra Wisdom Oracles Cards</i>. Following a near-death experience
          almost 20 years ago, Tori was visited by a spirit who told her a
          collection of brightly colored stories. These stories prompted her
          life-long fascination with color, the chakras, and their power to
          transform and heal lives. Tori is based in Asheville, North Carolina.
