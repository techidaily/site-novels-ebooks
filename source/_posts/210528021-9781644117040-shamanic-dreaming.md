            >A journey through the three pathways of time--present, past, and
            future--to open yourself to shamanic visions</b
          ><br /><br />• Presents shamanic tools to help you prepare to receive
          visions, release the burdens of the past, and bring clarity to your
          visions of the future<br /><br />• Shares Earth Whispering practices
          to expand the senses, set intentions, and connect deeply with
          intuition and spirit helpers<br /><br />• Offers advice on working
          with guides and soul protectors as well as the different realms a
          guide might emerge from<br /><br />Visionaries dream the future into
          life, and throughout the ages shamans have served this role within
          their communities. Yet, how does one as an individual open to visions
          and allow the messages we need to hear to come through? Enter the
          stage of<i> Shamanic Dreaming</i> for a playful, evocative rendezvous
          with circle consciousness. <br /><br />In this shamanic guide,
          visionary Carol Day shows how to access our creative potential to
          shape a strong vision for ourselves and others, connecting intimately
          to the world around with the support of seen and unseen realms. Earth
          whispering practices prepare for shamanic visioning by expanding the
          senses; we open up to different dimensions and initiate a conscious
          relationship with nature, myth, and archetype through the creativity
          wheel. <br /><br />A time travel adventure through present, past, and
          future lands connects us with the ancestors and the future ones.
          Working with nature portals on the land and attuning with nature and
          animal guides, we visit the past to heal our ancestral lines. Visiting
          the future ones, we understand the importance of what we hold today in
          creating the environments and conditions of the future. Closing the
          circle to the present, our longing finds us ready to bring clarity to
          our own visions. Ingeniously crafted,
          <i>Shamanic Dreaming</i> provides us with all the practical skills
          needed for insightful visionary questing.
