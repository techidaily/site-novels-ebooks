          In 1987 Patricia Pereira started receiving telepathic communications
          from the star Arcturus and was requested to begin a series of
          galaxy-inspired manuscripts. <br />
          <br />
          The mission of this series of books is to awaken us to our individual
          and collective spiritual obligation for the health and well-being of
          our planet and all creatures who live upon her. <br />
          <br />
          Philosophical in scope, the essays in these books provide pragmatic,
          practical suggestions for emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual
          transformation. They remind readers of humans' relationships to the
          beings of light who inhabit the great star nations. The books are like
          cosmic flash cards: they can be opened and read at any part or in
          their entirety. <br />
          <br />
          Patricia Pereira was called to write through telepathic communications
          from the star Arcturus begins with the definitions of the sky
          warriors, also called "eagles of the new dawn." The book focuses on
          information regarding the Arcturians and their role with humans, earth
          as a planet seeded by stars, and humans as starseeds, and includes a
          fascinating rewrite of history featuring extraterrestrial involvement.
          The author's work encourages readers not to fear extraterrestrial
          contact, realize their telepathic ability, and awaken to proper
          stewardship of the earth.

        <p>
          For more than twenty years <b>Patricia Pereira</b> had been a
          down-to-earth medical transcriptionist. She was the founder of the
          Idaho chapter of the American Association for Medical Transcription.
          In 1985 her concern for the disappearance of endangered species on our
          planet drove her to start the well-known Wolf Recovery Foundation,
          which helped restore wolves in Yellowstone and Glacier national parks
          and in central Idaho.<br /><br />In 1987 Pereira's life changed
          dramatically. She began receiving telepathic communications from the
          star Arcturus and has transcribed thousands of pages that convey a
          message of hope and encouragement about the changes Earth will
          experience in the years to come. These galactically inspired pages
          have become the Arcturian Star Chronicles.<br /><br />When asked why
          she wanted to publish this series, Pereira says, "I wanted humanity to
          see there was hope for the future, the planet, and society, and that
          we have the ability and the technology to make the world a better
          place. <br /><br />"The main message the Arcturians want to
          communicate with us is that we must begin to acknowledge ourselves as
          spiritual beings and to know that it is up to us to make this planet a
          better place, in both our environment and our society. Our challenge
          is to live our lives with courage every day, knowing that what we do
          individually contributes to the planet as a whole."
