            >A mythological journey through 10 archetypes of psychedelic
            healing: ancient stories, tangible tools, and depth psychology
            insights</b
          ><br /><br />Designed for a new generation of psychedelic facilitators
          and seekers, <b><i>Psychedelics and the Soul</i></b
          >invokes the traditions of Jungian depth psychology, mythology, and
          Indigenous cultural wisdom to meet a critical question of our times:
          How can the emerging field of psychedelic medicine heal the soul amid
          planetary crisis and collective opportunity?<br /><br />Psychedelic
          therapist Simon Yugler invites the reader on a mythological journey,
          using depth psychology to explore 10 universal themes that transcend
          our individual experiences—and reveal how psychedelic medicine can
          heal the soul and our collective unconscious in a time of uncertainty
          and initiation:<br /><br /><b>The Well:</b> The Unconscious,
          Symbolism, &amp; the Mythic Unknown<b>The Temple:</b> Beyond Set &amp;
          Setting<b>The Underworld:</b> Shadow, Grief, &amp; the Descent to
          Soul<b>The Serpent:</b> Psychedelic Somatics &amp; Shedding Your
          Skin<b>The Monstrous:</b> Trauma, Exiles, &amp; the Wound That Heals<b
            >The Trickster:</b
          >
          Marginality, the Crossroads, &amp; the Liminal Road<b>The Guide: </b
          >Power, Authenticity, &amp; Inner Authority<b>The Sacred Mountain:</b>
          Vision,&nbsp;Ecstasy, &amp; Becoming Nobody<b>The Tree of Life:</b>
          Animism, Climate Change, &amp; the Ensouled Earth<b
            >The Journey Home:</b
          >
          Integration, Community, &amp; Dancing with the Village<br />Each
          archetype acts as a prism, using myth, fable, and universal wisdom to
          reflect back to the reader the collective experiences and unconscious
          truths that shape our psyches—and that are made more profound and
          accessible through psychedelics. Yugler shares how entheogens and
          plant medicine open a gateway to our understanding of our culture,
          selves, and interconnected reality toward wide-scale social and
          planetary healing.

          myths.... We need books like this to remind us to offer something
