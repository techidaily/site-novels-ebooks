          This is the story of a remarkable Native American who through his own
          life struggles learned to unite the paths of warrior and healer. Two
          Ravens was taught the traditional healing ways of his Mandan, Hidatsa,
          and Arickara people by his grandfather, knowledge which served him
          well in his dealings with the hostile white society he later
          encountered. After years of rampant discrimination and racism, he
          became a warrior in the fight for the rights of his people He joined
          the efforts of Leonard Peltier, Leonard Crow Dog, Frank Clearwater,
          and many other prominent leaders to ensure that his people might live
          in peace and with respect. But the constant battles often left Two
          Ravens censured both by fellow Native Americans who supported a more
          conservative political agenda and white law enforcement agencies who
          considered him an outlaw. Pulled between different worlds, he
          struggled against alcoholism and despair. It was only when he returned
          to his grandfather's teachings that he discovered a way to join the
          paths of the warrior and the healer. In the years before his death,
          Two Ravens worked as a substance abuse counselor and spiritual
          advisor, helping others integrate Native American traditions into
          their lives in contemporary America. <br />Offers personal insights
          from a Native American who worked with the American Indian Movement
          from its inception

          look at how to reconnect to the spirit is essential to happiness in
