          • Describes the Celtic rituals of honoring death and dying and offers
          prayers, meditations, and blessings for the time of transition
          <br /><br />• Offers reflective questions and exercises to explore
          your beliefs, attitudes, and fears around your own death <br /><br />•
          Includes the sacred meditation of traveling with the dead as offered
          by an <i>anam-áire</i> or Celtic soul carer <br /><br />THE CELTS
          BELIEVED in the transmigration of the soul, in the magical rhythm of
          life with a particular order of coming and going for each soul. As
          they celebrated every new stage of their lives with a ritual, they
          also honoured the passing of a soul--the death of the physical body.
          <br /><br />In her decades of work with the dying, Phyllida Anam-Áire
          has revived the ancient Celtic tradition of watching with the dying
          and traveling with the soul after death. Integrating the wisdom of her
          Celtic ancestors with modern knowledge of the death process, she shows
          how a peaceful transition for the leaving person is possible and how
          this process can be consciously supported by relatives or friends.
          <br /><br />Reflective exercises and meditations help us become aware
          of our beliefs and fears around dying and acknowledge our own death as
          a natural transformation, allowing our essence to move on into love.
          Once we come to terms with our own mortality, we will find it easier
          to assist family and friends in their last hours in this life.
          Rituals, prayers, and blessings in this guide offer compassionate
          support for the one transitioning and for those left behind. Phyllida
          also shares the sacred meditation of traveling with the dead as held
          by a Celtic Anam-Áire, or soul carer. In addition, she addresses many
          practical questions around the care for the dying and their
          environment during and after the process, stressing the importance of
          silence.<br /><br />A practical yet soulful guidebook,
          <i>A Celtic Book of Dying</i> deepens our spiritual understanding of
          the internal journey of the dying and the adventurous afterdeath
          journey still to embark on. Dying is the most natural step we will
          ever take.

          “Phyllida draws from the deep well of her own life journey and the
          wellsprings of the ancient spiritual and mythological wisdom held
          within the ancestral memory of Ireland. Our ancestors embodied a
          nondualistic perspective concerning life and death that emerged from
          their close connections with the natural world and its rhythms. Life
          was understood as a river of presence that flowed in and out of many
          different forms, and death was understood as a natural part of the
          continuum of life, death, and rebirth. Earlier cultures saw death as a
          transformation of form rather than the end of life. These insights are
          urgently needed in our death-phobic culture. This book is a wonderful
          spiritual, philosophical, and practical resource to educate and guide
          people who are dying and those who are journeying with them. With
          insights, practices, prayers, and blessings to support the journey for
          everyone involved, this book offers all of us an amazing opportunity
          to grow in awareness, in consciousness, and in unconditional love and
          acceptance.”
