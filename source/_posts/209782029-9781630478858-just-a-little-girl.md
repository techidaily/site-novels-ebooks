            >A teenager. A near-death experience. A spiritual journey that will
            last a lifetime. “Her testimony will ignite the flame of faith in
            many” (Susie Jennings, author of
            <i>31 Days of Mountaintop Miracles</i>).</b
          ><br /><br />When eighteen-year-old Victoria dies in the ICU and
          encounters an angel that gives her a prophetic mandate from God, her
          insatiable quest for spiritual enlightenment begins. As compelling as
          any contemporary novel, this dramatic and inspiring true story is a
          roller-coaster ride through supernatural experience, denominational
          enlightenment, and a teenage marriage that not only survives the loss
          of a child but thrives through unbeatable odds.<br /><br />Shining a
          fresh light on the theology of a Jewish Jesus, the author deftly
          weaves the history of the Christian faith from its genesis of the
          first century to the present-day Greco-Roman Christianity—all the
          while giving us an up close and personal glimpse of an extraordinary
          life.<br /><br />A devoted wife, mother of six, and grandmother of
          nineteen, Victoria refuses to succumb to age and limitations. Far from
          <i>Just a Little Girl</i>, Victoria Sarvadi’s unconventional journey
          from teenage motherhood to Hebraic scholar and teacher will captivate
          and consume you from start to finish.<br /><br />“Heartwarming,
          encouraging, inspirational and hard to put down. A very personal and
          uplifting book filled with life as it is.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A
          testament of God, His love, and faith in answered prayers.” —Dr. Chris
          and Sasha Holloway, ministers and recording artists<br /><br />“Dr.
          Victoria Sarvadi is a storyteller unlike none other and her story is
          so unique and special that it moved me to tears, laughter and mostly
          to give thanksgiving to our G-D. This book is a must read!” —Rabbi
          Itzhak Shapira, author of <i>The Return of the Kosher Pig</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dr. Victoria Sarvadi received her Th.M. and Th.D. in 2005 from the
          former Center for the Study of Biblical Research in Glendora,
          California, accredited at the time by the University of the State of
          California. A certified minister in the Hebraic Christian Global
          Community since 2000, she is a frequent contributor to Restore!
          Magazine, a publication of the HCGC. She has been a speaker for
          conferences, congregations, women’s ministry groups, Bible studies,
          and at the Vision for Israel Sukkot Conferences in Jerusalem, Israel.
          As a featured guest on national and international radio and television
          programs, her appearances on both the Crossover Program and Brad TV
          have been seen worldwide. Her Precious Gems teachings on the Jewish
          roots of Christianity have appeared in numerous publications and will
          soon be available online at VictoriaSarvadi.com. She has six children,
          nineteen grandchildren, and is married to Paul Sarvadi, Chairman, CEO,
          and Co-Founder of Insperity, Inc., a world leader in business and
          human resources services based in Kingwood, Texas. As co-founders of
          the Nathaniel Foundation, the Sarvadis philanthropic contributions
          support numerous charities in the U.S. and abroad. All proceeds from
          <i>Just a Little Girl</i> will fund the Nathaniel Foundation.
