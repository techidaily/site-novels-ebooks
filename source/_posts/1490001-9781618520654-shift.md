          Powerful, life-altering information from an enlightened being of the
          Pleiadian star system, channeled through the author...<br /><br />Heather
          Wallace has been channeling information for more than a decade. To use
          her word, “translator” is a more accurate term for what she does when
          she connects with spiritually aware entities from the spirit plane.
          She only connects and collaborates with beings working toward the
          greater good with love and integrity; she protects herself from
          malevolent beings and does not allow them to break through her psychic
          barriers. For her collaboration on Shift: New Paradigms for a New
          Earth, she connected with a being called “Holly” from the Pleiadian
          star system and it is through Holly that she presents transformational
          information accessible to anyone interested to evolve to a more
          enlightened existence.&nbsp;<br /><br />In<i
            >&nbsp;Shift: New Paradigms for a New Earth&nbsp;</i
          >Holly reveals outmoded programs that do not support self-empowerment
          or self-love and introduces ways in which the reader can shift these
          outmoded paradigms, embracing new ideas and concepts that align with
          our divine being. Holly explains our evolution from a mental-driven
          culture into a heart-centered species and how our previous patterns of
          behavior are no longer serving us. She covers the nature of time as
          not being linear, reincarnation, our nature as multidimensional
          beings, why we are here, vibrational frequency and other dimensions.
          As we move into a new age of expanded spiritual awareness, these
          subjects are becoming part of our accepted knowledge base and reality.
          Our vibration has shifted, and continues to shift, bringing us into an
          unprecedented era of expansion. It reasonably follows that new
          knowledge will now be available to us that is in resonance with our
          new vibration.&nbsp;<br /><br /><i
            >Shift: New Paradigms for a New Earth</i
          >&nbsp;will teach you:About the earth’s new vibrational plane and how
          to operate in this new spaceHow to have healthy, happy
          relationships—with yourself, your mate and the world around youHow to
          heal conflict at the personal and global levelsHow to bring your
          emotional, mental, and spiritual selves into balanceThe difference
          between the law of attraction and manifestation, and how to use both
          to create what you want in your lifeThe nature of the soul and
          ourselves as multidimensional beingsThe purpose behind violence and
          natural disasters<i>Shift: New Paradigms for a New Earth</i>&nbsp;is a
          practical guide and presents relatable, simple examples and exercises
          to help the reader fully embrace the information and put it into
          practical application in their everyday life.
