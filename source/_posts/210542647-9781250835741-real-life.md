              >Merging the insights of inspiring voices with her own
              understanding of mindfulness, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
              author Sharon Salzberg shows us how we can recover from the
              emotional effects of crisis.<br /><br /></b
            >When confronted with pain and obstacles, we often shrink back and
            contract out of fear and disappointment. That can become a way of
            life.<br /><br />In <i>Real Life</i>, Sharon Salzberg lets us know
            it doesn’t have to be that way.<br /><br />When we feel alone, cut
            off, or trapped, we can let those difficulties steer us onto a path
            toward an authentic, flourishing life—living in a way that allows us
            to find the wholeness that lies within. Even when we’re alone, a
            sense of community can accompany us through the stormy times. Our
            words, hearts, and actions can line up with a larger vision, rather
            than the smaller views our anxious, fearful thoughts arouse in
            us.<br /><br />To live in a less constricted way—with a more
            spacious, open sense of possibility, creativity, connection, and
            joy—Salzberg says we need to get real about what’s most important,
            to ask ourselves, “What do I most deeply yearn for?” “What would I
            benefit from letting go of?” “What do I believe is possible for
            me?”<br /><br />We accomplish the journey to expansive freedom (Real
            Life) through developing tools like mindful awareness, friendship,
            and a greater sense of purpose/aspiration. We learn to:<br />• take
            some risks with what we dare to imagine<br />• take an interest in
            internal states we might normally try to avoid<br />• take an
            interest in people we might normally try to avoid<br /><br /><i
              >Real Life</i
            >
            is about the journey we make when we decide to live the life that
            speaks to our innermost longing to live free.

          writes from a place filled with love and simplicity. With
          <i>Real Life</i>, she gives profoundly effective advice about emerging
          from the dark corners where we find ourselves. Her insights are
          life-changing.”<br />- <b>Mary Louise Parker</b>, star of Showtime’s
          <i>Weeds</i><br /><br />“<i>Real Life</i> has the power to

          over ourselves and get out of our heads — so that we can do hard
          things and generally do life better. This book will help you shed old,
          unhelpful patterns and escape what David Foster Wallace once called
          ‘the skull-sized kingdom’. Check it out.”<br />- <b>Dan Harris</b>,
          author of <i>10% Happier</i><br /><br />“What a joy to soak in these
          illuminating ideas and engaging stories of how we each can mice more

          challenges. “<br />- <b>Rabbi Angela W. Buchdahl</b><br /><br />“The
          jewel in the crown of the Real series. This gift of a book is filled

            David DeSteno</b
          >, host of the PRX Podcast How God Works<br /><br />“<i>Real Life</i>
          is far more than piercing, fierce instructions for cultivating
          lovingkindness as a means for our connection. It is also an elegy for
          the heartache of isolation and pathway to connection..”<br />–<b>
