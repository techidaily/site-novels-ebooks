          ‘Shaman’, meaning ‘intermediary between spirit and the natural world’,
          has become a much overused word in the West. It’s not a job title one
          can give oneself, and in indigenous societies, a shaman is usually
          born to this role. Ya’Acov Darling Khan is one of the few westerners
          who have been acknowledged as shamans by indigenous elders or
          teachers.<br /><br />After being hit by lightning, Ya’Acov took a
          30-year journey into the heart of shamanism to seek his own healing,
          and to learn how he could serve others with the wisdom he acquired
          through his experiences. He has studied with indigenous teachers from
          the Arctic Circle to the USA and South America, and has taken part in
          ceremonies in such diverse locations as Welsh caves to the depths of
          the Amazon rainforest. Nowadays, Ya’Acov continues to study and
          regularly journeys to the Ecuadorean Amazon to work alongside the
          Achuar and Sápara people.<br /><br />For thousands of years, shamans
          helped the people in their communities remain in balance with
          themselves, each other, the natural world and the spirit world. This
          beautifully written book is not only a powerfully honest, humorous and
          inspiring memoir, but a guidebook for those from many cultures and
          walks of life wishing to return to their indigenous roots, and be part
          of midwifing a more benign human presence here on Earth as part of a
          new dream.

          <i>‘Jaguar in the Body, Butterfly in the Heart</i>&nbsp;is a
          magnificent adventure story that travels like an arrow right into the
          heart of what it means to be a conscious human being. Like all stories
          told with unflinching honesty and humility, this one has the potential
          to heal the reader, and help him or her remember who they really truly
          are.’<br /><b>Dr Christiane&nbsp;Northrup</b>, New
          York&nbsp;Times&nbsp;bestselling&nbsp;author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i
            >Goddesses&nbsp;Never Age&nbsp;</i
          >and&nbsp;<i>Women’s Bodies, Women’s&nbsp;Wisdom</i><br /><br />‘<i
            >Jaguar in the Body, Butterfly in the Heart</i
          >&nbsp;charts the journey of a young man treading the path of an
          ancient vocation in a modern world. In his wise, funny and tender
          book, Ya’Acov Darling Khan writes of his teachers and experiences with
          compelling generosity and practicality, and lessons abound. Shamanic
          teaching that is accessible and divine.’<br /><b>Sophie Dahl</b>,
          author<br /><br />‘Ya’Acov Darling Khan has written an exquisite and
          important book that places the great and deep work of shamanism in its
          rightful context in this critical time in human history. For too long,
          shamanism has been seen as a left-field weekend pastime that is
          divorced from the challenges that we face as a species. Ya’Acov’s
          story of his 30-year initiation into the shaman’s world is an
          invitation for us to look deeply into what matters most to us and to
          find the courage to live from this place. Ya’Acov’s book is vital for
          all of us who are ready to find the passion, dedication and courage to
          bring our visions to Earth and to leave a legacy for our descendants
          that we can be proud of.’<br /><b>Lynne&nbsp;Twist</b>,

          Alliance&nbsp;and&nbsp;author&nbsp;of
          The&nbsp;Soul&nbsp;of&nbsp;Money<br /><br />‘An important shamanic
          ritual involves “dismembering and remembering” – releasing
          dysfunctional patterns of thought and behaviour in order to embrace
          beneficial new ones. Through this beautiful book Ya’Acov offers that
          ritual for a world of humans who need to rebalance and remember
          themselves and their relationship with all else. He sings the
          shapeshifter’s song; that song awakens a new dream, it manifests a new
          reality.’<br /><b>John&nbsp;Perkins</b>,&nbsp;<i
            >New York&nbsp;Times&nbsp;</i
          >bestselling&nbsp;author<br /><br />‘As our world rocks with each new
          onslaught of unresolved human pain, there comes a bright light to
          remind us that we have resources far beyond our own: that we have help
          if we ask for it and that help is transformative. Written with
          integrity, authenticity and the flowing, addictive poetry of a born
          storyteller, Ya’Acov’s book is a must-read for anyone who seeks to
          share in the bounty of the greater spirits of this world and
          beyond.&nbsp;Ya’Acov’s journey as a shaman began long before the
          current fashion for all things shamanic. When it comes to
          spirituality, many people talk the talk, but few actually embody the
          teachings in their day-to-day life.’<br /><b>Manda&nbsp;Scott</b>,

          that goes from a sincere but innocent day-dreaming about shamanism, to
          the struggles, doubts, failure and eventual victories to be found for
          those who travel far enough and persist for long enough to discover
          the secrets of shifting consciousness, and then bring them back to the
          world of our everyday affairs.&nbsp;What I love about him and the
          journey he shares in this book is that his passion for the Spirit has
          always been so strong, and was not broken when ego-driven fantasies
          were shattered again and again by the bitter-sweet kiss of everyday
          reality.’<br /><b>Victor&nbsp;Sanchez</b>, researcher, author,

          Living&nbsp;Purposefully) and&nbsp;toltecas.org<br /><br />‘Ya’Acov is
          a medicine man of the highest integrity. His shamanic skill and
          embodiment transcend culture to reach the universal place of humanity
          and spirit. One doesn’t declare oneself a shaman, the people do. When
          we are in the rainforest together, the indigenous people line up for
          healings with Ya’Acov, who works side by side with the elder tribal
          shaman.&nbsp;In his book, Ya’Acov demystifies the original vocation,
          one often shrouded in misperceptions and aggrandizement in modern
          times. As our current systems and structures break down, more and more
          people are turning to the ancient shamanic worldview of
          interconnectivity and meaning.&nbsp;<i
