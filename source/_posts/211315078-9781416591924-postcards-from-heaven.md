              in which a soul already departed reaches back to us who have been
              left behind.... Sometimes, it's no more than a whisper, a familiar
              smell in the air, or just the feeling of presence as vivid as when
              the loved one was still alive. These moments are just
              that...moments, a glimpse behind the veil; not a letter from
              heaven, but a postcard." (Dan Gordon,</i

            Postcards from Heaven)</b
          ><br /><br />
          A postcard from heaven is not a revelation from on high -- rather,
          it's "a whisper, a familiar smell in the air, or just the feeling of
          presence" of someone who's passed away. It is just enough of a message
          to imply that what we call life is not ended by what we call death.
          <br /><br />
          Dan Gordon has been receiving these postcards all his life -- from his
          father, his older brother, and his son Zaki, who was killed in a car
          accident when he was only twenty-two. <i>Postcards from Heaven</i> is
          the beautiful, inspirational memoir of four generations of a
          remarkable family and how they remain interconnected, a part of one
          another's stories, even after passing to the other side. Here is the
          span of his father's long life, moving and funny, from the Russian
          Revolution to his improbable Depression-era courtship of a woman named
          Goddess -- Gordon's mother -- to his spiritual later years in Israel;
          his incorrigible older brother's mischievous magic, able to find humor
          even in cancer treatment; and his brilliant son, a natural storyteller
          who looked destined to follow his father into the movie business.
          These are the stories of their lives on earth as well as after death.
          <br /><br />
          Full of humor, compassion, and love,
          <i>Postcards from Heaven</i> comforts and assures us that those we
          loved can reach back to those of us still on earth -- and, if only we
          are attentive enough to listen, we can hear them say, <br /><br /><b
            ><i>
              Got here safe. <br /><br />
              It's really beautiful. <br /><br />
              Much love, till we meet again.
