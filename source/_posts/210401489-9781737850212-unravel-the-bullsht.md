              >Unravel the Bullsh*t is one woman's story of disappointment,
              survival, forgiveness, and rediscovering her feminine greatness
              and how those emotions took her from a wild, exciting, beautiful,
              bicoastal life to discovering her true calling. While
              over-caffeinating, over-stimulating, and over-compensating, Morgan
              Chonis did everything she could to ignore her body's attempts to
              slow her down.&nbsp;</span

              >After two broken vertebrae, a slew of addictions, and believing
              that she had to choose between having a family and being
              successful, Morgan Chonis finally had all the fame and fortune she
              desired. But beneath it all, at the peak of her success, Chonis
              was smoking three to four cigarettes per sitting and contemplating
              how to successfully commit suicide. Until she sought a higher
              power she didn't even believe in and prayed for relief from her
              pain. What happened next crashed her entire life into the ground,
              taking with it every penny and sliver of dignity that she could
              muster.&nbsp;</span

              >In this three-part memoir, Chonis chronicles how she was
              societally conditioned and trained as a good girl destined for
              greatness until the universe finally said ENOUGH! She guides the
              reader through The Conditioning, The Crumbling, and the rise of
              The Phoenix as she holds up the mirror of self-reflection to see
              where we each may be in our own human experience. Part memoir,
              part self-help, Chonis shares her experience, strength, and hope
              in order to shed light on the work required to unravel the
              bullshit stories keeping us from greatness.</span

            together in its right timing, as it should. Her language is modern

            reading this, I have seen how I people please and make decisions

            looking deeply into what </span

            raw, honest and eye-opening! A true page turner that incites an
            emotional response with every page, and I loved every minute. I

            >"Unravel the Bullshit touched me on a soul level. For me, reading
            this book was like I was sitting in the passenger seat next to
            Morgan the whole ride through her journey. I laughed with her, I
            cried with her, I held on tight through every twist and turn with
            her and most importantly, I grew with her. I have the universal
            blessing of knowing Morgan personally so there were times during the
            book that I felt her pain, her strength and her triumph. Morgan's
            journey made me want to do better, to be better and live better. She
            truly shares so much of her heart and soul with us in this book and
            I'm so incredibly grateful that she will be able to reach so many
            others with her platform! Everyone deserves a little sprinkle of
            Morgan in their life and I believe this book is only the beginning
            of what the universe has in store for her and us because when you
            get to the last page, I guarantee you'll be asking for more! So dive
            in head first friends! You're in for the journey of a lifetime!" -
