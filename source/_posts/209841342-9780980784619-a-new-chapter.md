          "A vision of hope in a world seemingly gone mad. Dana Mrkich makes
          sense of it all with powerful insights and practical advice you can
          use to herald the consciousness shift taking place within us all." -
          David Rippe, Author of THE FLIP-TURN YOUR WORLD AROUND"A guidebook to
          a future we have yet to create...Dana Mrkich is truly one of
          Australia's global citizens and emissaries of personal and cultural
          transformation." - Robert Rabbin, Author of REAL TIME SPEAKING: YOU
          ARE THE MESSAGE."A New Chapter is a wonderful book encouraging us to
          live our dreams without forgetting our brothers and sisters, showing
          us that only the energy of living within generates the ability to live
          in peace and love with all humanity. Create a New Reality...YES!" -
          Sesto Giovanni Castagnoli, President, World Spirit Forum"This book
          left me with a glorious sense of empowerment, and excitement about
          being alive at such a crossroads for the earth's and humanity's
          progress...the message is simple yet revolutionary; a joy to read." -
          Desanka Vukelich, Freelance Editor"There are more and more of us
          worldwide looking for books like this one. We are the ones looking for
          ways to come out with our own truth, our own inner knowing of what's
          good, decent and right, and what we don't want to put up with anymore
          in our society, in our humanity or in our selves. A New Chapter sets
          the stage to encourage us to live our own truth." - Barbara Harris
          Whitfield, RT Author and therapist, Author of Spiritual Awakenings,
          Co-Author of The Power of Humility"The world needs this book - and
          most amazingly of all I think the world is ready for this book. Each
          chapter fills me with more excitement than the last!" - Rebecca,
          Sydney Australia"I love the way you've written the book, it's so
          accessible to everyone and it's tying together so much of what I have
          learned, experienced and felt from a young age. It's not watered down,
          it's very real. You have inspired me to be more of me." - Amy, Sydney,
          Australia"Confirmation of my beliefs, my thoughts about the future, of
          my own spiritual growth and journey and more. A beautiful book, I
          believe that every person who is on this earth should get this
          information." - Michelle, Sweden
