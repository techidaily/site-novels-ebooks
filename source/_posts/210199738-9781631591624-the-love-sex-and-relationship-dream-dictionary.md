            Have you dreamed of a handsome stranger and felt the pangs of love
            (or lust)? Do you wake up panicked from being chased by a menacing
            intruder or from falling from a cliff into darkness? Do you wake up
            to dreams of sex with an ex, your boss, or a celebrity?
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't be ashamed or alarmed! These dreams are normal and highly
            symbolic. Learn to decode dream symbols through the steamed-up
            lenses of our relationships, sexuality, and our human imperative to
            love and be loved. This guide will show you how to interpret
            everything and everyone in your dreams as an aspect of yourself.
            After all, the best relationship advice you can receive is being
            revealed by your own brilliant dreaming mind. To that end, this
            bedside companion offers:

          "Kelly Sullivan Walden is a delightful ambassador for dreaming,
          helping us to bring gifts from the night into everyday life in fresh
          and fun ways. I am firmly convinced that the most important dream
          dictionary you will ever read is the one that you'll produce by
          keeping a dream journal over time. However, we are often clueless
          about dreams and can use some prompts, and Kelly is almost
          irresistible as a prompter and provocateur. The great gift of her new,
          bubbly, sexy book is that it inspires you to meet and marry the many
          aspects of yourself. She grabs us right away with the promises that we
          are going to decode dreams with 'steamed-up lenses' and that sex
          dreams are 'the ultimate safe-sex practice' from which we can come
          home glowing and guiltless. Through all the wild romps, she is
          actually luring us along the path to wholeness that Jung called
          individuation.
          <i>The Love, Sex &amp; Relationship Dream Dictionary</i> may help you
          to look for love in all the unexpected places. It may also arouse you
          to embark on your greatest love affair: with your greater Self.";

          "I never realized our dreams - this thing we all experience every
          night - were so full of insight, wisdom, and practical guidance that
          make our waking lives work better - particularly our love lives. And
          because relationships are such an important part of our lives, a
          guidebook like Kelly's <i>The</i
          ><i>Love, Sex &amp; Relationship Dream Dictionary </i>is a crucial
          tool to help us understand how to love each other more fully. I've
          been impressed with Kelly's uncanny ability to interpret dreams and
          use them as a laser to help us see how powerful we are - and how to
          work through our blocks to owning our power."

          "Our dreams can reveal the most important insights - that flies just

          Walden's <i>Love, Sex &amp; Relationship Dream Dictionary</i> helps us
          bridge the gap between our conscious and subconscious, our spirit and
          our body so that we can have the personal relationships we've always
          dreamed were possible."

          "Finding the 'one' is an inside job, and without an awareness of our

          Sullivan Walden's
          <i>The Love, Sex &amp; Relationship Dream Dictionary</i> is that it
          guides you to hear the voice of your subconscious mind, which speaks
