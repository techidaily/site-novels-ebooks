          Reveals the radical ancient practice of living resurrection, in which
          initiates ritually died and were reborn into a state of higher
          consciousness <br />
          <br />• Explores living resurrection initiation practices from world
          cultures, including Egyptian, Greek, Gnostic, Chinese, Celtic, and
          Native American traditions <br />
          <br />• Describes the secret chambers and temples where Mystery
          Schools practiced “raising the dead” <br />
          <br />• Shows why this practice was branded a heresy and suppressed by
          the Church <br />
          <br />More than two thousand years before the resurrection of Jesus,
          initiates from spiritual traditions around the world were already
          practicing a secret mystical ritual in which they metaphorically died
          and were reborn into a higher spiritual state. During this living
          resurrection, they experienced a transformative spiritual awakening
          that revealed the nature of reality and the purpose of the soul,
          described as “rising from the dead.” <br />
          <br />Exploring the practice of living resurrection in ancient
          Egyptian, Phoenician, Greek, Persian, Indian, Japanese, Chinese,
          Celtic, and Native American traditions, Freddy Silva explains how
          resurrection was never meant for the dead, but for the living--a fact
          supported by the suppressed Gnostic Gospel of Philip: “Those who say
          they will die first and then rise are in error. If they do not first
          receive the resurrection while they live, when they die they will
          receive nothing.” He reveals how these practices were not only common
          in the ancient world but also shared similar facets in each tradition:
          initiates were led through a series of challenging ordeals, retreated
          for a three-day period into a cave or restricted room, often called a
          “bridal chamber,” and while out-of-body, became fully conscious of
          travels in the Otherworld. Upon returning to the body, they were led
          by priests or priestesses to witness the rising of Sirius or the
          Equinox sunrise. <br />
          <br />Silva describes some of the secret chambers around the world
          where the ritual was performed, including the so-called tomb of
          Thutmosis III in Egypt, which featured an empty sarcophagus and
          detailed instructions for the living on how to enter the Otherworld
          and return alive. He reveals why esoteric and Gnostic sects claimed
          that the literal resurrection of Jesus promoted by the Church was a
          fraud and how the Church branded all living resurrection practices as
          a heresy, relentlessly persecuting the Gnostics to suppress knowledge
          of this self-empowering experience. He shows how the Knights Templar
          revived these concepts and how they survive to this day within
          Freemasonry. <br />
          <br />Exploring the hidden art of living resurrection, Silva shows how
          this personal experience of the Divine opened the path to
          self-empowerment and higher consciousness, leading initiates such as
          Plato to describe it as the pinnacle of spiritual development.

          “This is a breakthrough work that topples not only church dogma but a
          century of pyramidiots stumped by Egypt’s elusively empty sarcophagi.
          No mummy there! No, it’s all about the round-trip journey to the
          spirit world and what our ancestors were really doing in their
          secluded temples. Fabulously illustrated, this important book is as
          much about the cosmogony of the ancient wisdomkeepers as it is about
          the hidden chambers of the human mind.”
