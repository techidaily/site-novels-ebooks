            ><i>Sensual </i>is a guide to understanding the inner spark we are
            all born with, why and how we lose it, and how to reclaim our power
            to live the life we truly want.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Sensuality is about more than just pleasure. Sensuality is an innate
          power that can help you to tune in to your body, mind, and spirit. To
          be sensual is to know yourself so intimately that you can move through
          life with confidence and clarity, deeply connected to the fire
          within.<br /><br />
          In this book, Henika Patel invites you on a journey of expansion to
          find your unapologetic, unashamed, fully expressed sensual spirit.
          Blending Eastern philosophy and Western psychology with practices,
          rituals, and stories from her own life, Henika will empower you to:<br /><br />
          – Overcome blocks, shame, and numbness<br />
          – Unleash and express your authentic desires<br />
          – Discover your inner spark and confidence<br />
          – Find sensuality, connection, and freedom in all areas of your life,
          from love and creativity to work and relationships<br /><br />
          Are you ready to connect with your sensual power?
