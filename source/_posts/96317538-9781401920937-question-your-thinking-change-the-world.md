            >“A spiritual innovator for the new millennium.”&nbsp;—<i>Time</i
            ><br />“Byron Katie’s Work is a great blessing for our
            planet.”&nbsp;—Eckhart Tolle<br /><br />Inspirational quotes to help
            you along your journey of self-inquiry as you navigate love and
            relationships; sickness and health; work and money; and much
            more.</b
          ><br /><br />
          The profound, lighthearted wisdom embodied within is not theoretical;
          it is absolutely authentic. Here, she discusses the most essential
          issues that face us all:<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • Love, Sex, and Relationships<br />
          •&nbsp;Health, Sickness, and Death<br />
          •&nbsp;Parents and Children<br />
          •&nbsp;Work and Money<br />
          •&nbsp;Self-Realization<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Not only will this book help you with you these specific issues, but
          it will point you toward your own wisdom and will encourage you to
          question your own mind, using the 4 simple yet incredibly powerful
          questions of Katie’s process of self-inquiry, called The Work.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />1) Is it true?<br />2) Can you absolutely know that it’s
          true?<br />3) How do you react when you believe that thought?<br />4)
          Who would you be without the thought?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Katie is a living example of the clear, all-embracing love that is our
          true identity. Because she has thoroughly questioned her own mind, her
          words shine with the joy of understanding. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “People used to ask me if I was enlightened,” she says, “and I would
          say, ‘I don’t know anything about that. I’m just someone who knows the
          difference between what hurts and what doesn’t.’ I’m someone who wants
          only what is. To meet as a friend each concept that arose turned out
          to be my freedom.

          “A spiritual innovator for the new millennium. The charismatic Katie
          acts as a combination mystical guide, wise-cracking therapist and
          knowing parent.” <br /><b>— Time&nbsp;</b>magazine
          <br /><br />“Katie’s laser-like tough love burns away all
          illusions.”<br /><b>— The Times</b> (London)<br /><br />“Byron Katie’s
          Work is a great blessing for our planet. It acts like a razor-sharp
          sword that cuts through illusions and enables you to know for yourself
          the timeless essence of your being.” <br /><b>— Eckhart Tolle</b>,
          author of <i>The Power of Now</i><br /><br />“Suppose you could find a
          simple way to embrace your life with joy, and achieve serenity in the
          midst of chaos? That is what Katie offers. It is no less than a
          revolutionary way to live your life. The question is: are we brave
          enough to accept it?” <br /><b>— Erica Jong</b>, author of
          <i>Fear of Flying</i><br /><br />“Katie’s Work is a wonderful,
          transformative practice for anyone interested in spiritual growth.”<br /><b
            >— Lama Surya Das</b
          >, author of <i>Awakening the Buddha Within</i><br /><br />“The Work
          of Byron Katie is a completely accessible user-friendly form of the
          ancient way of spiritual inquiry, a simple method that anyone can use
          to untangle difficulties in work, love and family, and at the same
          time it opens the deepest spiritual directions.” <br /><b
            >— John Tarrant</b
          >, author of <i>The Light Inside the Dark</i><br /><br />“The Work of
          Byron Katie is a powerful process of discovery, a key that unlocks the
          heart. Byron Katie’s insight into what is at the core of happiness and
          fulfillment is truly enlightening.” <br /><b>— Anthony Robbins</b>,
          author of <i>Awaken the Giant Within</i><br /><br />“Katie’s teachings
          and everyday life are pure wisdom. She shows us the way to inner
          peace, and she directs us there fearlessly, relentlessly, and with
          utmost generosity. I have rarely seen anyone—spiritual teachers
          included—embody wisdom as powerfully as Katie in her passionate
          embrace of each and every moment.” <br /><b>— Roshi Bernie Glassman</b
