          Conventional wisdom traces Tarot cards to medieval Italy, but their
          roots go back much further in time and draw on a surprisingly rich
          variety of cultures and spiritual traditions. Combining pioneering
          scholarship with practical spiritual instruction,
          <i>Origins of the Tarot</i> is the first book to unveil the full range
          of the ancient streams of wisdom from which the Tarot emerged.The
          timeless principles of conscious realization and cosmological
          unfoldment underlying the Tarot have never been explored in a
          comparably extensive and detailed way: herein the teachings of a
          tremendous range of traditions, including Kabbalah, Western
          esotericism and alchemy, Buddhism, Taoism, yogic disciplines, Sufism,
          mystical Christianity, Gnosticism, and Neoplatonism, are masterfully
          incorporated and synthesized.Author Dai Léon explores a confluence of
          philosophical schools from East and West as they relate to the Tarot,
          giving each its due in the exposition of a universal procession of
          evolution and the soul’s quest for enlightenment. In the process, the
          Tarot is seen as a unique exemplification of perennial teachings on
          the soul and its liberation, as well as a still-unfolding window into
          concealed currents of human history. The book’s profound learning and
          unprecedented range of references are sure to attract close study
          among students both of the world’s most enduring esoteric tradition
          and of esotericism itself.

        </h4>
        <p>
          A lifelong student of East-West philosophy and contemplation, Dai Léon
          has served for twenty-five years as a cultural emissary between modern
          and traditional, scientific and spiritual domains. He promotes the
          rich benefits of holistic and interdisciplinary studies and practices
          with respect to perennial wisdom traditions throughout the world. His
          primary retreat is on Waiheke Island, New Zealand.Dai began his
          studies of esoteric ritual, yoga, alchemy, and martial arts at the age
          of eight in France, where he was raised as a youngster. As a Catholic
          altar boy, he realized that he was destined to a life of spiritual
          awareness and service. He was subsequently schooled in America as a
          young mathematics savant during the 1960s and ’70s, when esoteric
          knowledge, meditation, yoga, and body movement were mixing together,
          flowering into a postmodern mélange of beauty and wisdom. From that
          heady mix of cultural alchemy emerged new paradigms of science and a
          re-appreciation for traditional nondual understandings of philosophy.
          Lao Tzu met Plotinus and Einstein, and the world has never been the
          same since.After studying the philosophies and spiritual ways of the
          great traditions at the University of Illinois, Dai was invited to
          directly study under the Venerable Gia-fu Feng, head of Stillpoint
          Foundation in Colorado. Adept Feng had been a co-founder of Esalen
          Institute at Big Sur, California, and was renowned as a founding
          father of the East-West movement, merging nondual traditions from
          China to Spain to America. In the spring of 1978, Sifu (indicating
          "monk" or "teacher") Dai Sealed Heart-Mind with Master Feng (a
          traditional method of Lineage or Dharma Transmission). Following this,
          it was requested that he teach the Tao that is none other than the One
          of Heraclitus, Plotinus, and Western wisdom through the ages.Dai has
          authored several books and interactive media titles. He has served as
          a Director of multicultural, educational, interactive companies for
          twenty-five years. Since 1994 he has advised industry and governmental
          bodies on the socio-cultural impact of financial, wellness, and
          interactive technologies. Through many forms of media, with a
          particular love and focus upon that of the ecstatic body-mind, Dai has
          taught in a traditional yet postmodern way. His flowing mantra is to
          empower, enlighten, and entertain.
