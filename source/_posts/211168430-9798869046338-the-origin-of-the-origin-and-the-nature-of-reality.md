              >For the first time in history, the authors Mr Steven Voysey and
              Dr Mark Mitchelson from Cairns, Australia, have discovered the
              real explanation for crop circles which have been mysteriously
              appearing all over the world, since the seventeenth century. In
              their superlative masterpiece, the recently published book The
              Origin of the Origin and the Nature of Reality the authors have
              drawn on knowledge from many sources, to come to the startling
              conclusion that extraterrestrial civilizations with far greater
              intelligence than our own, are actively seeking to communicate
              with the citizens of planet Earth, with information encoded in
              crop circles, to enlighten and help us, with both the goal of
              attaining globalization, which is mutually self-beneficial to all
              the peoples inhabiting the Earth and which is also environmentally
              sustainable in the long term, without causing cataclysmic climate
              change. After studying certain ancient sacred geometry concepts,
              based on 'the perfect square' (02X02) base of the Great Pyramid of
              Giza, the authors have been able to construct, a new model and
              mechanism, which explains definitively, how a perpetual, binary,
              geometric multiverse would function and which also explains
              precisely, all phenomenon which is observed in this multiverse,
              including a new logical arrangement of the periodic table of
              chemical elements with 121 elements (that means the existence of 5
              new as of yet undiscovered chemical elements!!! ). The information
              required to make this light speed jump in technology, has been
              encoded in the geometrical construct of the Great Pyramid of Giza,
              for all the men and women of science to see, since the dawn of
              civilization. It is only at this time in our technological
              development, that we have been advanced enough, to read this
              'message in the bottle' accurately and perceive appropriately, the
              message, thus allowing us the opportunity to perfect our current
              civilization. Unfortunately, the time limit imposed by this
              system, in which we can act, is 2012, so we need to act quickly,
              in order to save the planet Earth and all of its inhabitants.
              Remember 'ye shall seek the truth, and the truth shall set you
              free' and all of those questions regarding the 'origins' of
              humanity which you have always wondered about will be answered.
              Remember, this is the dawning of the age of Aquarius and with the
              attainment of this knowledge, great advances in the structure of
              our society can occur!</span
