          How to break free from the physical world and travel via the energy
          body <br />
          <br />• Examines the seven secrets of time from the viewpoint of
          mystics and scientists, including Helena Blavatsky, C. W. Leadbeater,
          and Albert Einstein <br />
          <br />• Explains how transcending the physical body offers new hope
          for the treatment of illness, emotional problems, and addictions
          <br />
          <br />• Offers step-by-step instructions and exercises to develop your
          time travel abilities via the energy body <br />
          <br />Time remains the most misunderstood and mystical dimension of
          our experience of life. We never seem to have enough time, yet often
          it seems to drag by too slowly. Enthralled with the possibility of
          time travel and time machines, we long for the future or regret our
          past and wish for a way to break out of the linear progression of
          time. Behind all of this time fascination and obsession is the human
          urge to manage our destiny and feel in control of our world. Yet the
          secret to escaping temporal bondage is inside each of us, a soul-given
          power to visit the past or future and travel through the present at
          the speed of light. <br />
          <br />Exploring the 7 secrets of time, Von Braschler reveals how to
          break free from the physical world and travel through time and space
          via the energy body. He examines time, timelessness, and time travel
          from the viewpoint of mystics, shamanic dreamwalkers, and scientists,
          including Helena Blavatsky, C. W. Leadbeater, Albert Einstein, and
          Julian Barbour, as well as Hindu spiritual science. Explaining how
          transcending the physical body offers new hope for the treatment of
          illness, emotional problems, and addictions, he offers step-by-step
          instructions and active, out-of-body exercises to develop your time
          travel abilities and explore the world of energy and spirit.
          Emphasizing the spiritual wholeness that comes from energy body work,
          he shows that by visiting the past and the future we can more fully
          live in the now.

          “Thanks to the clarity of his insights and the freshness of his
          perspective, Von Braschler’s guide to time travel is our handbook to
          new, unchartered realms of experience and healing. The vehicle he
          offers is not a relatively crude ‘machine’ but the sublime human soul.
          In short, he tells us that we do not have to wait for the invention of
          some promised technology. On the contrary, we have been carrying
          around within us, since the day we were born, everything we need for
          visiting the past or future. He lays out seven secrets to access this
          wonderful mystery, clearly and convincingly describing them as the
          cornerstones of his practical guide.”
