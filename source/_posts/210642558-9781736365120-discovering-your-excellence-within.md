              >Within every individual is a storehouse of amazing treasures
              waiting to be discovered. Dr. Nick Pappas first realized this
              during his career as a minor league hockey player when at times he
              felt challenged to the extreme. While stress can weaken
              performance and energy levels, it can also be motivational and
              encourage the seeking of life-changing ideas and strategies that
              provide the ultimate competitive edge. Too many people, including
              athletes, fail to tap into their inner resources; instead, they
              try to cope with their unique pressures by engaging in negative
              behaviors that sometimes involve the use of harmful substances. In
              contrast, learning to utilize an array of empowering, yet often
              dormant, abilities residing within the deep holistic self is an
              incredible opportunity that can begin now. With time and
              consistent use, these powerful practices can promote greater
              levels of excellence and achievement by strengthening the
              physical, mental, emotional, energetic, relational, and spiritual
              aspects of the self-all of which are essential for reaching your
              true and highest potential. Written in an engaging style that
              includes examples of challenges facing both athletes and achievers
              from different walks of life, Discovering Your Excellence Within
              is a reader-friendly guide that reveals a dynamic holistic
              approach for bringing out the best in who you are and all you do.
              With its insightful narratives, practical strategies, and
              energizing techniques, this thought-provoking book combines the
              wisdom and truths of the ages with groundbreaking scientific
              discoveries to help enlighten and accelerate your journey to
              achieving greater levels of self-mastery, wholeness,
              self-improvement, and excellence.</strong

          "Written by an elite athlete with a Ph.D. in Human Development and
          Family Science, the book Discovering Your Excellence Within offers
          readers a holistic approach to finding and maintaining the skills
          needed to deliver your finest performances. Dr. Pappas combines theory
          and practical advice to provide a training guide for novices and a
          check-up for experienced athletes. Because of his focus on physical,
          mental, and spiritual strength, this book and its workbook can be of
          use not only to athletes, but to anyone who makes excellence a focus
          of their life."

          "Discovering Your Excellence Within provides readers with a
          comprehensive examination of what it takes to create excellence in all
          aspects of life, including academics, sports, and the workplace.
          Author Nick Pappas draws on a vast reserve of personal and
          professional experiences and research to outline his systematic
          approach to achievement. Given my own area of scholarship, I can
          recommend this book and its workbook to those individuals seeking
          self-improvement as well as to parents who are searching for ways to
          support the performance of their teenagers."&nbsp;

          "We all have the ability and resources to succeed, and we need to look
          no further than inside ourselves to find them. Nick Pappas shows us
          how to reach our truest and highest potential in his easy-to-read yet
          thought provoking book. Loaded with proven, empowering ideas, Pappas
          tells us how to avoid destructive, negative behaviors and develop
          powerful practices that can promote greater levels of excellence and
          achievement. This is different from other self-help books, since
          Pappas has lived the experience and walks his talk."
