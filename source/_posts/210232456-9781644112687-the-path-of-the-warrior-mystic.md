          • Explores the archetypal and classical male ideal found in ancient
          societies around the world <br /><br />• Examines some of the problems
          facing men in the world today and shares practices to develop yourself
          in the face of these problems <br /><br />• Provides techniques for
          developing your thinking and focus, overcoming fear, relaxing tension
          in your body, and developing a self-image more appropriate to who you
          are and aspire to be <br /><br />Ancient and classical societies have
          always had an ideal of manhood. In Japan, the samurai cultivated not
          only the art of the sword but also poetry, calligraphy, and spiritual
          practice. In Confucianism, the ideal man was the Chun-Tzu (the Higher
          Man), who cultivated both the arts of war and the arts of peace. And
          in medieval Europe, the knight lived by the comparable code of
          chivalry. Such men, considered both warriors and mystics, exempli ed
          wholeness. Yet today, men exist in a chaotic world without role
          models, guidance, or a sense of the sacred masculine.<br /><br />Exploring
          how to reconnect with the archetypal male ideal and develop the
          different sides of your being, author Angel Millar offers a journey of
          self-development to help cultivate yourself as a whole--mentally,
          physically, and spiritually. He examines some of the problems facing
          men in the world today--lack of strong friendships,
          distractingtechnology, constant criticism--and shares practices to
          develop yourself in the face of these problems. He shares techniques
          for enhancing your focus, overcoming fear, integrating your shadow,
          developing inner silence, and creating a self-image more appropriate
          to who you are and who you aspire to be. He also explores the
          importance of relaxing tension in your body to help you break free
          from pattern-induced behavior and self-defeating thoughts embedded
          through muscle memory.<br /><br />Examining in uential gures both
          contemporary and historical like Steve Jobs and Swami Vivekananda,
          powerful myths from East and West such as the tale of
          <i>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</i>, warrior and brotherhood
          traditions as well as literature and fine art, this guide will help
          you discover your inner sacred masculine, a better understanding of
          the world and your place in it, and ultimately how to become a
          confident, strong, and dynamic contemporary higher man and a leader in
          your own life.

          “Busting all categories and conventions, Angel Millar creates a new
          code of masculine development by uniting contemporary needs with
          esoteric wisdom to reintroduce honor, purpose, accountability, ethics,
          and effort into a culture that has astoundingly degraded or forgotten
          these ideals. As steeped in magic, rite, and hidden history as he is
          in good sense, Angel delivers the book on positive manhood for which
          our culture has been yearning. Cynics will never forgive him.”
