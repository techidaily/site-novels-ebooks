          Discover the Womb Rites and initiatory magic of Mary Magdalene, who
          was revered as a Priestess and human embodiment of the Goddess
          <br /><br />• 2020 Nautilus Gold Award<br /><br />• Reveals how Mary
          Magdalene was a sacred priestess of the ancient Womb Mysteries,
          connected to moon wisdom, sacred harlot archetypes, and goddesses in
          many traditions, including Sophia, Isis, Inanna, Asherah, Lilith,
          Jezebel, and Witches <br /><br />• Explains how the Magdalene
          Mysteries have been encoded in Gnostic texts, sacred art, and
          literature and unveils the secret Grail heresy of the
          <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i> <br /><br />• Offers rituals and practices to
          initiate you into the Womb magic of the ancient priestesses and access
          deeper dimensions of sexuality and feminine power <br /><br />A sacred
          priestess of the ancient Womb Rites, Mary Magdalene was at the center
          of a great and enduring Mystery tradition, one that touched on a
          stream of perennial spiritual wisdom as old as humanity. Worshipped as
          the human embodiment of the Goddess, the earthly Sophia, her womb was
          the spiritual luminatrix that anointed and empowered Jesus,
          transforming him into the Christ. As a priestess of the Goddess, Mary
          Magdalene knew how to embody the light and the dark, how to harness
          the magic potency of sacred sexual energy, and how to cleanse, awaken,
          and resurrect the soul. Yet, even though she sparked the creation of a
          worldwide religion, her story and teachings have been forgotten.
          <br /><br />Unveiling the lost left-hand path of the Magdalene, the
          Feminine Christ, authors Seren and Azra Bertrand explore how this
          underground stream of knowledge has been carried forward over the
          millennia through an unbroken lineage of Womb Shamans, Priestesses,
          Oracles, and Medicine Women. They explain how the Magdalene Mysteries,
          symbolized by the Rose, have been encoded in Gnostic codices and
          gospels and in the highest art, literature, and architecture of many
          ages, including most significantly the <i>Ghent Altarpiece</i>. They
          examine Mary Magdalene’s connection to moon wisdom, sacred harlot
          archetypes, and goddesses in many traditions, including Isis, Inanna,
          Asherah, Lilith, and Jezebel, and look at shamanic, tantric, and
          Cathar expressions of sacred feminine mysteries as well as the Witch
          and Templar roots of Robin Hood and Maid Marian. <br /><br />In this
          revelatory and magical text on the lost feminine mystery traditions of
          Mary Magdalene and the lineage of Sophia, the authors present
          encompassing theological, historical, mythological, and archetypal
          wisdom, with rituals and practices to initiate you into the Womb magic
          of the ancient priestesses and the path of the wild feminine.

          “<i>Magdalene Mysteries</i> offers a perfect combination of historic
          information across millennia along with the personal interactions of
          the authors with Mary Magdalene. It is a book to be read over time,
          allowing the information to seep in. It reads as a pilgrimage, and
          like all pilgrimages, time should be taken to allow the path to reveal
          itself to you, to allow yourself to open to revelations and notice the
          changes that occur as a result of the pilgrimage…It is a comprehensive
          introduction to Mary Magdalene to those new to the subject and also a
          deep-dive for those wanting a deeper interaction with Mary Magdalene.
          I highly recommend this book and encourage the reader to walk the path
          of pilgrimage to the Rose with these highly informed and passionate
          authors.”
