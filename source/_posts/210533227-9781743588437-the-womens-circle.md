              hosting women's circles with intention, purpose and meaning,
              making them a healing and empowering experience of
              gathering&nbsp;community.&nbsp;</b
            ><br /><br />A women's circle is&nbsp;a gathering of women in order
            to share, experience and relish in each other’s company. They are
            the ultimate ‘safe space’, a place where women can
            commune,&nbsp;open up and feel seen and heard.&nbsp;Sacred Space
            Holder Anoushka&nbsp;Florence invites you to reclaim the women's
            circle&nbsp;by exploring and remembering the true power of your
            feminine.<br />&nbsp;<br />Beautifully illustrated with full-colour
            photography,&nbsp;<i>The Women's Circle</i>&nbsp;is a practical and
            inspiring guide to hosting&nbsp;circles of your own.&nbsp;Including
            the history of circles, the importance of gathering, and steps
            for&nbsp;hosting 35 different rituals&nbsp;with the women in your
            life –&nbsp;a bridal blessing, mamahood blessing, memorial circle,
            new love circle, grief circle, sun circles, moon circles and circles
            to honour the change of season.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeking to revive, reclaim and remember the tradition of the women's
            circle,&nbsp;<i>The Women's Circle&nbsp;</i>will bring back to life
            this ancient feminine practice illustrating the benefits, healing,
            and magik that occurs when women gather.&nbsp;This is an opportunity
            for the reader to call in their community, gather and connect. Never
            has there been a more important time to rediscover the power of
            women’s circles.

          <b>Anoushka Florence</b> is a UK based author and founder of The
          Goddess Space. Inspired by her own spiritual journey, she went on a
          quest to create beautiful sacred spaces to support, hold, and empower
          women. Her work is based on ancient spiritual feminine practices that
          are grounded in the belief and knowing that the power to heal,
          manifest and live the lives we dream to live comes from within.
          Through her well-known women’s circles and online spaces, Anoushka
          reclaims and creates the opportunities for women to honour,
          celebrate&nbsp;and remember the rites of passage, the hidden meanings
          and the true power each woman can step into throughout her life.
          Anoushka’s deepest intention in her work is to help women remember.
          Anoushka offers women's circles, women’s circle training, one-to-one
          sessions, sacred online communities, pop-up events, as well as private
          ritual gatherings, including bridal/baby blessings. Having worked with
          companies such as Facebook and Vogue&nbsp;and travelled to the biggest
          festivals such as Wilderness and Wanderlust and overseas to spiritual
          bohemian havens such as Tulum and Sedona, her work has spread from her
          intimate living-room to pop-ups all around the world. Anoushka draws
          upon her ancestral wisdom, her life experiences and the spiritual
          teachings she has learnt along the way. She has trained over 800 women
          worldwide on how to hold their own circles too, committing to the deep
          intention of reclaiming the circle and restoring this ancient feminine
          practice to women. <b>The Womens Circle</b> is her first book.&nbsp;
