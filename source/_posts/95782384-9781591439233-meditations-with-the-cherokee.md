          • A collection of earth-centered meditations to enhance our connection
          to the natural world. <br />
          <br />• Reveals the Old Wisdom of the Cherokee elders for living in
          harmony with all beings. <br />
          <br />• Written by J. T. Garrett, of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, who
          was taught the ancient ways by his grandfather and other medicine men
          of his tribe. <br />
          <br />In a time before ours, humans could talk with animals, hear
          whisperings from plant life, and understand the origin stories written
          in the stars. Survival depended on active kinship with family and
          tribe, with four-leggeds and plant people, with sun and moon and fire.
          The Cherokee, known widely as the Principal People or the First
          People, hold a deeply tapestried collection of stories about human
          interrelatedness with nature. Those stories, passed down through
          countless generations of Cherokee, are especially significant at this
          time in human history, when Mother Earth suffers under the weight of
          unchecked "progress." <br />
          <br />As a boy, J. T. Garrett sat beside his grandfather and the other
          medicine men of his tribe as they chanted and drummed the stories of
          his ancestry. From those stories of Nu-Dah (the Sun), Grandmother
          Moon, Spring Rain, and Little Eagle comes this collection of active
          meditations for reconnecting with the natural intelligence that is our
          birthright. Recognizing that we are all kin in the Universal Circle of
          life opens us to communication with all beings, bringing us back to
          our natural spirit selves. If we listen carefully to the Cherokee
          stories of the Old Ways we can gain understanding of lost social and
          spiritual traditions that can help ensure a thriving future.
