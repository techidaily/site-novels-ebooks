            What if you could use cancer to evolve more fully into love?<br /><br />David
            Maginley has been there â€“ four times. His cancer led to a near-death
            experience and a career helping thousands face this disease. Through
            profound storytelling, David brings you to the core of the cancer
            journey to discover the hero within. In Beyond Surviving, you will
            learn how to:<br />- Turn the mind into an ally as you grapple with
            uncertainty.<br />- Improve spiritual health through your love,
            rather than your belief.<br />- Not only go through cancer, but grow
            through cancer.<br />Imagine becoming a warrior of compassion who
            uses cancer to forge meaning in suffering, heal the heart and
            amplify life. Beyond Surviving guides you to use the crisis for
            conscious creation of something even greater than survival.

          At his best, Maginley is breathtaking, writing powerful, deeply true,
          moving stuff. The result of his multi-faceted background is a uniquely
          grounded mix of pragmatism and deep spirituality, producing a book
          which has the makings of a classic. Highly recommended.

          "... a really lovely and unique book, filled with spiritual insights
          and obviously a work of love. David Maginley has beautifully conveyed
          the profound role a hospital chaplain plays in patient care, and done
          so with deep empathy because he's actually been there - on both sides
          of the veil! Masterfully created, informative, insightful and deeply
          engaging!"

          David Maginley infuses his sophisticated understanding of theology,
          philosophy, modern physics and consciousness research with a loving
          and compassionate concern for the many patients whose stories of
          living and dying he relates.
