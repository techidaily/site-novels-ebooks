          The perennial enigma the human mind has been encountering is the
          meaning of life and its place in the universe. On this subject,
          science and spirituality remained in discord with each other
          particularly for the last couple of centuries. The Theory of
          Relativity followed by quantum mechanics changed the worldview of
          traditional mindset altogether. The postulates of quantum physics
          paved the way for growing interest in philosophical spirituality.
          Theoretical physicist Fritjof Capra's book The Tao of Physics explored
          parallels between Eastern mysticism and modern science. Toshihiko
          Izutsu, in his book Sufism and Taoism, found similarities between
          Taoism and Muslim mysticism or Sufism. The book under review attempts
          to discover compatibility between Sufism and modern cosmology. It is
          basically a research book with more than seven hundred (700) citations
          of authorities of various disciplines, drawing from a vast array of
          diverse fields, such as physics, philosophy, biology, psychology and
          spirituality. The book probes into the nature and value of existence
          which ultimately leads to the direction of interconnection of the
          universe and human psyche; unity and integration of all things, and
          ultimately the unity of the whole universe and the whole person. These
          views are not placed on the shaky foundations of faith but they are
          based on philosophical logic and scientific facts--regarding
          importance of man as an observer in the universe, despite appearing
          insignificant on a point-like planet in the stunning vastness of empty
          space, and magnificent integration and harmony of the human psyche
          with the cosmos.<br /><br />These aspects of the book are unique in
          the sense that they amazingly reveal commonalities between physical
          and spiritual concepts and explain the phenomenon of existence as a
          compact whole in a coherent and logical sequence, with a glimpse of
          futuristic existence. This book may be of particular interest to the
          academia, research scholars, and students who may find the contents of
          the book unique and even startling.<br /><br />The author of the book
          is a research scholar from Pakistan who has been dedicated to
          exploring the reality of the physical world and human life. He has
          accentuated quite subtle and intricate issues in his book. His
          contribution to the relevant subject appears to have originality and,
          at times, remarkable distinction. The author believes that the
          contents of this book may not be found in any other single book
          published so far.
