            As most of the world went into COVID-19 lockdown, Marjie was
            determined to keep her spirits up the same way she always has--by
            writing. She began to share her thoughts, covering the emotional and
            subjective gamut on her Facebook page. Among other things, she
            investigated the development of a young hawk family growing up in a
            nearby tree; told about the experience of raising monarch
            butterflies; shared observations about her mother's descent into
            dementia; and relayed stories about her life lived in Canada and the
            United States.She did not realize how many of her friends were
            looking for encouragement from her writing until they started to
            chat about the postings and encouraged her to publish them. This
            former journalist had been writing to the published page for
            decades, but she hadn't been writing on Facebook from that
            perspective. After lockdown was over, she decided to publish
            portions.Here are just a few examples of her whimsical writing
            style:"Today, little wavelets of sadness were flittering by like the
            departing breath of someone's soul. I can, today, feel the fear, the
            grief that is out there but not yet right here.""If I hang around a
            house long enough, I don't get cabin fever, I come down with the
            Property Brothers virus.""When I developed a fever and started to
            shiver uncontrollably, we both cracked up at how my voice was
            shaking. We were like kids on the loose with helium.""It was a slow
            golf game. I glanced over and saw His Collarship unknowingly
            trailing a clump of Spanish moss. I called over, 'Game's so slow
            you've got Spanish moss growing on you.'""Thou shalt not have your
            computer below your head. I already see my own double chin more
            often than I'd like. If I wanted to see everyone else's, I would
            have become a cosmetic surgeon. My favorite view is the guillotine,
            where the chair is lower than the table and all you see on screen is
            this talking head, the body, apparently, still back in bed."
