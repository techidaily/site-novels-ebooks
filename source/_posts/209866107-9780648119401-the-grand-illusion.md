            The Grand Illusion (TGI) synthesizes the paranormal with today’s
            hard science, seeking to initiate a dramatic reempowering of
            humanity and a new direction for civilization. After reading, you’ll
            no longer consider yourself just a powerless little “meat computer”
            destined for total annihilation at life’s biological end; that
            outmoded worldview is firmly buried by the material set out within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, new and expansive vistas of possibility are laid bare; the
            forces and energies produced by our consciousness that act on the
            world around us are blown open for your understanding. Did you know
            that modern neuroscience considers the brain as a receiver of
            consciousness rather than the generator of it? Get ready for an
            introduction to the mysterious “fifth force” known to science—a
            virtually unshieldable “carrier wave” of consciousness that can
            travel at speeds far exceeding light.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the knowledge that we are incredible and immortal spiritual
            beings temporarily inhabiting a dream-like, multidimensional,
            holographic reality, we can indeed begin to turn life on this
            planet—which, for many, is a virtual nightmare—into The Grand
            Illusion.

            "A masterpiece. If The Grand Illusion were merely paradigm
            destroying, which it certainly is for rearguard scientific
            ‘Funda-materialists,’ it would be a satisfying read. Fortunately,
            for those of us dedicated to establishing a new civilization of
            consciousness, Brendan Murphy’s fascinating, inspiring and seminal
            work also opens the door to a world of new creative

          "I believe that your writing is even more important than your admirers
          realize&nbsp;because it can help to awaken the influential leaders who
          already know that we&nbsp;must begin immediately to build a new
          paradigm. That cannot happen without&nbsp;a revised understanding
          about the true nature of consciousness. I know of&nbsp;no one who is
          grappling with the problem at your level...I will be sharing
          your&nbsp;writing with others." -John Holum, M.S., B.A.

          "This is a rare find. So seldom do we find a single publication that
          covers&nbsp;consciousness and the overlap between science and
          spirituality from so many&nbsp;angles. Humanity needs more
          publications like this. If The Grand Illusion was&nbsp;a text book in
          our education systems, then the world would be a better
          place!"&nbsp;-Peter Smith, founder of the Institute for Quantum

          "Stunningly good. One of the best synthesis books on this sort of
          material I&nbsp;have ever read. Actually, no: it WAS the best. I've
          been re-reading it non-stop&nbsp;since finishing it the first time to
          soak more of it in. SO very well done. Can't&nbsp;wait for part 2."

          "Brendan Murphy has no doubt been synthesizing information for
          many&nbsp;lifetimes, and with The Grand Illusion, he knocks it out of
          the park. This is a&nbsp;brilliant compendium of evidence that
          unarguably demonstrates the existence&nbsp;of the implicate order -
          aka the aether, the source field, time-space, the zero&nbsp;point
          field, etc. - and how the (re)introduction of this aspect of reality
          into&nbsp;our cosmology presents a simple and elegant explanation of
          "paranormal"&nbsp;phenomenon such as remote viewing, distance and
          energy healing, and&nbsp;telepathy. Murphy arms the open-minded and
          disarms the skeptics, and goes a&nbsp;long way in the effort to erase
          the line in the sand of the science/spirit duality&nbsp;that in many
          ways defines (and contributes to the sickness of) our culture."

          "This young man is genius quality. No doubt about it. Skimming was
