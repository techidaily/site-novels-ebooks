            >For the millions who have enjoyed <i>Proof of Heaven</i>,&nbsp;
            <i>Heaven is Real</i>, <i>To Heaven and Back</i>, and
            <i>Getting to Heaven</i>, <i>Testimony of Light</i>&nbsp; is about
            life after death—and the amazing story of a friendship that endured
            beyond the veil—published for the first time in the United
            States.</b
          ><br /><br />Frances Banks died, as she had lived, fully aware of what
          she was experiencing and where she hoped to go. She was an Anglican
          nun for 25 years and for much of that time, the principal of the
          Teachers' Training College in Grahamstown, South Africa.&nbsp; She was
          the author of many psychological book. Her last book was<i>
            Frontiers of Revelation</i
          >, an account of research into psychic and mystical phenomena.
          <p>
            Her friend Helen Greaves was by her side as she finally lapsed into
            unconsciousness. Then, one evening some three weeks after Frances's
            death, Helen sensed her presence. This extraordinary encounter
            marked the beginning of contact between them from both sides of the
            veil—between life as we know it and life on "the other side."<br /><br /><i
              ><b>Testimony of Light</b></i
            ><b></b>is based on these communications that Helen received
            telepathically from Frances. The writings have been authenticated by
            those who knew them both and who were familiar with their individual
            writing styles. Moving and inspiring, this classic book is a
            testament to the enduring power of their friendship, and offers an
            important message to us all—that the death of the body is but a
            gentle passing to a much freer and fuller life.
