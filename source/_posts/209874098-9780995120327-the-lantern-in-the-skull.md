            Each of us is a conscious individual living in the world. Most daily
            experiences are predictable and humdrum. Occasionally we have a
            deliciously or shockingly intense experience. Very occasionally we
            have a profound experience that leads us to change our life. Then
            there are marginal experiences so bizarre we have difficulty
            understanding what occurred. The Lantern In The Skull explores a
            selection of these unsettling yet intriguing experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A camera previously in perfect working order,
            which inexplicably won't photograph a fetish in an African village
            chief's basement, provides the first stop on Hugh Major's engaging
            survey. Using his own experiences as a springboard, he considers
            telepathy, psychic perceptions, psychedelic insights, artistic
            transports, near death experiences, and much else.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Human consciousness is sufficiently elastic to
            accommodate all these experiences. Yet the nature of consciousness
            itself is a conundrum, and the evidence for marginal experiences
            remains contentious. Hugh Major provides a timely snapshot of
            current research into "marginal zones of the extraordinary". In
            precise, jargon-free language, he indicates the territory being
            explored and outlines major directions researchers are travelling.
            There are numerous captivating, and surprising, discoveries along
            the way.

          The Lantern In The Skull offers an engaging meditation on
          consciousness, that clear light that seemingly lives inside your head,
          stubbornly resisting materialistic explanations. Author Hugh Major
          provides a clearly written and well-informed study of the increasingly
          critical need to see beyond a simple clockwork model of reality. -
          Dean Radin PhD, chief scientist at the Institute of Noetic Sciences,
          author of Entangled Minds and The Noetic Universe
        </p>
        <p>
          Written in an engaging narrative style with impeccable literary skill,
          Major splices entertaining vignettes drawn from his own experiences
          with insightful analysis of our materialist culture in the West. The
          Lantern in the Skullchallenges the dominant worldview of materialism
          in which nothing exists other than the material world. What begins as
          simple and straightforward questioning of our psychic nature and
          abilities, unfolds into an intriguing feast. Serving as a primer, The
          Lantern in the Skull will appeal to those new to the terrain and to
          old hands like me who are well-read and well-experienced when it comes
          to the real realities of the metaphysical. A valuable book to gift
          those with an open mind. - Isobel Blackthorn, author of The Unlikely
          Occultist

          Of Hugh Major's previous book, From Monkey to Moth: An Imaginal
          Evolution:&nbsp;"Very readable, eclectic, full of wisdom drawn from
          experience. The ineffable is given shape with allegory, parable and
          metaphor. I so enjoyed it I went back several times to the sections
          that aroused a wealth of feeling." - Joy Cowley ONZ, DCNZN, OBE,
          author of Veil Over The Light: Selected Spiritual Writings&nbsp;and
          Navigation, A Memoir

        <p>READERS SAY:</p>
        <p>
          "The Lantern in the Skull opens the door to realms beyond the ego as
          it enquires into the essence of consciousness. Hugh Major deftly
          weaves ribbons of philosophy, metaphysical concepts and everyday
          mystical experience into an inspiring book that gives credence to the
          ordinary/extraordinary experienced by many, myself included." - Diana
          King
        </p>
        <p>
          "This turned out to be a thought-provoking read. A simple and clear
          writing style has been used to navigate this personal assortment of
          complex and diverse 'occurrences'. The result is intriguing." - Robert
          Gillies
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hugh Major, in this wonderful, thought-provoking book, describes
          moments in his life that have brought him to understand there is
          another dimension to reality. The information this book reveals will
          take you, if you allow it, to the other reality - one of joy and
          completion, immense satisfaction and, for me personally, relief. There
          is so much more to know. This book points us towards the next step in
          our evolutionary journey." - Mehda Austin
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hugh Major takes us along corridors in the mind, which we have
          visited and seen doors slightly ajar or shut. Memories of anomalies
          unexplained, usually kept private for fear of being ridiculed.
          Coincidences put down to nothing and not analysed because of "more
          important things to think about and do." This book makes you think and
          ponder. Get it. Read it." - Rebecca Wallis and Ross Lewis
        </p>
        <p>
          "A short book that delves into the subjective nature of our mind, and
          describes both personal experience and experiences drawn from others'
          testimonies, to expose another reality removed from the physical
          preoccupations of day to day life. Hugh Major's sharp perceptions make
          for an engaging and entertaining read." - David Cooke
