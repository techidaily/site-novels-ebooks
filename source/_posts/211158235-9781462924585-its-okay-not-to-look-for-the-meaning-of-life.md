            >Free Yourself from Stress with Simple, No-Nonsense Advice from a
            Zen Monk!</b
          ><br /><br />Zen monk Jikisai Minami takes the things we are supposed
          to strive for and turns them on their head. The 35 short,
          thought-provoking essays in this book are divided into four chapters
          about our sense of self, our hopes and dreams, our personal
          relationships and how to face death. Each essay begins with a
          deliberately controversial point of view to help us look at life's
          problems through fresh eyes. <br /><br /><b
            >Each chapter features a number of short, thought-provoking essays
            providing fresh perspectives on familiar problems that can change
            your life! The essays include</b
          >:<br />People Can Live Without Dreams and HopesYou Don't Have to Be
          "Who You Want to Be"When Your Head Is Full of Anger, Do Routine WorkDo
          Things for Yourself, Not for OthersIt's Natural for Life to Be
          NegativeIf It's Not a Life or Death Problem, You Can Handle ItPeople
          Can Be Saved Just by Speaking Their True FeelingsWanting Things
          Creates AnxietyIf You Grieve as Much as You Want To, the Time Will
          Come When You Can LaughA Person with Good Relationships Passes Away
          Beautifully<br />Although the author's messages may seem harsh at
          first, his teachings help us reduce anxiety in our daily lives. Being
          bound by the belief that "I have to do X" or "I need to achieve Y"
          causes immense stress. The author encourages us to accept our reality
          and live our lives from that starting point. This, he believes will
          free us from anxiety, relationship problems and negative emotions.<br /><br /><b
            >This book has been a huge hit in Japan, with reader comments such
            as:</b
          ><br />"I realized that I had made my life difficult by thinking,
          <i>I always have to be ambitious about my work</i>." (Female, age
          50)"I was deeply moved by the idea that
          <i>you don't have to find the meaning of life</i>. This is a book I
          cherish." (Male, age 34)

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Jikisai Minami</b> is a Zen monk and chief priest of the Reisenji
          Temple in Fukui Prefecture as well as head of the Osorezan Bodaiji
          Temple in Aomori Prefecture. In 1984 he decided to become a priest and
          entered Eiheiji, the head temple of the Soto sect of Buddhism, where
          he spent two decades training. After managing the Shishikurin Sanga
          training dojo for young priests, he began writing books discussing his
          relationship with Buddhism and his views on life.
          <i>It's Okay Not to Look for the Meaning of Life</i> is his most
          popular work to date, and the first to be translated into English.
