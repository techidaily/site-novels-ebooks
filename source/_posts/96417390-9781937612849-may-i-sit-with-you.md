          According to author Catton (The Mindful Addict), the practice of
          mindfulness can be summed up in a simple instruction: pay attention.
          Catton explains how meditation is designed to help people exercise
          living in the moment, let go of past hurts and future expectations,
          and offer a sense of serenity. The author guides readers through the
          most basic meditative ritual, such as focusing on breathing, and
          presents ideas for mindful walking, eating, and listening. Each of the
          67 short chapters can be read sequentially for meditation instruction
          or at random for inspiration.<br /><span>VERDICT:</span>&nbsp;Readers
          will be encouraged to incorporate these principles into their daily
          lives. The teachings will resonate with those in 12-step programs, who
          will find practical ways in which to use them. Among the best titles
          on this topic.—<b>Deborah Bigelow</b>, director emerita, Leonia P.L.,
