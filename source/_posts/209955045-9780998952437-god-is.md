            I write this book,&nbsp;“God&nbsp;Is”&nbsp;“The Gospel of Rev.
            Phil”&nbsp;not as a speculator or as a spectator; I write&nbsp;this
            book to document&nbsp;my experiences&nbsp;of the Great
            Mystery.&nbsp;“God Is” is a Spiritual journey not a religious
            one.&nbsp;I present this book as a gift&nbsp;of Grace&nbsp;to you,
            just as the spiritual experiences I share with you
            were&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift&nbsp;of Grace&nbsp;to me.&nbsp;Because of
            these experiences I am able to deal with life on life’s terms
            without the use of any mood or mind-altering
            substances.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have learned how to&nbsp;be of selfless
            service to my fellow spiritual beings. I believe each and every
            religion, theology and spiritual practice points its practitioners
            in that direction. I write&nbsp;this book for a number of
            reasons.&nbsp;One of those reasons is to transmit “The Gospel of
            Rev. Phil” (The Good News&nbsp;of Rev. Phil)&nbsp;which&nbsp;is to
            introduce you to an all-powerful, all-knowing, ever-present,
            unconditionally loving, non-judging Divine Presence. This
            Presence&nbsp;wants&nbsp;nothing but your greatest good to be made
            manifest in your life and works for&nbsp;that outcome.&nbsp;

          “GOD IS, by Rev. Phil Strom is a gift to all spiritual seekers. I
          found it a most helpful supplement to my own recovery from addiction,
          and it emboldened my commitment to pursuit of Spirit while
          illuminating my spiritual path. Regardless of one’s past history or
          religious tradition, GOD IS demonstrates human connection to the
          higher self and the loving, forgiving Divine in simple terms and in
          stories which will resonate with many.”<br />—John Bray-Morris M.D
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />“Rev. Phil once told me that we come into this world to identify
          our karma, and live through it in service, that we create our reality,
          and the rest is scenery.<br />He was right, you know.”<br />—Donathan
          Heimbecker, author of The Youngest Witness, a Memoir of Innocence and
          Retribution
        </p>
        <p>
          “Rev. Phil shares his journey of finding a spiritual solution to his
          disease of drug addiction… He also shares some of the teachings he has
          learned from spiritual masters through the ages as well as how the 12
          steps provided him with the tools and foundation to find recovery. The
          12 step programs of AA and then NA gave him a fellowship of
          like-minded travelers on his journey…<br />Today he seeks to share his
          recovery and his experience, strength and hope with addicts who are
          struggling with the disease of addiction.<br />In God Is, Rev. Phil
          shares his core message of seeking a spiritual consciousness and
          finding the God of your understanding…<br />In a paradoxical journey,
          he finds the solution to his addictions in finding God…”<br />—Steven
          Lustbader, M.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Rev. Phil, a friend and fellow pilgrim for nearly 20 years, has
          written a remarkable and courageous book. It turns out that God Is:
          And I Thought It Was All About Me, is really about us. It tells a
          story about a path so many of us have tread each in our own way and in
          our own experience from darkness to light, from suffering to
          redemption.&nbsp; Rev. Phil’s authentic honesty documents his walk
          through the dark night of the soul into the light of new life. Rev.
          Phil understands the power of grace and the presence of God in his
          life and shares it for us as a gift for our journey of self-discovery
          into the life of God in our lives.”<br />—Rev. Dr. Richard W. Murphy,
          Episcopal Priest
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />“No matter where you are in your life’s journey…a struggle, a
          fall, recovery, or a lull - this candid story by Rev. Phil will speak
          to you. GOD IS shows us how the presence of the Divine is with us at
          all times and how we can transform in spite of all odds. Read it
          now!”<br />—Shubhraji, author of In the Lotus of the Heart: The
          Essence of Relationships Founder, Namah Vedanta Center, Woodstock, NY
