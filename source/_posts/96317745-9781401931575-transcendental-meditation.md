            >Transcendental Meditation (TM) is a simple, natural method of
            allowing the mind to go beyond thoughts and gain access to the
            silent inner field of creativity, energy, peace, and happiness that
            is our own essential nature, our Self. </b
          ><br /><br />Widely known and prescribed by physicians for its
          powerful stress-reducing effects, TM is much more than that. Maharishi
          Mahesh Yogi (1918–2008), who brought TM to the West, said that TM
          offers any individual not only a gateway to the highest spiritual
          unfoldment (Enlightenment), but also "sound physical and mental
          health, greater ability in action, a greater capacity to think
          clearly, increased efficiency in work, and more loving and rewarding
          relationships with others." Five million TM practitioners around the
          world and more than 360 published, peer-reviewed scientific studies
          have consistently corroborated these lofty claims.<br /><br />Described
          as "a great book, by far the most comprehensive on the TM Program"
          when it was a bestseller in its original version, <b>Jack Forem</b>’s
          study of TM became a much-loved classic. This updated edition contains
          all the features of the original plus much more. <br /><br />Clear,
          easy-to-read diagrams explain scientific research showing TM’s
          beneficial effect on the brain and a broad spectrum of contemporary
          concerns, from health, self-actualization, and development of
          intelligence to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention
          deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and much more. <br /><br />In
          these pages:<br /><br />· Oprah Winfrey tells how she has offered TM
          to everyone on her staff.<br />· Dr. Mehmet Oz explains the benefits
          of TM for heart health.<br />· School principals describe the
          dramatically positive effect on their students when TM is introduced
          in the classroom. <br /><br />Interviews with celebrities as well as
          men and women of every age, background, and religion provide a lively
          testimonial to the efficacy of TM in making anyone’s life happier,
          healthier, and more creative.

          “In the ongoing transmission of India’s practical wisdom to the West,
          nothing has had a bigger impact than Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his
          Transcendental Meditation. This engaging and comprehensive update of
          Jack Forem’s seminal book is well timed, as the knowledge it contains
          is vital in our stressed-out, plugged-in era.”<br />—

          >“Jack Forem’s groundbreaking book, <i>Transcendental Meditation</i>,
          inspired thousands of people, including myself, to learn meditation
          and investigate the scientific basis behind its effectiveness. In this
          new edition, he brilliantly distills all the latest advancements and
          hundreds of scientific papers published in leading academic and
          medical journals. As Maharishi himself said about the original
          edition, this book ‘offers a clear, comprehensive, and thoughtful
          presentation of the essence of our teaching,’ and that is certainly
          true of this new edition as well. I strongly encourage everyone to
          read this book and to take full advantage of the programs it
          describes. It is an invaluable resource for all who desire a bright
          future for themselves and for our world.”<br />— <b>John Hagelin</b>,

          for Peace Featured in <i>What the Bleep Do We Know!?</i> and
          <i>The Secret<br /><br /></i>“A comprehensive, reader-friendly study
          of the teachings of a great modern master. Jack Forem’s book isn’t
          just about the TM technique and its massive body of scientific
          research, but it reveals practical and enlightened approaches to the
          fields of education, health care, personal relationships, psychology,
          religion, and business, and a novel and powerful strategy for
          achieving world peace. Informative and inspiring!”<br />—

          Director of Mental Health Centers in Chariton and Fairfield, Iowa<br /><br />“As
          a rabbi and longtime practitioner of the TM program, I particularly
          appreciate the new chapter on Religion and Spirituality in Jack
          Forem’s book. Jack quotes Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s teaching that
          religions have ‘one common ground: that the light of God is kindled in
          each heart.’ This is what TM accomplished for me in my life. I never
          would have desired to become, nor would I have been able to succeed as
          a rabbi,without the spiritual awareness that the practice of TM
          awakened in me.”<br />— <b>Alan Green</b>, Senior Rabbi, Shaarey Zedek
          Synagogue, Winnipeg, Canada <br /><br />“Many books have been written
          about the Transcendental Meditation technique and the array of
          benefits enjoyed by those who practice it. Jack Forem’s book stands
          out not only because it is eminently readable and entertaining, but
          because it is such a clear and comprehensive introduction to TM, the
          principles behind it, and the research demonstrating its
          effectiveness. It’s a joy to read and a breath of fresh air.<br />“In
          addition to delineating the value of TM for individuals, Forem
          explains cutting-edge, paradigm-shifting research showing that groups
          of people practicing TM together have significantly reduced tension
          and hostility in the environment. He argues persuasively that in TM,
          we have a technique to benefit the individual and at the same time
          generate harmony and reduce stress in society as a whole.&nbsp;This is
          a book to read and take to heart.”<br />—
          <b>Gary P. Kaplan M.D., Ph.D.</b>, Associate Professor of Neurology,
          Hofstra University School of Medicine<br /><br />“Jack Forem’s new
          book on Transcendental Meditation offers a wealth of research with
          real-world examples of how TM can increase personal and corporate
          success and effectiveness. This book offers numerous examples of how
          this simple technique has had a tremendous effect on people from all
          walks of life. I know it has helped me, my family, my company, and my
          clients.”<br />— <b>Nancy Slomowitz</b>, President &amp; CEO,

        <p>
          Jack Forem met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and learned Transcendental
          Meditation in late 1966. After studying with Maharishi in India in
          1970, Forem served as head of the TM center in New York and on
          Maharishi’s International Staff; taught training courses for TM
          teachers in Europe; led conferences and seminars on the development of
          creativity, leadership, and higher states of consciousness; and wrote
          a best-selling book on Maharishi and TM.
