            >Two leading spiritual psychologists offer a “life-changing book”
            that will help you awaken to your innate spiritual power and most
            authentic self (Jack Canfield, co-author of the
            <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>)</b
          ><br />
          <br />
          What if you discovered—not as a concept, but rather as a profound
          inner knowing born from the crucible of your own experience—that the
          <i>essence</i> of your very nature is, has always been, and always
          will be, the <i>presence of love</i>? That&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;would
          change everything. Your consciousness would be transformed, and you
          would move forward into a Soul-Centered life—your unique and beautiful
          life of meaning, purpose, and fulfillment.<br /><br />
          The book you hold in your hands is a vehicle for fostering just such
          an epiphany through the use of the empowering tools of Spiritual
          Psychology in your everyday life. As co-directors of the University of
          Santa Monica, the Worldwide Center for the Study and Practice of
          Spiritual Psychology,&nbsp;Drs. Ron&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mary
          Hulnick&nbsp;have had many years of experience in applying these
          principles and practices in their own lives as well as supporting
          thousands of students in doing the same. Their intention is nothing
          less than providing <i>you</i> with inspiration, practical tools,
          encouragement, and opportunities for learning how to live into the
          Spiritual Context—the awareness that you are a Soul and that your life
          serves spiritual purpose.<br /><br />
          As you read and engage with this book, you’ll learn practical ways
          for&nbsp;waking up&nbsp;more fully into the&nbsp;awareness&nbsp;of
          the&nbsp;loving being&nbsp;that you are. You will be remembering the
          Light within—remembering your&nbsp;essential nature. Can you imagine
          walking through this world in a consciousness that is Awake to Love?
          Wouldn’t that be amazing Grace? Opportunities for just such
          experiences are available to you, and this book will be your guide
          through this process.
