          <strong>LEARN TO MANIFEST YOUR HEART’S DESIRES<br /></strong><br />
          Growing Big Dreams is a passionate yet practical call to step through
          the gates of dreams and imagination to weather tough times, embark on
          travel adventures without leaving home, and grow a vision of a life so
          rich and strong it wants to take root in the world. Vitally relevant
          today more than ever, dreams are a tool available to all.<br />
          <br />
          Robert Moss is a cartographer of inner space, equally at home in
          Jung’s psychology and shamanic journeying. The compelling stories,
          playful activities, and wild games he provides are designed to lead
          you to manifest a life of creative joy and abundance. You’ll learn to
          connect with your inner imagineer and become scriptwriter, director,
          and star of your own life movies, choosing your preferred genre and
          stepping into a bigger and braver story. Great artists, mystics, and
          shamans know that there are places of the imagination that are
          entirely real. Moss shows you how to get there.

          “In Growing Big Dreams, Robert Moss skillfully magnetizes us back into
          the world of the shaman and the dreamer, the world of our magical
          inner child. Reminding us that the drought of dreaming characteristic
          of our everyday reality may be the cause of our many dysfunctions, he
          eases us into the twilight zone where synchronicities spring forth and
          treasures await. With all the allurements of a born storyteller, he
          urges us to hunt the dreams that are hunting us, to call soul back
          into our lives. Like a true lover, he sends us twelve gifts to teach
          us how to manifest our inner power and beauty. Just reading him is a
          joy, and this book is one more feather in the cap of a master teacher
          of dreaming.”<br />

          “Robert Moss is internationally known for teaching the power of the
          art of dreaming. In Growing Big Dreams he goes far beyond a typical
          book on the subject. He is a brilliant writer and an incredible
          storyteller, and you will find magic in this book: You will learn how
          to consult with your dreams to create your soul’s desire, how to
          travel through time, and aspects of the landscape of dreams that no
          other author has approached. . . . This is a remarkable book that’s
          deeply relevant to our times, giving us keys to remembering our soul’s
          purpose and living our bigger story.”<br />

          “A magnificent gift from a master of dreams. Robert Moss’s twelve
          secrets unpack a world of magic, showing us various ways to enter the
          healing world of our dreams. After my first reading, I followed the
          wisdom of Growing Big Dreams and was immediately rewarded with
          guidance from the dream world. I’m already rereading the book and
          recommending it to my friends and students. This is a book you’ll want
          on your bookshelf to refer to over and over again.”<br />
          <strong>— HeatherAsh Amara</strong
          ><strong>, author of The Warrior Heart Practice<br /> </strong><br />
          “An essential read for these times when we must reaffirm our dreams as
          oracles, our stories as valuable, and our imaginations as the fertile
          ground in which the future of our global collective is already being
          seeded. Robert Moss writes of our ‘dream drought’ as a pandemic and
          shows that where there is struggle and setback, there is also
          opportunity.”<br />

          “In Growing Big Dreams, Robert Moss shows why Einstein was correct
          when he famously declared, ‘Imagination is more important than
          knowledge.’ This splendid book is one of the clearest guides to
          unleashing the power of our imagination through our dream life. Our
          imagination is the gateway to creativity. To open the gate, let dream
          shaman Robert Moss be your guide.”<br />
          <strong>— Larry Dossey, MD</strong
          ><strong>, author of One Mind<br /> </strong><br />
          “A fascinating journey into the art of dreaming, Growing Big Dreams
          brings your inner imagineer to life. In this playground of intuition,
          you can discover new dimensions of yourself, along with the creativity
          and insight that can lead to real awakening.”<br />
          <strong>— Kim Chestney</strong
          ><strong>, author of Radical Intuition<br /> </strong><br />
          “Robert Moss’s books are full of good-sense reminders that our dreams
          are the road map for where we are and what vistas await. Frankly, we
          need this book right now when the whole world seems to be changing. .
          . . Moss has filled Growing Big Dreams with signposts to follow, a GPS
          of the inner realm, and maps to show us the way toward a possible
          future self.”<br />

          “Robert Moss is the ultimate dream guide for our time, with his deep
          knowledge of history as well as his incredible shamanic background,
          not to mention his own extensive travels to the far regions of this
          world many times over. In his latest work, he brings a complete gift
          to masterful dreamers as well as those who are new to the path of
          dreams. We need this book now more than ever.”<br />

          “With the warmth and ease of an experienced magic maker, Robert Moss
          weaves a spell that binds together stories, myths, synchronicities,
          and the secret desires of the soul as expressed in dreams. He invites
          us to explore the power of images and childlike play, grow our own big
          stories, and manifest our heart’s desire. A beautiful book that
          carries a much-needed vision of bright possibility during these times
          of global shift.”<br />

          ><br />
          “Robert Moss has a big, strong voice. He’s funny and deeply serious at
          the same time, erudite about a wide range of dream lore and dream
          practices. He shows that the way of dreams is a way of growth — how we
          grow from our dreams, how we grow into them, how we can grow bigger in
          heart than we’ve ever imagined — if only we learn to trust what we
          imagine.”<br />
