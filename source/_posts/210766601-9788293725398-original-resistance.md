            There is, perhaps, no more powerful archetype of female resistance
            than Lilith. As women across the globe rise up against the
            patriarchy, Lilith stands beside them, misogyny’s original
            challenger. This anthology—a chorus of voices hitting chords of
            defiance, liberation, anger and joy—reclaims the goodness of women
            bold enough to hold tight to their essence. Through poetry, prose,
            incantation, prayer and imagery, women from all walks of life invite
            you to join them in the revolutionary act of claiming their place—of
            reclaiming themselves.&nbsp;

          “Original Resistance is an inspiring collection of essays, stories,
          and poems centered around Lilith, a timely symbol of women’s
          resistance and self sovereignty. The diverse voices in this book
          create a powerful call to women to reclaim themselves and the spirit
          of Lilith, whose time has come.”

          “Everything my feminine soul has been thirsting for is contained in
          the brimming cup of this book. The Lilith archetype unleashes the wild
          heart, blows open the gates of the nondual mind, and blesses every
          cell of the holy, holy body. A fiery elixir of poetry and scholarship,
          myth and personal narrative, Original Resistance is a call to sacred
          action riding in on a wave of lovingkindness.”

          “The original warrior goddess: Lilith. This anthology shows the
          re-awakening of the major female archetype of resistance movement
          against the roots of patriarchy. Through these diverse voices, listen
          to the murmur of a revolution that lives in the hearts of all women
          and is now bursting forth in a roar.”

          “A rich anthology filled with essays, poetry, and art inspired by
          Lilith, the forgotten first woman of the Old Testament. Lilith’s
          original story is described in detail, and the personal stories shared
          by women remind us that we all need to meet Lilith, the first radical
          feminist to stand aside from the rules of the father God. Read this
          book and decide for yourself - is Lilith a dangerous outcast, or is
          she a much-needed companion for women who don’t take it lying down?”

          “Female resistance is dangerous. It is also necessary. For far too
          long the Western Judeo-Christian stigma of Eve as the downfall of
          humankind has served to oppress women, silence our voices, desecrate
          our power, annihilate our very existence.&nbsp;As an archetype of
          female strength and sovereignty, Lilith is the missing link in our
          spiritual mitochondria. Inviolable. Self-defining. Autonomous. She
          reminds us that we can, and must, resist any and all attempts to
          silence our voices, diminish our strength, erase our
          lived-experience.&nbsp;Original Resistance: Reclaiming Lilith,
          Reclaiming Ourselves&nbsp;is a veritable feast of artwork, poetry, and
          prose by visual artists and writers from a wide range of ethnicities,
          cultures, and countries around the world. It nourishes the soul and
          inspires us to embrace the wild beauty of our nature, and dance with
          abandon. Ultimately, it urges us to remember and reclaim our right—our
          duty—to resist all attempts to oppress and subvert our innate power.
          Like Lilith, it calls us to denounce the patriarchally-enforced
          feminine role of subservience, and restore our rightful place in the
          world.”

          “It’s lovely to see the ways in which the archetype of Lilith
          continues to speak to women from different cultures and traditions.
          The beautiful art in&nbsp;Original Resistance&nbsp;adds much to the
          written accounts of Lilith’s impact and meaning.”
