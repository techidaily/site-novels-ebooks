            There are two ways to live your life. The first is by default and
            the second is creating life by design. Both will take you to where
            you're going, although one tends to climb over rocks and boulders,
            through the desert and painful bracken and the other is much easier.
            It's the path of least resistance. Although it seems difficult, most
            people tend to struggle and follow the first path because they don't
            know there's another one. They live life by default which means they
            follow the patterns of the past that were adopted many years ago
            that may or may not work for them. It's not on purpose because
            nobody consciously chooses to struggle and live with disappointment.
            And it is changeable.
          </p>

          <p>
            The second path is the one we recommend. The 6 Dimensions of Healing
            helps you create a life by design to incorporate a deep
            understanding, self-empowerment, confidence, connection, self-worth,
            and happiness. It's a method of shedding the pain of the past along
            your journey and picking up new tools for happy, loving and lasting
            relationships. This is the difference between feeling unlucky and
            being in the right place at the right time. It's not luck, it's
            designed by you. And this book shows you how to do just that. Design
            a life you love.
          </p>

            You can use the 6 Dimensions of Healing which incorporates Physical,
            Mental, Emotional, Vibration, Intention and Attitude dimensions to
            help you discover the path to a really wonderful life. It just takes
            the knowledge and one small step at a time.

          I've known a lot of these concepts from the past but reading the 6
          Dimensions of Healing at this time and following their direction
          completely changed my life and the way I look at life. I no longer
          look at things through a dark lens but see them through the light. For
          the first time in many, many years I feel good about myself, I'm
          losing weight only because I'm no longer holding onto the things that
          made me swell up with emotion. For anyone who is looking for a way out
          of the end of the dark tunnel please invest yourself in the 6
          Dimensions of Healing Handbook and the freedom it will bring you. It
          completely makes a difference in how you see your world. I no longer
          live in fear, I'm able to do things that I didn't think I was ever
          able to do again and I'm getting back to being me again.
