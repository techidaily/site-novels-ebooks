            >Learn about the <i>bodhisattva</i> ideal—the capacity to see the
            potential for awakening in everyone and aspire to help them along
            their path—with new commentaries on early Mahayana sutras from Zen
            Master Thich Nhat Hanh, the monk <i>Time </i>magazine calls "the
            father of mindfulness."</b
          ><br /><br />Based on a three-month retreat given by Ven. Thich Nhat
          Hanh in the winter of 1991, this book gives an historical account of
          the emergence of the bodhisattva ideal during the first century CE,
          together with Thich Nhat Hanh's previously unpublished commentaries on
          two early Mahayana sutras—the Ugraparipṛccha Sutra (The Questions of
          the Householder Ugra) and the Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sutra (The
          Instructions of Vimalakīrti).<br />&nbsp;<br />About 150 years after
          the death of the historical Buddha, Buddhism had begun to develop into
          many separate schools, in which many monks came to prioritize their
          own personal liberation in their teaching and practice, while making
          Buddhism into a series of doctrines that served their own school. They
          came to live in a way that was cut off from other schools and from
          laypeople and saw laypeople as there primarily to make offerings and
          support the monks, not as practitioners who could also benefit fully
          from the Buddha’s teachings.<br />&nbsp;<br />Consequently, around the
          first century CE, there arose among lay and monastic practitioners the
          desire to popularize Buddhism and bring it out of the ivory tower and
          back in touch with life in the world, as it had been in the time of
          the Buddha. From this movement sprang the Mahayana path, which aimed
          to provide the deepest wellsprings of Buddhist thought to all people,
          regardless of their social background. Central to the Mahayana
          teachings is the idea of <i>bodhicitta</i> (the mind of love), which
          was personified in the <i>bodhisattva</i>, who sees the potential for
          enlightenment in everyone and vows to help them on their path to
          awakening.<br /><br />Soon Mahayana sutras began to appear,
          encouraging practitioners to develop the qualities of a bodhisattva in
          themselves. The Ugraparipṛccha Sutra counsels students on the
          bodhisattva path, giving practical instructions on how to help others
          suffer less. The Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa Sutra focuses on bringing the
          deepest teachings of Buddhism to ordinary people, with teachings on
          the ultimate dimension and Buddhist ethics. With his insightful
          commentary on these two important sutras, Ven. Thich Nhat Hanh
          continues the inclusive spirit of the early Mahayana practitioners.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Thich Nhat Hanh was a world-renowned spiritual teacher and peace
          activist. Born in Vietnam in 1926, he became a Zen Buddhist monk at
          the age of sixteen. Over seven decades of teaching, he published more
          than 100 books, which have sold more than four million copies in the
          United States alone. Exiled from Vietnam in 1966 for promoting peace,
          his teachings on Buddhism as a path to social and political
          transformation are responsible for bringing the mindfulness movement
          to Western culture. He established the international Plum Village
          Community of Engaged Buddhism in France, now the largest Buddhist
          monastery in Europe and the heart of a growing community of
          mindfulness practice centers around the world. He passed away in 2022
          at the age of 95 at his root temple, Tu Hieu, in Hue, Vietnam.
