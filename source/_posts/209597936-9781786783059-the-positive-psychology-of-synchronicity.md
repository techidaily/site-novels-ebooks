            mental-health practitioners, this book makes the strongest case yet

          ><br /><br />"A profound introduction to deep concepts of mind,
          meaning and the challenges of creating a life well lived for
          everyone." - Ernest Rossi, PhD, author of The Psychobiology of Gene
          Expression and Creating Consciousness<br /><br />Synchronicity is
          meaningful coincidence that connects our inner and outer worlds. This
          book reveals how it can guide us along our life path, helping us
          through challenging times and nudging us toward self-fulfilment.
          Psychologist Chris Mackey writes from personal experience, not only as
          a practitioner but also as a patient who has suffered serious mental
          illness. Formerly a rationalist with little time for non-scientific
          approaches, his own experiences and those of his patients have
          convinced him that synchronicity has a key role to play in helping us
          to tap into our intuitive and spiritual selves and guiding us through
          life. He now passionately believes that we need to embrace
          transcendent experiences and explore the opportunities for personal
          development offered by depression and states of mind that are often
          dismissed as psychosis. <br /><br />This exciting new approach to
          synchronicity and the treatment of depression and other mental
          disorders will be of great interest to practitioners and patients
          alike, as well as to anyone interested in the opportunities offered by
          altered states of consciousness. The book includes:
          <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Carl Jung's original
          description of synchronicity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Real-life
          case studies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Brain science<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>*</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Practical
          ways to work with synchronicity including journalling, symbol analysis
          and dream interpretation.

          “A profound introduction to deep concepts of mind, meaning and the
          challenges of creating a life well lived for everyone.” <br />– Ernest
          Rossi, PhD, author of&nbsp;<i>The Psychobiology of Gene Expression</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Creating Consciousness<br /></i><br />'I’m a huge
          fan of this book. Chris Mackey has blended his work on synchronicity
          with the field of positive psychology in a way that is informative and
          inspiring. Looking back, I’ve had many moments of synchronicity in my
          life’s journey – some after great triumph, others after great pain.
          This book has helped me to really understand what occurred and has
          taught me how to move forward in ways that will make better use of the
          future moments of synchronicity.&nbsp; As Mackey so eloquently says
          “There’s much to be gained from taking an optimistic perspective” and
          this book will help you do just that. Thanks Chris for your
          wisdom!'<br />-&nbsp;Professor Lea Waters (PhD),&nbsp;President
          International Positive Psychology Association&nbsp;<br /><br />Chris
          Mackey, a traditionally trained psychologist, explores his deeply
          personal journey, his own “hero’s journey” into the dark night of the
          soul. His exploration is richly sourced and offers a fine balance
          between providing sufficient explanations to make the profound
          mysteries of human experience accessible to even the most sceptical
          reader on the one hand, and on the other descending into the trap of
          explaining these mysteries away . . . he invites us to transcend the
          tired and limited attitude of “treating” mental illness, offering the
          possibility of Positive Psychiatry through synchronicity.<br />-&nbsp;Rob
