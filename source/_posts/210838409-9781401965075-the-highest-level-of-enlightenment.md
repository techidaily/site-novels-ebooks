            >In this profound book, based on a popular audio program, Dr. David
            Hawkins gives a primer on his world-famous map of consciousness that
            will help the reader embark on their own journey to an advanced
            state of consciousness.</b
          ><br /><br />Dr. Hawkins’s research is based on a well-established
          science called kinesiology, which has to do with the testing of an
          all-or-none muscle response stimulus. A positive stimulus generates a
          strong muscle response, and a negative stimulus results in a
          demonstrable weakening of the test muscle. Clinical kinesiological
          muscle testing as a diagnostic technique has been verified widely over
          the past 25 years.<br /><br />David Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D, conducted a
          29-year study that demonstrated that the human body becomes stronger
          or weaker depending on a person’s mental state. He created a scale
          from 1 to 1,000 that mapped human consciousness. Furthermore, he
          demonstrated that this map can be used as a blueprint to reach higher
          states of consciousness that can be identified simply by applying a
          small amount of pressure on an outstretched arm!<br /><br />Not only
          that, but this simple method has also been demonstrated to be an
          effective tool for instantly calibrating human consciousness. Dr.
          Hawkins created a scale of consciousness based on current discoveries
          in advanced theoretical physics and the nonlinear dynamics of chaos
          theory. And this “map of consciousness” now makes it possible for
          anyone to advance toward higher levels of enlightenment faster than
          ever imagined!<br /><br />In this book, you’ll learn how to:<br /><br />Advance
          your level of consciousness and your understanding of human behavior,
          just by learning the map of consciousness. Gain instant access to
          information that is beyond the capacity of all the world’s
          computers.Detect the exact point in any complex system where the least
          effort brings about the greatest result.Understand the power of a
          simple attitude adjustment as well as the consequences of various
          emotional states.Learn how people who calibrate high on the map of
          consciousness can raise the energy level and calibration of thousands
          of others just by being in their presence!Heal yourself of illness or
          addiction by reaching the state of consciousness in which it
          vanishes.Learn which foods, environments, companies, books, etc., are
          harmful (low energy) and which are beneficial (high energy).And much
          more!
