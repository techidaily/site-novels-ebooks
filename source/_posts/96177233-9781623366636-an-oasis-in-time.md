            >There is a surprising way out of the frenzy, that
            always-being-behind feeling, and the endless to-do list.</b
          ><br /><br />Now more than ever, people are seeking a reprieve from
          the constant pressure to achieve, produce, and consume. While many
          turn to sporadic bouts of mindfulness and meditation, organizational
          change specialist Marilyn Paul offers a complementary solution that is
          as radical as it is ancient. In her new book <i>An Oasis in Time</i>,
          Paul focuses on the profound benefits of taking a modern-day Sabbath
          each week for deep rest and nourishing renewal. The energy,
          perspective, creativity, sense of well-being, and yes, increased
          productivity that ensue are lifesaving.<br /><br />Drawing on Sabbath
          tradition, contemporary research, and interviews with scores of busy
          people, Paul shows that it is possible to introduce these practices
          regardless of your religious beliefs. Starting with just an hour or
          two, you can carve out the time from your packed schedule, design your
          weekly oasis experience, and most importantly, change your mind-set so
          you can enjoy the pleasure of regularly slowing down and savoring life
          every week. From surrounding yourself with nature to practicing
          rituals for beginning and ending oasis time to implementing strategies
          for connecting with friends and family, self, and source, you will
          discover practical ways to step off the treadmill and into timeless
          refreshment on your way to a calmer, richer, more fulfilling life.

          “If we don’t refuel, we run on empty. Marilyn Paul explores the power
          of respite and restoration—well-known in the ancient traditions of the
          world and confirmed by modern neuroscience—with heart, soul, and many
          practical suggestions. A distinctive and extremely useful book.”

              and Wisdom</i
            ></b
          ><br /><br />“At a time when many of us feel too busy to breathe, that
          our work is never done, and that the exhausting “everydayathon” of
          modern life will never stop, Marilyn Paul’s gentle and thoughtful
          <i>An Oasis in Time</i> shows there is a way out: taking dedicated
          time to pause weekly. Paul gives both practical guidelines on how to
          plan for regular time off, and shows how starting small, slowing down
          and keeping it simple can reconnect us with what’s most important and
          help us reclaim our souls.” <br /><b

          ><br /><br />
          “Is there any human tradition more beautiful and enduring than the
          sabbath? In this engaging and thoughtful book, Marilyn Paul explains
          why this ancient practice is in the midst of a revival and how it can
          transform your life. In a breathless, screen-driven world, everyone
          needs an oasis in time—this is your guidebook.”<br /><b

            <i>Hamlet’s Blackberry: Building a Good Life in the Digital Age</i
            ><br /></b
          ><br />“We all know it’s a good idea to take a break from work, but
          how many of us actually do it? The practical advice in Marilyn Paul’s
          new book is precisely what we need to close the gap between what we
          know we <i>should </i>do, and what we <i>actually</i> do. The proof?
          It’s Friday evening and I’m turning off my computer for the
          weekend.”<br /><b

              Right Things Done</i
            ></b
          ><br /><br />“Too often an oasis seems an unattainable mirage. Marilyn
          offers wise, practical steps to finding and protecting your own place
          of healing, peace, and renewed connection—with ourselves and those we
          love. An invaluable voice for survival in today's 24/7 hyper-connected
          world.”<br />

          ><br /><br />“Marilyn Paul makes a compelling case that an ancient
          ritual can vastly improve your quality of life in a hectic modern
          world. I'm convinced!”<br /><b
