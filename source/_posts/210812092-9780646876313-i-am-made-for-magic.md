          <p>
            As the Sages, Gurus, and Master Teachers of the past have known, all
            permanent outside change must start from the inside, that special
            place where you really know yourself.&nbsp;You are more powerful
            than you think, you have magic!
          </p>
          <p>
            This book and the practice within can help facilitate this beautiful
            inner change. You will be able to do this with little effort, and
            with no more than your desire to grow and be a more beautiful,
            loving, and accepting person.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will find your relationships improving, the stresses that come
            every day are not so important, and your wherewithal an absolute
            abundance of positivity and generosity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, you will find a user-friendly, self-directed, personal
            practice that has the power to dissolve psychological and emotional
            pain while dissolving the underlying cause of that pain!
          </p>
          <p>
            Written by a retired psychologist with 30+ years' experience in
            addressing past trauma and proven results to heal, grow, enjoy, and
            start loving life again.&nbsp;Relax while you learn a simple
            practice to improve your life, become more insightful, and let go of
            that difficult past that has been holding you back.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we change what is occurring in our thoughts, feelings, and
            underlying beliefs, we change the world. As it is the world has
            changed and suddenly, listening to Thich Nhat Hanh or Jon
            Kabat-Zinn, subscribing to Mindvalley, attending Gabrielle
            Bernstein, Eckhart Tolle, or Tony Robbins rallies, or practicing
            Yoga in the park may not be quite enough. The world is thinking
            differently, feeling differently, and behaving differently. Many
            have learned to ignore the feelings of fear and uncertainty by
            replacing them with distractions, medications, social drugs, and
            power-control thinking. Combining scientific research, teachings
            from the masters, practical examples, and down-to-earth
            guidance,&nbsp;I Am Made for M.A.G.I.C.&nbsp;provides the reader
            with a personal practice to be used anywhere, and anytime. Each
            practice brings powerful results. Combining the five practices
            provides an exponential effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            M.A.G.I.C. is an acronym for five practices
            -&nbsp;meditation,&nbsp;appreciation,&nbsp;grounding,&nbsp;insight,
            and&nbsp;connection.
          </p>
          <p>
            M is for meditation. Mindfulness meditation is engaged here to calm
            the mind, relax the body, and excite the spirit. By dissolving any
            resistance, we open to the flow of abundance in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            A is for appreciation. Appreciation floods your heart with the
            energy of joy, in acceptance with thanks. It allows us to find value
            in everything, even when we cannot explain it, or we do not want it.
          </p>
          <p>
            G is for grounding. Grounding connects the energetic system of your
            body with the energy system of Mother Earth. This connection with
            our planet is a connection between living, breathing, and conscious
            entities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I is for insight.&nbsp;Insight opens you to your higher guidance. It
            is intuition, inner knowing, and guidance all in one. It allows the
            voice of your inner being to be heard by you, even if it is via
            someone else's lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            C is for connection. Connection recognizes and appreciates the
            trillions of cells that make you a living, breathing, conscious
            being along with the wisdom of your heart. The practice of
            connection is your unseen relationship with all the people in your
            life, all of life on this planet, and, the Spirit that is all of
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            M.A.G.I.C. as a practice integrates these five practices into one
            and it can be done in 30 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with an explanation and demonstration for each of the five
            practices, there are hundreds of gems to nurture any reader's thirst
            for deepened spirituality. With little extra effort, in fact, with
            less effort than you are now expending, you can engage five
            practices, the same five practices the self-growth industry and the
            global spirituality movements are based upon. Being able to do this
            in 30 seconds allows you to use it many times every day and
            especially in times of crisis
