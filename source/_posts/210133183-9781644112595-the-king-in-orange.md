          • Details the magical war that took place behind the scenes of the
          2016 election <br /><br />• Examines in detail the failed magical
          actions of Trump’s opponents, with insights on political magic from
          Dion Fortune’s war letters <br /><br />• Reveals the influence of a
          number of occult forces from Julius Evola to chaos magick to show how
          the political and magical landscape of American society has
          permanently changed since the 2016 election <br /><br />Magic and
          politics seem like unlikely bedfellows, but in
          <i>The King in Orange</i>, author John Michael Greer goes beyond
          superficial memes and extreme partisanship to reveal the unmentionable
          realities that spawned the unexpected presidential victory of an
          elderly real-estate mogul turned reality-TV star and which continue to
          drive the deepening divide that is now the defining characteristic of
          American society. <br /><br />Greer convincingly shows how two
          competing schools of magic were led to contend for the presidency in
          2016 and details the magical war that took place behind the scenes of
          the campaign. Through the influence of a number of occult forces, from
          Julius Evola to chaos magicians as well as the cult of positive
          thinking, Greer shows that the main contenders in this magical war
          were the status quo magical state--as defined by the late scholar Ioan
          Couliano--which has repurposed the “manipulative magic” techniques of
          the Renaissance magi into the subliminal techniques of modern
          advertising, and an older, deeper, and less reasonable form of
          magic--the “magic of the excluded”--which was employed by chaos
          magicians and alt-right internet wizards, whose desires coalesced in
          the form of a frog avatar that led the assault against the world we
          knew. <br /><br />Examining in detail the magical actions of Trump’s
          opponents, with insights on political magic from occultist Dion
          Fortune’s war letters, the author discusses how the magic of the
          privileged has functioned to keep the comfortable classes from being
          able to respond effectively to the populist challenge and how and why
          the “Magic Resistance,” which tried to turn magic against Trump, has
          failed. <br /><br />Showing how the political and magical landscape of
          American society has permanently changed since the 2016 election
          cycle, Greer reveals that understanding the coming of the King in
          Orange will be a crucial step in making sense of the world for a long
          time to come.

          “Against a humorous and informed survey of the American political
          landscape, Greer analyzes the 2016 U.S. presidential election through
          the lens of magic. Taking his cue from Ioan P. Couliano’s
          masterpiece<i> Eros and Magic in the Renaissance</i>, Greer shows the
          power of symbols in forming popular opinion and political action and
          with it the competing and combating views of magic of the two
          principal parties: the magic of the privileged versus pragmatic
          positivism and where they meet in the Faustian dream of perpetual
          progress. An essential book for anyone seeking to understand the
          direction in which ‘cancel culture,’ the industrial world, and its
          formerly liberal democracies are heading.”
