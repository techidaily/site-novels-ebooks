          “If you have ever watched in envy those people who seem to operate
          from a clear sense of inner knowing (what Paul O’Brien calls
          <i>intuitive intelligence</i>) and consistently manifest their dreams,
          envy no more. In his exciting new book, O’Brien lets the reader in on
          the power of Visionary Decision Making and shows exactly how to
          harness that inner guidance that intuitively ‘knows’ the elegantly
          effective ways to proceed, whatever your endeavors, and is, moreover,
          aligned with the greater good.”
