            Beautiful Women: A View from the Heart contains inspiring, real-life
            stories of women who've helped another person - or many others - to
            uniquely change their life for the better. Each story is told by an
            inspired individual, about a woman who demonstrates "love-based
            values," but who has generally not received recognition for their
            inner beauty.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Just weeks before deciding to write this book, Charlie held his
            newborn daughter in his arms for the first time. He thought about
            the world that she was about to enter. It was at that very moment
            that he knew - for her and every other innocent person like her - he
            needed to leverage all his skills and abilities to help make this a
            safer and more beautiful world to grow up and live within.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Charlie's hope is that readers will discover how these love-based
            values can be adopted to create new value for others. Readers may
            embrace this book as an opportunity to see in how many different
            people, and ways, and situations, this inspiration can occur. And in
            learning that, many readers will be inspired to take similar actions
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            You will love Beautiful Women if you have begun to lose hope that
            this torn world can ever be mended. You will love it even more if
            you're open to the inspiration that you can be a source of that very
            same beauty in the world - not just a part of the solution, but a
            leader of it.

          ourselves."

          stories told by those whose lives were touched by their demonstration
          of 'love-based values.' These incredible women inspire us all to find

          share this same theme." -
