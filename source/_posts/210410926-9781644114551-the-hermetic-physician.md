          • Explores Kremmerz’s life, his teachings, his work as a hermetic
          physician, and the metaphysical and hermetic principles that guided
          his activities <br /><br />• Offers a detailed account of the distance
          healing practices, diagnostic methods, and rituals of the Fraternity
          of Myriam <br /><br />• Includes texts written by Kremmerz on the
          inner workings and magical operations of the fraternity, intended for
          its practicing members <br /><br />Giuliano Kremmerz (1861-1930), born
          Ciro Formisano, was one of the most influential Italian occultists,
          alchemists, and Hermetic masters of the late nineteenth and early
          twentieth centuries, though he remains almost unknown to English
          readers. In 1896, Kremmerz began writing about natural and divine
          magic, healing, and alchemy through the journal<i>
            Il Mondo Secreto</i
          >
          (The Secret World). At the same time, he founded a school known as the
          Schola Philosophica Hermetica Classica Italica as well as a magical
          group, the Therapeutic and Magical Fraternity of Myriam. Within the
          Myriam, he sought to use Hermetic, magical, and Pythagorean principles
          to harness the power of the psyche and convey collective energies for
          therapeutic purposes and distance healing. His initiatic order would
          become the principal esoteric society in Italy--comparable to its
          British counterpart, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn--but forced
          to be a carefully guarded secret as Mussolini’s government rose to
          power. <br /><br />In this unique compilation of essays, David Pantano
          presents an in-depth study of Kremmerz’s life and work by his student
          and initiate, Italian esotericist Marco Daffi. Without holding back
          criticism, Daffi provides a detailed account of the history and
          practices of the Myriam as well as the metaphysical and Hermetic
          principles that guided their activities. Revealing Kremmerz’s
          rediscovery of the occult healing of ancient mystery schools, Daffi
          also shows how Kremmerz laid the foundation for passing this
          initiatory tradition on to the new millennium. He explores the means
          by which Kremmerz said miracles can be performed and the way Hermetic
          forces affect both bodily health and mystical eroticism.
          <br /><br />Throughout this collection, David Pantano provides
          extensive annotations, offering the English reader essential
          historical and mystical context for Daffi’s work. Connecting to
          untranslated Italian texts and elucidating Daffi’s poetic style,
          Pantano’s commentary reveals the particular tradition of Italian
          esoterism. Pantano also includes rare and unpublished texts written by
          Kremmerz and intended for the Myriam’s practicing members. Combined,
          these papers offer a picture of the inner workings and magical
          operations of this fraternity, available for the first time in
          English.

          “Giuliano Kremmerz was one of the most important figures in the
          Italian Hermetic tradition in the early twentieth century but
          heretofore has received little attention in the English-speaking
          world. The translator, David Pantano, is to be congratulated in
          spreading awareness of Kremmerz to a wider audience and helping to
          shed light on his intriguing system of Hermetic medicine.”
