            >Dissolve hurtful patterns and emotional hardship through the five
            yogic points of suffering, or kleshas.<br /><br />Includes powerful
            and practical meditations, mantras,&nbsp;asanas, reflection
            questions, and more, to reduce our suffering—and the suffering of
            others.</b
          ><br /><br />We all get stuck in hurtful patterns that continue to
          create more suffering in our lives. In yoga philosophy, these patterns
          are known as the five kleshas. In this wise, practical guide, Michelle
          Cassandra&nbsp;Johnson offers us a path toward developing a deeper
          understanding of them and how they hijack us emotionally.<br /><br />The
          five kleshas are: ignorance (avidya); overidentification with ego
          (asmita); attachment to desire or pleasure (raga); aversion or
          avoidance (dvesha); and fear of death or letting go (abhinivesha).
          Each one leads us to create tendencies and karma that move us away
          from realizing and remembering our true nature and seeing ourselves as
          separate from one another and the planet. In yogic terms, this
          perpetuates a constant cycle of pain for us all.<br /><br />Readers
          will learn to:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;deepen their connection with
          self and others;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• look at their relationship and
          attachment to pleasure and aversion to discomfort;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;•
          notice more fully how their&nbsp;actions affect others;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;meet
          each moment as it arises and ride the waves of life as they come;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;and
          much more<br /><br />Johnson offers us a way to find a sense of
          clarity, groundedness, and equanimity within ourselves by working
          through the kleshas one-by-one using asana, pranayama, mudra,
          mantra,&nbsp;reflection questions, and meditation.

          “The demand for healing tools has never been greater in these critical
          times. <i>Illuminating Our True Nature</i> provides a comprehensive
          framework for connecting with ourselves through yoga. This profound
          work guides us toward personal healing and illuminates a path toward
          healing on a collective level, making it an essential resource for our
          current moment.”<br />—<b>Dianne Bondy</b>, author of
          <i>Yoga Where You Are</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />“Through her deep philosophical&nbsp;study and sharing of
          vulnerable lived experiences, Michelle Johnson offers meaningful tools
          for understanding and&nbsp;navigating the <i>kleshas,</i> afflictions
          that cause&nbsp;suffering, while steering the reader back to the path
          towards liberation.”<br />—<b>Tejal Patel</b>, yoga teacher,
          podcaster, community organizer<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “With remarkable generosity, Michelle Johnson equips us with the
          essential tools to take deliberate and compassionate action,
          facilitating positive change not only within ourselves but also within
          our communities and the broader world. This is an important book that
          should be read by anyone seeking liberation and desiring that same
          liberation for all.”<br />—<b>Seane Corn</b>, author of
          <i>Revolution of the Soul</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In this immediately useful book, Michelle serves as a compassionate
          guide to help you alleviate your personal suffering. When you do that
          work, you can then remove obstacles to our collective
          liberation.&nbsp; Her approachable writing explains what could be
          opaque and inaccessible in clear language that will directly help you
          to help yourself—and everyone around you.”<br />—<b>Sage Rountree</b>,
          PhD, E-RYT500, author of <i>The Art of Yoga Sequencing</i> and
          <i>Teaching Yoga Beyond the Poses</i><br /><br />
          “Michelle Cassandra Johnson offers a powerful and unique perspective
          on the kleshas— five poisons rooted in ignorance that obscure the mind
          and close the heart. She asks us to consider not only how they cause
          suffering in our own lives, but how they contribute to systems of
          oppression. Her wise and compassionate counsel, coupled with practices
          of deep reflection, is the medicine we need to bring us home to our
          true nature and, in doing so, work toward the liberation of all
          beings.”<br />—<b>Linda Sparrowe</b>, author of
          <i>The Women’s Book of Yoga and Health</i> and <i>Yoga Mama</i>
