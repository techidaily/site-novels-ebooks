          Kabbalistic initiatory teachings for becoming a vessel for
          illumination, prophecy, and peace by creating an inner dwelling place
          for God’s divine presence <br />
          <br />• Reveals practices for self mastery and revelation based on the
          holy design of the first Hebrew Sanctuary, the lives of the Hebrew
          Prophets, and the Tree of Life <br />
          <br />• Shows how the Tree of Life’s ten sefirot correspond to the
          Torah’s prophetic Ten Songs of Creation; to alchemical ritual
          practices of fire, water, air, and earth; and to specific parts of the
          body, emotions, and aspects of the soul <br />
          <br />Many synagogues and churches, including the First and Second
          Temples of the Hebrews, follow an archetypal design first used in the
          <i>Ohel Moed</i>, or Tent of Meeting, and its sacred Tabernacle, which
          housed the Ark of the Covenant and the Ten Commandments. Drawing from
          a wealth of sources including the Hebrew Bible, the oral Mishnaic
          tradition of Judaism, and 16th-century Judaic texts, Zohara Hieronimus
          explains how, like the <i>Ohel Moed</i>, we are designed to receive
          and reflect the divine qualities of the Creator. <br />
          <br />Exploring the kabbalistic initiatory teachings within the
          Chassidic tradition of Judaism and the lives and writings of the
          Hebrew prophets, she reveals how our physical and spiritual worlds are
          not separate but interdependent, one affecting the other, often in
          unexpected and sometimes miraculous ways. Examining the ten-part
          system of Kabbalah’s Tree of Life as reflected in the holy design of
          the Hebrews’ first Sanctuary, Hieronimus shows how the Tree of Life’s
          ten sefirot correspond to the Torah’s prophetic Ten Songs of Creation;
          to alchemical ritual practices of fire, water, air, and earth; and to
          specific parts of the body, emotions, and aspects of the soul.
          Starting from Malchut (Kingdom) at the bottom of the Tree of Life and
          ascending to Keter (Crown) at the top, the author discusses related
          biblical and scholarly texts and traditional Hebrew practices and
          teachings that can lead to spiritual enlightenment, illumination, and
          peace, allowing each of us to become a sanctuary for God’s presence
          through self-refinement, ritual devotion, and prayer, as practiced
          since biblical times.
