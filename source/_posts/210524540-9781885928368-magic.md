            Words are means by which people communicate, and the words can
            constitute a language. To communicate, you have to have an
            under¬standing of the words you use and that is where the problem
            arises. The meanings of most of the words we use were learned in
            context with other words, and from this we assume that we know the
            meaning of a word. When you do this, and your understanding of a
            word is the same as its real meaning, no problem arises. However,
            when what you assume the meaning of a word to be does not agree with
            the true meaning of the word, then misunderstanding is the result.
            It is most rewarding to understand the true meaning of words. The
            best sources for obtaining this information are dictionaries,
            encyclopaedias and dictionaries in other languages.

            As an example, the word “principle” is often used. Have you ever
            looked it up in a dictionary to find out if your understanding of
            this word is the same as what it really means? Many times, of
            course, your understanding is correct, but be certain to avoid
            misunderstand¬ing. When you read this book, your understanding of
            all the words are of the utmost import¬ance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The meaning or meanings of the word “principle” include: 1. Chief;
            2. Beginning; 3. the Ultimate Source; 4. Origin; 5. The Law of
            nature by which a thing operates; 6. An Essential Element…..

            Many people in the old days believed in spirits, demons, angels, and
            so on. Even today some believe in this, while others do not.
            Primitive civilizations believed that thunder, storms and rain were
            caused by the gods. One question, however, always remains
            unan¬swered. In a laboratory experiment, ingredients have to be
            combined to achieve certain results. In a laboratory, this is done
            by people. Who does it in nature? These questions and more are all
            addressed by Karl von Eckartshausen (1752-1803) because universal
            truths and principles are timeless and do not change from century to
            century.
