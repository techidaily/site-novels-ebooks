            >Use the power of life force to live your highest potential with
            this “landmark book” that addresses “the role of the chakras in
            personality and our intimate relationships” and “opens the door to
            the inner experience of the authentic self” (Peter Levine, author of
            <i>Waking the Tiger</i>)<br /></b
          ><br />We all know what it’s like to have a “charge” about something.
          It’s a feeling of excitement, fear, sexual arousal, or irritation. But
          what we don’t currently know is how to <i>use</i> charge for the
          behaviors we want to create.<br /><br />Charge is a word for the basic
          life force running through us. This force is crucial if we are to meet
          the challenges of difficult situations, heal past wounds and traumas,
          and manage the stress of modern life. Even more, it is essential for
          understanding how to master your own life force and become all you can
          be.<br /><br />This book makes an important contribution to the
          growing field of Energy Medicine, by looking at <i>charge</i> as the
          interface between mind and body, and the missing ingredient in
          Mind-Body healing. It brings the reader into a deep intimacy with
          their own life force, as well as an understanding of how charge runs
          their relationships, their children, their clients, and patients. It
          examines how we can become “overcharged” or “undercharged” and how to
          bring about balance through practices of charging and discharging.
          Each chapter gives simple exercises to put these principles into
          practice.<br /><br />World-renowned teacher, somatic therapist,
          best-selling author, and advanced yoga teacher,&nbsp;Anodea Judith,
          Ph.D., addresses all this and more in her groundbreaking book on
          mastering the life force. Taken from her decades of teaching on the
          subject and her doctoral work in Mind-Body medicine, this book
          contributes something entirely new to the literature on healing self
          and others.

          “Anodea Judith’s <i>Charge and the Energy Body</i> takes you on a
          beautiful journey through the subtle energies that animate your body.
          Based on a lifetime of curiosity and creative exploration, it will
          help you understand your own workings, the forces that propel those
          you love, and how to stabilize and harmonize the energies within you
          and beyond you. I recommend it highly.”<br />

          “In this landmark book, Anodea Judith further addresses the role of
          the chakras in personality and our intimate relationships. She
          advances her original understanding of the energy systems of life and
          shows us just how we can ride the wave of charge and excitement and
          embody that aliveness. This journey opens the door to the inner
          experience of the authentic self, of our relationship to ourselves and
          to others. Anodea also pays particular attention to the effect that
          trauma has upon our vital energy centers. She then provides maps to
          help us move back into life, and to know and achieve what we truly
          want in life.”<br />

          “Everything is possible. And the key is in your charge and the energy
          body. When your charge blends with its source, the universal charge,
          you have arrived home. That power is within your grasp. In her book
          <i>Charge and the Energy Body</i>, Anodea gives us a complete,
          original, and fresh insight into the possibility of living an
          orgasmic, ecstatic, and joyful life-physically, emotionally, and
          spiritually. Read this book, and you'll have the key to Heaven!”<br />

          healing. With her foundational practices, we can become better human
          beings and agents of positive change.”<br />

          the 'must-have' books for body-oriented and energy-oriented
          health-care professionals. Her focus on 'charge' as an energetic
          phenomenon provides a nonjudgmental language and point of view that
          can be used easily by therapists and accepted by clients. She provides
          a wealth of information about different patterns of charge with
          different types of problems, as well as how to shift those patterns.
          The book provides plenty of exercises that can help therapists and
          their clients experience and embody different ways of being. I highly
          recommend this book."”<br />

          Anodea Judith has given us a new way of looking at human behavior and
          emotion during trauma, healing, and self-regulation. If you want a
