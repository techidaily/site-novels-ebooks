            ><i>Learning the Tarot</i>, Joan Bunning offers a complete course in
            19 lessons that covers the basics and then gradually goes into more
            advanced concepts.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          First published in 1998, Joan Bunning’s<i> Learning the Tarot </i>has
          become a tarot classic. Written in a confident and natural style, the
          book communicates the basic depth and beauty of each card, shows how
          the cards trigger psychological projection, and enhances intuition.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>Learning the Tarot</i> is a thorough (but never
          overwhelming) invitation to the beginner. The book focuses in detail
          on:<br />
          &nbsp; the actual process of discovering meaning in the cards how to
          consider one card by itself, how to look for card pairs how to create
          the "story" of a reading &nbsp;<br />
          The book includes a convenient reference section that contains two
          pages of information for each card, including a picture from the
          popular Waite-Smith deck, a description, keywords, action phrases, and
          suggestions for cards with similar and opposite meanings.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The author first presented this course online at
          <i>learntarot.com</i>, which continues to attract over one hundred
          thousand visitors per month. “When I first created my website in
          1995,” writes Joan Bunning, “I never dreamed how much interest in the
          tarot I would find. People from all over the world began writing to
          tell me about their experiences with the course and their adventures
          with the cards. This response was music to my ears! I knew from my own
          experience that the tarot is a wonderful tool for personal guidance
          and inner exploration.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “My goal with this book was to give you the basics you need to begin
          working with the tarot on your own. I try to make this inner process
          understandable by breaking it up into a series of steps that are
          simple while still doing justice to the depth and beauty of the cards.
          I concentrate on the everyday, showing how the tarot makes real,
          practical sense in the modern world. The tarot is a living system that
          adapts creatively to each user. Rather than rules, I offer guidelines.
          While reading my book, I want you to feel that you have a teacher
          sitting next to you who is introducing you to this special tool, but
          also encouraging you to go on to discover your own unique approach to
          the cards.”
