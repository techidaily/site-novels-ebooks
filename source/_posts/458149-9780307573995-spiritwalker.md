            >"I am about to tell you a most unusual story, a chronicle of
            something that happened to me while I was living on the flank of an
            active volcano on the island of Hawai'i.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a scientist.
            I mention this because I do not feel that I was in any way
            predisposed for what was about to occur. In fact, my scientific
            training would seem to have preprogrammed me against such an
            experience</i
          >." -- From <i>Spiritwalker</i><br /><br />The astonishing true story
          of an anthropologist's quest into a spiritual world of magic,
          mysticism, and meaning. <br /><br />Not since Castaneda's tutelage
          under the Yacqui Indian guide Don Juan has there been a spiritual
          autobiography quite like <i>Spiritwalker.</i><br /><br />Hank
          Wesselman's incredible story of a series of encounters that would
          forever change his life began with what he at first tried to explain
          away as particularly vivid dreams, but which grew increasingly intense
          and insistent, ultimately propelling him on twelve fantastic journeys
          across time and space. Over the next three years, his journeys proved
          to be far more important than mere reason could explain. Eventually,
          Dr. Wesselman became convinced that he'd been granted a visionary
          encounter with what tribal people from millennia past have called the
          "spirit world."<br /><br />
          During his epic travels,&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Wesselman met shape-shifting
          entities, spirit helpers, and guardians, and found himself traversing
          a mental, physical, and<br />spiritual landscape on a path
          intersecting that of a fellow traveler, a Hawai'ian kahuna mystic
          named Nainoa. Five thousand years into the future, Nainoa had been
          sent by his Chief on a journey into what used to be America, a
          once-powerful land of machines and magic, from which no previous
          voyagers had ever returned. What did Nainoa seek from Dr. Wesselman?
          What did the anthropologist have to learn about his own world from
          this exotic traveler from another time and place? Together, scientist
          and mystic are initiated into knowledge of non-ordinary levels of
          reality and given foreshadowings of imminent environmental, political,
          and spiritual challenges to their civilization.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without
          abandoning his scientific objectivity, Dr. Wesselman abandoned himself
          to the mystical, sometimes frightening, yet always luminous
          experiences that brought him beyond the boundaries of ordinary
          consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is a fascinating and suspenseful
          adventure, an exciting and important archeological discovery, and the
          story of how a hard-headed scientific-realist stumbled on an important
          piece of the puzzle of human evolution.<br /><br />
          Socially urgent and disturbingly prophetic, <i>Spiritwalker</i> has a
          universal mythic resonance and an undeniable relevance for today as it
          challenges our<br />perceptions of our world, our reality, and our
          future.
