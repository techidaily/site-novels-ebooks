            >Beloved author and teacher Alan Cohen (A Course in Miracles Made
            Easy) uses his insightful spin on spiritual wisdom to show that we
            can enjoy significant career and financial success and be true to
            our passion and soul's calling.</b
          ><br /><br />Can you create material success and keep your spirit
          alive? Is it possible to combine prosperity with purpose and passion?
          Can you sell your product without losing your soul?<br /><br />Expert
          coach and beloved teacher Alan Cohen demonstrates the answer is yes.
          In <i>Spirit Means Business</i>, he identifies--and then
          dismantles--the 10 primary illusions that keep us from connecting
          spirituality and prosperity. To name a few:<br /><br />If you want to
          succeed, you have to suffer first<br />There's only so much to go
          around<br />Competition is healthy and necessary<br />To do well in
          your work, you must give up your life<br />In each case, Alan shows us
          how to replace the illusion with a higher truth, using principles that
          always work when we apply them consciously. You'll learn from
          down-to-earth examples of individuals who have combined soul and
          success, and you'll find crisp, clear formulas to bridge the gaps and
          surmount the hurdles along the way.<br /><br />Drawing on wisdom
          sources from the Tao Te Ching to <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, as well
          as stories from Alan's clients and his own life, this book will help
          you navigate a spiritually sound path to the success you desire.

          “<i>Spirit Means Business</i>&nbsp;is as fun to read as it is
          enlightening—essential reading for anyone committed to success in
          their personal and financial lives. Alan reminds us that we can both
          achieve the things that we want and be our authentic selves. The
          wisdom he has gathered from his own life experiences is the real
          deal.”<br />—&nbsp;<b>Ken Honda</b>, Japan’s all-time best-selling
          business author<br />​<br />“<i>Spirit Means Business</i>&nbsp;teaches
          us that our desire for spiritual evolution and business success are
          not in conflict with one another. As Alan Cohen beautifully reminds
          us, they’re linked in a powerful way.”<br />—&nbsp;<b>Mike Robbins</b
          >, author of&nbsp;<i>Bring Your Whole Self to Work</i><br /><br />“I
          love this book! Alan Cohen has gotten inside our heads, exposing that
          the illusions we’ve learned to relate to as truth about money,
          sacrifice, and success aren’t rooted in reality at all!&nbsp;Spirit
          Means Business&nbsp;is a powerful and practical guide through the maze
          of these myths, providing a path to prosperity with integrity at the
          core.”<br />—&nbsp;<b>Nancy Levin</b>, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Worthy:&nbsp;Boost Your Self-Worth to Grow Your Net Worth</i
          ><br /><br />“Alan Cohen is one of my favorite teachers. He somehow
          manages to be both super<i>&nbsp;</i>mellow&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;super
          no-nonsense intense. In&nbsp;<i>Spirit Means Business</i>&nbsp;he
          helps us achieve what we all really want: how to prosper wildly (!)
          without selling our souls. I loved the book and highly recommend
          it—especially if you’ve wondered how to integrate your spirituality
          and your ambition. I believe the world needs more of us spiritually
          minded people to become&nbsp;<i>much</i>&nbsp;more economically
          empowered so we can change the world together. I think this book is a
          great resource for the movement.”<br />—&nbsp;<b>Brian Johnson</b>,
          CEO of Optimize and creator of&nbsp;<i>Philosophers’ Notes</i
          ><br /><br />“In&nbsp;<i>Spirit Means Business</i>, Alan Cohen dispels
          the myths of hardship commonly associated with professional
          advancement and awakens the reader to an alternate reality where the
          air is fresher, the colors more brilliant, and the money flows. As an
          entrepreneur and business coach, who transformed from working very
          hard to succeeding with ease, I highly recommend this insightful book.
          It is a blessing for any entrepreneur or professional who feels the
          call for greater joy, passion, and profitability in their business.
          Listen to his immense wisdom, self-examine with his lessons, and watch
          your life become lighter and more joyful and for you to prosper with
          greater ease.”<br />—&nbsp;<b>Roberta Ross</b>, president of
          www.SixFigureRealEstateCoach.com and host of&nbsp;<i
            >Free Yourself to Success Podcast</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Spirit Means Business</i>&nbsp;will be a welcome and
          inspiring answer to anyone seeking to integrate their spiritual path
          with their profession. I wholeheartedly resonate with the values,
          visions, and techniques that Alan Cohen suggests and encourage you to
          explore its far-reaching, healing, and effective ideas.”<br />—&nbsp;<b
