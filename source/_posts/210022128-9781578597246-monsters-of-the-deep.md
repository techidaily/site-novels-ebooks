          <p>
            Water takes up 70 percent of Earth’s surface, with countless lakes,
            rivers, ponds, streams, seas and oceans covering much of the land,
            but what lurks beneath the water? For centuries, sightings have been
            made of huge, marauding monsters swimming the world’s oceans and
            lakes. They include Scotland’s legendary Loch Ness Monster; the
            United States’ equivalent, Champ, of Lake Champlain; and Canada’s
            long-necked denizen of the deep known as Ogopogo. These, and many
            more, famous monsters of the world below us also include giant
            squid, massive octopi, and even the fabled Kraken and the fabled
            mermaids of millennia long-gone. Possibly, too, there survive
            populations of marine reptiles that were assumed to have gone
            extinct millions of years ago, in the Jurassic period, such as the
            plesiosaur.

            Whether scaly or slithery, massive prehistoric dinosaurs or mutant
            serpents, <b><i>Monsters of the Deep</i></b> catalogs nearly 100
            accounts of eels, alligators, reptiles, giant squids, snakes, worms,
            deadly fish, and cold-blooded creatures of all manner and ilk. It
            reveals the astonishing extent to which lake monsters and sea
            serpents have surfaced throughout history to terrify, perplex, and
            amaze those who have crossed paths with these monsters of the
            unknown.

            Master storyteller, established author, and respected expert on the
            unexplained and paranormal Nick Redfern sifts through the historical
            record, first-person accounts, and unearthed government files on
            lake monsters and sea serpents to tell of encounters with a variety
            of beasts, including ... Cheever Felch’s 19th-century account of the
            massive Gloucester, New England, Sea Serpent The brontosaurus-like
            Mokele-Mbembe of the Congo The supernatural Bunyip, a monster that
            lurks within the creeks, lagoons, and swamps of Australia that has
            been known to the Aboriginal people for centuries The disputed
            claims of Teddy May, former Commissioner of Sewers in New York, of
            alligators roaming the sewers of the city The monster-sized fish in
            the River Nene, in the Fens, Cambridgeshire, England Modern mutants
            genetically altered by pollution And many more!

            This richly researched reference overflows with fascinating
            information to make you think about—and reconsider—dipping your toes
            into water. With more than 120 photos and graphics, this tome is
            nicely illustrated. <b><i>Monsters of the Deep</i></b> also includes
            a helpful bibliography and an extensive index, adding to its
            usefulness.
