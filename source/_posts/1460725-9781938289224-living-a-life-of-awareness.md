          For the first time ever, the Toltec wisdom from the Ruiz family is
          bound together in a book of Daily Meditations.&nbsp;<br /><br />Readers
          are invited on a six-month journey of daily lessons with don Miguel
          Ruiz Jr. that are designed to inspire, nourish, and enlighten
          adherents as they travel along the Toltec path.&nbsp;<br /><br />Drawing
          on years of apprenticeship under his father and grandmother, don
          Miguel Ruiz Jr. shares Toltec lessons on Love, Faith, Agreements, and
          most importantly: Awareness. The purpose of each meditation is to
          guide readers into a deeper understanding of his or her self, as well
          as the world in which we live.<br /><br />In the introduction to the
          book, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. reminds readers that progress on the Toltec
          path is not measured by the acquisition of things, status, or even
          ideas, but rather the complete and total realization that everything
          in the world is perfect, exactly the way it is at this moment.<br /><i
            ><br />“Love is accepting ourselves just the way we are, with all of
            our flaws and our ever-changing belief system. You are nothing else
            but who you are. You are not the person you were a year ago. You are
            not the person you will be in a year. You aren't even the person you
            think you are. You simply are, and that must be enough.</i
          >” —don Miguel Ruiz Jr.&nbsp;<br /><br />This book will have special
          appeal to those already familiar with his father’s books&nbsp;<i
            >The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love</i
          >, and&nbsp;<i>The Fifth Agreement</i>, as well as don Miguel Ruiz
          Jr.’s own book,&nbsp;<i>The Five Levels of Attachment</i>. It also
          makes a wonderful gift.

        <p>
          "Whether he’s talking about Letting Go of Perfection, Following Your
          Heart, Taking Off the Mask, or Living Your Life as a Work of Art, don
          Miguel Ruiz’s son speaks from the heritage of Toltec wisdom that was
          passed on to him by his grandmother and his father. He not only
          learned the lessons well, he has made them his own. In this book of
          short lessons and meditations he puts the wisdom into his own
          heart-felt words in a way that truly brings them into daily life. The
          message of the book — that everything in life is interconnected and is
          perfect in the moment — is very similar to that of Buddhist
          mindfulness practice. There is an earthy quality in the way Ruiz
          expresses those ideas that makes this book of daily meditations
          particularly comforting." –<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>,&nbsp;<i
