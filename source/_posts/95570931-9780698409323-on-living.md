            ><br />A hospice chaplain passes on wisdom on giving meaning to
            life, from those taking leave of it. </b
          ><br /><br />
          As a hospice chaplain, Kerry Egan didn’t offer sermons or prayers,
          unless they were requested; in fact, she found, the dying rarely want
          to talk about God, at least not overtly. Instead, she discovered she’d
          been granted a powerful chance to witness firsthand what she calls the
          “spiritual work of dying”—the work of finding or making meaning of
          one’s life, the experiences it’s contained and the people who have
          touched it, the betrayals, wounds, unfinished business, and unrealized
          dreams. Instead of talking, she mainly listened: to stories of hope
          and regret, shame and pride, mystery and revelation and secrets held
          too long. Most of all, though, she listened as her patients talked
          about love—love for their children and partners and friends; love they
          didn’t know how to offer; love they gave unconditionally; love they,
          sometimes belatedly, learned to grant themselves. <br /><br />
          This isn’t a book about dying—it’s a book about living. And Egan isn’t
          just passively bearing witness to these stories. An emergency
          procedure during the birth of her first child left her physically
          whole but emotionally and spiritually adrift. Her work as a hospice
          chaplain healed her, from a brokenness she came to see we all share.
          Each of her patients taught her something about what matters in the
          end—how to find courage in the face of fear or the strength to make
          amends; how to be profoundly compassionate and fiercely empathetic;
          how to see the world in grays instead of black and white. In this
          hopeful, moving, and beautiful book, she passes along all their
          precious and necessary gifts.

          world, where ordinary people face death with wit, humor, sadness, and
          regret. Egan reveals that the job of a chaplain is mostly to listen to
          them as they work out how to set things right with those they love,

          “It's a brave thing to walk into the rooms of the dying with no
          props--to sit down, open your heart and your mind, and be present to
          whatever comes up. But that's exactly what chaplain Kerry Egan does,
          and in <i>On Living</i>, she reveals some of what she has learned.
          What does come up? Anger, love, regret, secrets, stories, and
