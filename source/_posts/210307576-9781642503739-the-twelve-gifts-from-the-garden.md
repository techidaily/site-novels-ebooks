            >The author of <i>Opening the Gifts</i> shares essays inspired by
            nature and the life lessons she learned while pausing to reflect
            during rough points in her life.</b
          ><br /><br />
          During a tropical storm. In the aftermath of chemotherapy. Amid
          marital discord. These are among the times author Charlene Costanzo
          found comfort, joy, hope, and healing in Sanibel Island’s botanical
          garden. She also learned a few things. Eventually she amassed a
          collection of wisdom from these experiences and now, she shares these
          insights with you.<br /><br />
          If you look closely, plants sprout with willpower and bloom with
          determination. Drawing from the beautiful nature of trees and flowers,
          Charlene crafts garden-inspired messages from her experiences with
          healing and understanding. Inside, find quotes, reflections, and even
          bonus material: Pen-and-ink line drawings with illustrations of
          flowers, leaves, and garden plantsCharlene’s
          <i>Twelve Gifts</i> resource and lessons learned in the gardenAn
          epilogue from two other locales: Sedona, Arizona, and St. John in the
          U.S. Virgin Islands<br />
          Each gift-from-the-garden message asks readers to imagine walking in
          the author’s sandals—or at least by her side—and try to perceive as
          she did. The journey is sometimes whimsical, often idealistic, and
          always encouraging. Charlene hopes that this book will ultimately
          enrich and empower readers as they journey through life in their own
          shoes.<br /><br /><b>Perfect for readers of Anne Morrow Lindbergh</b

          “For this reader, the whole of the book cannot be consumed in one or
          two sittings. Reading a few of the essays, and taking time to think
          about them, is enlightening. Admittedly, some spark recognition of my
          life and experiences more than others. I suspect though, that I will
          return to many of them more than once, as life, flora, and fauna
          change daily. Especially in 2020, this is a resource for mind,
          character, spirit, and love. We can all use life lessons for peace and
          tranquility.”<br />—<i>Santiva Chronicle</i>

          “Charlene takes us on a journey with delightful stories of wisdom,
          trust, and forgiveness in <i>The Twelve Gifts from the Garden</i>.
          Stopping and listening inwardly, she attunes to the wisdom of the
          plants, trees, and gardens she encounters on a small island off the
          coast of Florida. The beauty in the silence and the wisdom received
          from attuning to nature points us to the beautiful gift of life
          itself. Charlene’s book is lovely and insightful.”<br />—Drs. Ron

          “Reading&nbsp;<i>The Twelve Gifts from the Garden</i>&nbsp;brought me
          to a state of deep peace with a greater sense of well-being. Although
          I have not been to the botanical garden on the island, I have visited
          Sanibel several times. Between my own experiences on that sanctuary
          island and Charlene's descriptions, which I found to be reverent,
          vivid, and whimsical, I felt virtually transported into the garden
          that inspires her. Her stories resonated with my own, stirred my hope
          and wonder, and inspired me to more deeply appreciate the natural
          world. What I find most satisfying in her writing is how she weaves
          together the qualities she sees in plants, with the natural resources
          in us, and her own life experiences in a way that comforts, uplifts,
          and encourages readers to pay attention to Mother Nature. Charlene, as
          did the ancient ones in the wisdom traditions, encourages us to take
          lessons from nature, to look beyond first impressions, to engage in
          the felt experience of how nature feeds, enriches, and nourishes us.
          Charlene helps us to think in a more contemplative way. She will
          inspire you to notice what resonates within you, to listen and feel
          for your own insights when visiting the green places around you. Her
          life-affirming messages are timeless and timely. This is a book I'll
          be gifting to others.”<br />

          &nbsp;“<i>Twelve Gifts from the Garden</i>&nbsp;is a joyful read
          bursting with the beauty of nature and reflections of lessons learned
          in life. I have been a fan of Charlene Costanzo’s daily emails and
          books for many years. Most mornings, reading her reflections gives me
          goosebumps because they are like having a cup of coffee with God. They
          are what I would imagine God would be saying to me in that moment
          because Charlene's reflections would be in line with what I prayed the
          night before. This is a wonderful book to gift yourself and
          others!”<br />—Gina La Benz, author of&nbsp;<i

          guide through inner and outer landscapes filled with meandering paths,

          black butterflies, beautyberry plants, pom pom palms—and, most

          accounts of the blessings that she has gleaned from her journey move
