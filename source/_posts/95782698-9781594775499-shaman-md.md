          A highly successful plastic surgeon embraces shamanic healing
          techniques and helps her patients experience true beauty and
          ecstasy.<br /><br />• The author has been featured by
          <i>Healthy Living</i> magazine as one of the top 19 holistic healers
          for the millennium.<br /><br />• Shows readers how to embody the
          spiritual within the physical to shapeshift their lives on all
          levels.<br /><br />• Both an exceptional personal journey and an
          extraordinary exploration of the nature of real healing.<br /><br />As
          a dual board-certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon
          <i>and</i> the first non-Quechua woman to be initiated into the Circle
          of Yachaks (bird-people shamans of the Andes), Dr. Eve Bruce sees
          herself as an agent of change in both worlds. <br /><br />After
          traveling to Central and South America to study indigenous healing
          techniques, Bruce realized that although our culture is obsessed with
          narrowly defined standards of physical beauty, we actually devalue the
          physical because we separate it from the spiritual. She saw that her
          plastic surgery patients who felt ashamed of their "vanity" had the
          least successful outcomes. Those ready for change on emotional and
          spiritual levels were able to use the physical "shapeshift" provided
          by the surgeon's knife to transform their entire lives. By integrating
          the two healing modalities of surgeon and shaman, Bruce is able to
          help people shapeshift into newfound health on all levels--physical,
          emotional, and spiritual. <br /><br />Because she bore her first child
          at sixteen, rose to the challenges of single motherhood, and worked
          her way through medical school, Bruce learned early to redirect the
          flow of her life, turning apparent obstacles into opportunities. As a
          powerful example of the human capacity for self-transformation, Bruce
          is uniquely qualified to inspire readers to redirect their own lives
          to places of beauty and self-acceptance.
