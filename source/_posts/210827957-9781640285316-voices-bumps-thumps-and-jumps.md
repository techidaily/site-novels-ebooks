            There are many questions in life that seem to go unanswered. Are you
            hurting after you have gotten saved? Are you wondering why your life
            has not changed? Are you watching the world zoom by without you?
            Perhaps you see others live a glorious life; they are not saved, but
            you are saved and serve Christ with all you got, but nothing never
            seems to bless you. You ask why your world feels like it is ending
            instead of beginning? Have pastors or other leaders told you that
            your life was going to turn around after you got saved, but you are
            not seeing instant results? Maybe someone prophesied that you were
            going to come out of financial difficulties, but you are deeper in
            or that your marriage was going to get better and it ended up in
            divorce. All the promises you have heard became empty and futile.
            Are you waiting for a husband or wife from God for years and still
            nothing? Are you having trouble with your family or children? All
            the questions that you ask and seek why your life has not changed.
            Patricia Tidmore does not have all the answers, but the Holy Spirit
            has revealed many of the answers.

            Although every family or individual is different, God has a unique
            purpose for everyone. He is, right now, constructing you and molding
            you into a special person to be a blessing for many others. If you
            are willing, He can change your world into a phenomenal world.
            Question after question will be answered to its fullest if you are
            willing to stay in the fight. The devil would have you believe that
            God has left you and that He is a liar, but it is the devil who is
            the liar. God is truth, and He has an interesting way of teaching
            you. Patricia prays that you will hear the voice of God clearly so
            that you can be lead into your sole purpose in freedom. To lead you
            in your unique purpose. To bless you with liberty. If your life as a
            Christian has been chaotic, it is time for it to stop. May you be
            delivered and healed from voices that are not from God, from disease
            and sickness, from evil and wickedness, from poverty, stress, sexual
            perversion, and many more demonic oppression. God wants to set you
            free and that time is now!
