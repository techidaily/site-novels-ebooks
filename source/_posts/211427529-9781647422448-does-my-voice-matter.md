          We live in a critical and oftentimes violent world. People are afraid
          to talk about what they feel, think, or believe. They withhold energy
          for fear of being ridiculed, punished, or excluded. They hide their
          deepest dreams and desires away and cover them up with doubt,
          insecurity, old experiences, and fears. Cynthia James know
          this—because that was her experience. <br />
          Covering seven decades of living, traveling, and growing,
          <i>Does My Voice Matter?</i> follows James’s journey of self-discovery
          and authenticity as she gradually recognizes that she has a voice—and
          learns how to use it. She uses her own life experiences as a backdrop
          for her exploration of how the voice is used as a tool of engagement;
          how a singular or collective voice can enhance empowerment,
          transparency, and accountability; and, finally, how expression can
          develop new ideas, shift cultures, political views, transform
          organizations, create laws, and improve lives. <br />
          Written for anyone who wants to discover the power within that makes
          them special, <i>Does My Voice Matter?</i> has a vital message:
          Uniqueness is your own glorious imprint on this planet, and it is
          calling you to come out. It doesn’t matter if your awakening is large
          or small, it doesn’t matter what your age, race, religion, or history
          is—anyone can begin right where they are, right now.
