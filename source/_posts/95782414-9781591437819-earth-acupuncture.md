          Applying the principles of Chinese medicine and Native American
          shamanism to answer the call of the Earth and heal its polluted
          landscapes<br /><br />• Explains how to build a healing relationship
          with the natural world by making offerings of thanks and listening to
          the Earth’s responses<br /><br />• Details methods of diagnosis and
          several types of Earth acupuncture treatment, including building stone
          circles, planting crystals, and working with wooden and copper-rod
          needles<br /><br />• Shares the author’s journey of healing a river
          with these methods<br /><br />After experiencing a powerful vision of
          the nuclear power plant near her home and its toxic effects on the
          Hudson River, acupuncturist Gail Rex was inspired to help heal the
          river and surrounding lands but was unsure how to begin. Soon after,
          at a workshop with Cherokee-wisdom teacher Venerable Dhyani Ywahoo,
          she discovered the answer: she could treat the landscape just as she
          treated her patients--by taking its pulses and treating the points of
          stagnant energy and pollution with acupuncture.<br /><br />Tracing her
          journey from initial vision and pulse taking to building a stone
          circle to open a major energy meridian of the Hudson, the author
          reveals how our rivers, valleys, and forests are capable of illness
          and healing just like a living being. She explains simple practices
          for attuning with the living landscape and responding appropriately to
          the messages and images received from the Earth’s intelligence. By
          making offerings of thanks and asking the land’s permission before
          every interaction, Gail Rex demonstrates the power of right
          relationship in action.<br /><br />Drawing upon the principles of
          Chinese medicine and her work with Native American shamanic
          traditions, Rex shows how the landscape itself reveals both its
          imbalances and the opportunities for treatment. Using a broad range of
          diagnostic tools--including direct observation, principles of feng
          shui, listening to pulses, and working with maps--she demonstrates
          ways of identifying the master points of the surrounding landscape.
          She then explores different methods of Earth acupuncture treatment,
          including building stone circles, planting crystals, and working with
          wooden and copper-rod needles to treat these specific points and
          restore energy balance.<br /><br />Offering not only a proactive
          method for healing the environment, Rex also reveals how to
          communicate with the rivers, mountains, trees, and rocks that surround
          us, allowing each of us to develop an authentic spiritual relationship
          with the living body of the Earth.
