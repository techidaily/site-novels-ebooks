          Since the mid-1950s, the psychoactive compound DMT has attracted the
          attention of experimentalists and&nbsp;prohibitionists, scientists and
          artists, alchemists and hyperspace emissaries. While most known as a
          crucial component of the “jungle alchemy” that is ayahuasca, DMT is a
          unique story unto itself. Until now, this story has remained untold.
          <i>Mystery School in Hyperspace</i> is the first book to delve into
          the history of this substance, the discovery of its properties, and
          the impact it has had on poets, artists, and musicians. <br /><br />
          DMT has appeared at crucial junctures in countercultural history.
          William Burroughs was jacking the spice in Tangier at the turn of the
          1960s.<b></b>It was present at the meeting between Ken Kesey's Merry
          Pranksters and Tim Leary's associates. It guided the inception of the
          Grateful Dead in 1965. It showed up in Berkeley in the same year,
          falling into the hands of Terence McKenna, who would eventually become
          its champion in the post-rave neo-psychedelic movement of the 1990s.
          Its indole vapor drifted through Portugal's Boom Festival and has been
          evident at Nevada's Burning Man, where DMT has been adopted as
          spiritual technology supplying shape, color, and depth to a visionary
          art movement. The growing prevalence of use is evident in a vast
          networked independent research culture, and in its impact on fiction,
          film, music and metaphysics. As this book traces the effect of DMT's
          release into the cultural bloodstream, the results should be of great
          interest to contemporary readers. <br /><br />
          The book permits a broad reading audience to join ongoing debates in
          studies in consciousness and theology where the brain is held to be
          either a generator or a receiver of consciousness. The implications of
          the "spirit molecule" or "the brain's own psychedelic" among other
          theories illustrate that DMT may lift the lid on the Pandora's Box of
          consciousness. <br /><br />
          Features a foreword by Dennis McKenna, cover art by Beau Deeley, and
          thirty color illustrations by various artists, including Alex Grey,
          Android Jones, Martina Hoffmann, Luke Brown, Carey Thompson, Adam
          Scott Miller, Randal Roberts, along with Jay Bryan, Cyb, Orryelle
          Defenestrate-Bascule, Art Van D'lay, Stuart Griggs, Jay Lincoln,
          Gwyllm Llwydd, Shiptu Shaboo, Marianna Stelmach, and Mister
          Strange.<br /><br />
          Regarded as the “nightmare hallucinogen” or celebrated as the “spirit
          molecule,” labelled “psychotogenic” or “entheogenic,” considered a
          dangerous drug or the suspected X-factor in the evolution of
          consciousness, DMT is a powerful enigma. Documenting the scientists
          and artists drawn into its sphere of influence, navigating the liminal
          aesthetics of the “breakthrough” experience, tracing the novum of
          “hyperspace” in esoteric and science fiction currents,
          <i>Mystery School in Hyperspace </i>excavates the significance of this
          enigmatic phenomenon in the modern world.<br /><br />
          Exposing a great many myths, this cultural history reveals how DMT has
          had a beneficial influence on the lives of those belonging to a vast
          underground network whose reports and initiatives expose drug war
          propaganda and shine a light in the shadows. This conversation is
          highly relevant at a time when significant advances are being made to
          lift the moratorium on human research with psychedelics.

          “Meticulously researched and highly readable. St John covers every
          imaginable aspect of DMT’s place in the Western aesthetic and
          intellectual landscapes. Setting down his book, I came away with a new
          appreciation of just how embedded the DMT meme has become.”
