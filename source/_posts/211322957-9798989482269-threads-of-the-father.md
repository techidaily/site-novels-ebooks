            Connection to God in a busy and distracting world can seem so
            elusive. Can you imagine that the God of the universe would stoop
            down to share His words, His thoughts, and His love with you?

            Like an industrious weaver, Penny Renfroe has pieced together
            thoughts, words, and poetry to help us dream with God again as He
            answers our questions and heals our deepest longings.

            This book is packed with threads of His presence, wisdom,
            inspiration, guidance, and revelations for the one bold enough to
            pick it up and read! The common thread through each writing is the
            faithfulness of God in encouraging His children to come closer.

            others reveal His heart. They reveal a sabbath rest in Him. It's a
            solitude we find in the midst of the busy world we live in. It's
            true Selah Time. Her book is well worth the read.

            gives the reader a firsthand look into her heart and her
            conversations with God. She is open to share her desires while also
            sharing how God answers her with peace, comfort, and provision. This
            reminds us that we are never alone, and that we, too, can have the
            same kind of relationship with our Father. This is a must-read for
            anyone seeking to grow closer in this relationship. </span
