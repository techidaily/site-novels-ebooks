          This title was first published in 2002. This book builds on
          contemporary discussion of 'mysticism' and religious experience by
          examining the process and content of 'religious knowing' in classical
          and modern Advaita. Drawing from the work of William Alston and Alvin
          Plantinga, Thomas Forsthoefel examines key streams of Advaita with
          special reference to the conditions, contexts, and scope of epistemic
          merit in religious experience. Forsthoefel uniquely employs specific
          analytical categories of contemporary Western epistemologies as
          heuristics to examine the cognitive dimension of religious experience
          in Indian Vedanta. Showing the developing nuances in the analysis of
          religious experience in the thought of Shankara and his immediate
          disciples (Suresvara and Padmapada) as well as in the teaching of
          Ramana Maharshi, an understudied but important South Indian saint of
          the 20th century, this book offers a substantial contribution to
          studies of Indian philosophy as well as to contemporary philosophy of
          religion. Using the tools of exegesis and comparative philosophy,
          Forsthoefel argues for a careful justification of claims following
          religious experience, even if such claims involve, as they do in the
          Advaita, a paradoxical 'knowing beyond knowledge'.

          Thomas A. Forsthoefel earned his PhD from the University of Chicago,
          specializing in Indian philosophy and religion. His publications have
          appeared in numerous journals, including Philosophy East and West,
          Journal of Vaisnava Studies, Journal of Dharma, and the International
          Journal of Hindu Studies. His areas of interest include comparative
          philosophy and theology, the study of mysticism and religious
          experience, and the phenomenon of the guru in India. He is currently
          co-editing a book on mahagurus and, in addition, working on a book
          that examines the epistemology of holiness, The Communion of Saints:
          Models of Holiness in a World of Conflict (Orbis).
