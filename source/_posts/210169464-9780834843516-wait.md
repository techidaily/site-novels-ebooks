              >Pause, find connection, and choose peace rather than harm when

            ></b
          ><br /><br />You are the calm of the ocean, not the pounding wave. The
          tumultuous, confusing, and unbearable feelings that arise in life will
          never overtake your true essence and the peace you can find below the
          surface.<br /><br />Written as a love letter to those in pain,
          <i>Wait</i> encourages us to seek out a path to peace and freedom from
          suffering. Cuong Lu, a long-time disciple of Thich Nhat Hanh,
          personally witnessed a shooting while fleeing Vietnam in 1975. The
          memory of this trauma prompted him to dedicate his life to sharing the
          wisdom of deep listening, finding understanding, and in his words,
          "defusing the bombs in our hearts." We have waited long enough for the
          violence to stop. Now is the time to help turn the tide, interrupt the
          cycle of violence, and create a world where love and understanding
          thrive.

          “Wise words to touch your heart, change your mind, and affect your
          actions—a path to view and experience life differently.”—Mo Gawdat,
          former chief business officer of Google [X],&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<i
            >Solve for Happy</i
          ><br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          <b>“</b>Truly a book for our times. A poetic invitation to clarity and
          heartful living. Cuong Lu issues this call as someone who’s known the
          depths of trouble and pain and discovered relief and richness on the
          path. This voice is a much-needed balm in the heat of a divisive
          world.”—Ralph De La Rosa, LCSW, author of
          <i>Don’t Tell Me to Relax </i>and <i>The Monkey Is the Messenger</i
          ><br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          “With simple, poetic, and honest prose, Cuong Lu offers indelible
          wisdom for a life well-lived. We learn about the power of the human
          experience, in all its sorrows and all its joys, through heartfelt
          stories and beautifully crafted language. A must-read for anyone
          wanting to cultivate genuine peace in the heart.”—Devon Hase, author
          of <i>How Not to Be a Hot Mess</i><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “Cuong Lu has written a down-to-earth book that will soothe and
          inspire. He speaks as a dear friend, someone who has experienced his
          share of suffering and has come to see the wisdom of hardships as
          jewels to cherish. He gives us the gift of no-fear in his
          encouragement to stop, wait and study the details of our life, for
          this is the way to joy. Thank you, Cuong Lu.”—Sensei June Ryushin
          Tanoue, cofounder of Zen Life and Meditation Center, Chicago<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In a time of worldwide trauma, when it&nbsp;seems raging egos are the
          norm, Cuong Lu steps forward to remind us of eternal truths. He speaks
          of the ocean of wisdom which is part of us all, that strength,
          stability, and inspiration come from within. ‘In every person, we can
          see a Buddha, an awakening being,’ he writes. This book is a gift:
          Cuong Lu’s generosity and enthusiasm for life is wonderfully
          infectious, and never has it been better expressed than
          in&nbsp;<i>Wait</i>.”—John Oakes, publisher,
          <i>The Evergreen Review</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “An impassioned plea for an end to violence and hatred, this book is
          full of wise suggestions for how to manage our most difficult
          emotions. Cuong Lu grew up in Vietnam during the war and his message
          to those in despair was hard won and is deeply personal. His ‘love
          letter’ speaks to us all.&nbsp;Lu writes, ‘Suffering is not the
          problem. The way to free yourself from pain is to feel it.’”—Wes
          Nisker, author of <i>Essential Crazy Wisdom </i>and
          <i>Buddha’s Nature</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In <i>Wait</i>, Cuong Lu delicately weaves between our external
          reality and our inner realm, helping us understand how they are
          interchangeably interwoven—that there is just one universe. He shows
          that our only mission is to love and that in every moment we have
          there is an opportunity to exist peacefully. This beautiful book is a
          keyhole into the important work of understanding the connection
          between the inner and the outer world.”—Shelly Tygielski, community
          organizer, self-care activist, trauma-informed mindfulness teacher,
          founder of Pandemic of Love<br /><br />“Cuong’s clear explanations
          offer hard-won hope for anyone struggling to see the bright side.”—<i
            >Publishers Weekly</i
          ><br /><br />“Despite the bleakness one may feel today, it's
          impossible not to feel some optimism after reading this book.”—<i
            >Booklist<br /></i
          ><br />“This book is a gift for a new year, an inspiration to take the
          hardships of 2020 and not recast them, but use those moments of pain,
          and others, to find renewal through individual experiences of despair.
          Most importantly, Lu offers, to those who need it, the knowledge that
          pain and despair are not the end, but there can be something waiting
          on the other side.”—Shelf Awareness
