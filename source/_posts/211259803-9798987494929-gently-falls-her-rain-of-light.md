            In <strong>Gently Falls Her Rain Of Light</strong> a new collection
            of inspired poetry and prose, Lawrence Edwards, PhD continues to
            share the gifts from the Great Goddess that he receives in
            meditative states.&nbsp;Dr. Edwards is a highly regarded scholar,
            mystic, and meditation teacher. His critically acclaimed poetry is
            in the tradition of Kabir, Hafiz and Rumi - pointing to the living
            presence of the One, the Divine, pervading all times and all
            places.&nbsp;The poems inspire, instruct, and urge one to discover
            what mystics of every tradition have found within their hearts - the
            Infinite One of many faces - by whose grace all of life can
            experienced as the unfolding of the Divine.&nbsp;Lawrence writes,
            "there's never a time, never a place, that you're not in the Divine
            embrace."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Lawrence Edwards has a unique and love drenched connection to the
            divine Mother as Kali. From this connection has flowed a stream of
            living holy water. A long unfurling tender revelation in poems of
            profound devotion and awe. His new book, while absolutely aware of
            Kali's savagery, celebrates the mystery behind that savagery. A
            mystery of burning tender transfiguring love. What deeper
            inspiration could we ask for in a time so threatened by nihilism and
            despair. -<strong>Andrew Harvey</strong>, author of The Return of
            the Mother; The Hope; and Radical Regeneration with Carolyn Baker.

            This powerful collection of poems invites us to risk leaping off the
            edge of rational, binary knowing into the sacred Unknowing that lies
            around and within us. Turning from poem to poem becomes a dance
            conducted by the Lord and Mistress of eternal Love.&nbsp;Gently
            Falls Her Rain of Light resonates with the wisdom found in such
            mystics of East and West as Jesus, Buddha, Marguerite Porete, Julian
            of Norwich, Meister Eckhart, Thomas Merton, Ibn 平Arab朝, Paramahansa
            Yogananda, and Ramakrishna. -<strong>Dr. Robert A. Jonas</strong>,

            Back in the 1970s Ram Das summed up the teachings on how to achieve
            enlightenment with the words "Be here now." The idea being that if
            you could, even for one instant, be absolutely, unconditionally in
            the present moment - in the NOW - you would dissolve into the
            luminescent light of pure consciousness.&nbsp;Lawrence Edwards'
            beautiful and moving poetry in Gently Falls Her Rain of Light takes
            you into that moment and guides you on the journey to finding
            yourself - finding your true Self - in the radiant light and Oneness
            of All. -<strong>Teri Degler</strong>, author of The Divine Feminine

            Poetry often conveys truth better than any other form. In this book
            you will encounter beautiful words that shine with truth. The truth
            of love, the truth of surrender, and the truth of unity. Reading
            these poems with an open heart and mind you find yourself invited
            into an inner revolution that leads back to your original
            home.&nbsp;I would encourage&nbsp;anyone to savor these profound
            expressions of truth.&nbsp;-<strong>Jeff Carreira</strong>,

            Kalidas (Lawrence Edwards) guides the reader beyond tendencies to
            dwell in memory, confusion, and reactivity into the light of Divine
            Presence. This collection of treasures is filled with gems of
            insight, gold of wisdom, and beauty that reflects the faces of the
            Divine. Each poem is an invitation to embrace and dance with the
            Sacred. -<strong>Martin Lowenthal, PhD</strong>, author of Avatars

        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each and every poem is an invitation from the
          Divine Feminine - pouring into and out of Lawrence - to enter into
          Union, into Wholeness, into the Oneness and radiance of the All. These
          poems contain so many moving images, so many deeply relevant insights,
          so many Truths, that it is almost impossible to pick out the most
          meaningful among them.&nbsp;And yet here are a few lines that, in
          their exquisite and utter simplicity, summed up for me the ineffable
          peace that can be found when one loses oneself in the lustrous light
          of the Beloved:
        </p>
        <p class="ql-align-center">Take refuge in</p>
        <p class="ql-align-center">My loving embrace</p>
        <p class="ql-align-center">Rest in Beauty</p>
        <p class="ql-align-center">Rest in Grace.</p>
