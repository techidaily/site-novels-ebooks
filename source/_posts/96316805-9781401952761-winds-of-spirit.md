            >A practical guide to connect to powerful wind energies that
            navigate us toward authentic joy, power, and purpose.<br /></b
          ><br />In this book, you’ll explore the rich mythology and cultural
          significance of wind, and discover a powerful system to utilize the
          subtle, healing energies in your life. <i>Winds of Spirit</i> will
          teach you how to connect with your true inner self, use your body as a
          compass, and receive life-changing messages from nature.
          <br /><br />Based on an ancient sacred technique used by farmers,
          shamans and sailors, this system will show you how to navigate your
          personal path, providing insight into how to manage the wind patterns
          and shifting conditions affecting you. You will also learn how to
          invoke wind deities—gods and goddesses from around the world—and the
          cardinal winds from the four quadrants of the sky, each of which
          relate to the inner landscape of your life: mind, emotions, body, and
          spirit. <br /><br />By working with the omnipresent winds in your
          life, you can restore harmony and balance, heal the body, and inspire
          creativity.<br /><br /><i
            >Experiential practices include wind breath, wind bath, wind knots,
            and more!</i

          into a lover of the wind. Renee Baribeau is an exquisite wordsmith.
          Her writing emerges from the depth of her heart and soul as she writes

            >Winds of Spirit</i
          >
          is a beautiful and thought-provoking book that presents the winds as
          transpersonal forces of nature that live around and within us
          throughout our lives. This absorbing book held my interest to the last
          page, and reveals Renee Baribeau as a modern, western medicine woman.”
          <br />
          — <b>Hank Wesselman, Ph.D.</b>, anthropologist, shamanist teacher, and
          author of The Re-Enchantment, the award-winning

          <i>Spiritwalker</i> trilogy <br /><br />
          “Praises to Renee Baribeau for blowing a gust of fresh wind into the
          rich shamanic body of wisdom. This book masterfully reconnects us to
          the wind gods and goddesses, and steers us to think and develop an
          intimate relationship with that life-giving and destructive force, one
          we may take for granted. Read this remarkable book.” <br />
          — <b>Itzhak Beery</b>, author of <i>The Gift of Shamanism</i>,
          <i>Shamanic Transformations</i>, and <i>Shamanic Healing</i>

          “Renee has masterfully enlaced cultural knowledge and practices,
          bringing us a new global vision of the wind spirits to help us
          navigate our tumultuous times toward a more beautiful tomorrow.”<br />
          — <b>Elizabeth B. Jenkins</b>, best-selling author of
          <i>The Return of the Inka</i> <br /><br />
          “Renee Baribeau has written a must-read primer for anyone considering
          their own spiritual evolution. I was riveted by the depth of her
          myths, legends, and sacred stories. Her work is not only a scholarly
          treatise on the resilience of the human spirit, but a deeply evocative
          narrative that bore her vulnerability with a sense of power and
          dignity. Her use of ancient storytelling had me sitting on the edge of
          my seat. The reader is served by her eloquence, imagination, and
          authentic truth telling. For some readers, the entire book will lead
          to an inner awakening and a revelation of all that is holy.”<br />
