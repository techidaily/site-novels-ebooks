            <br />Mark Santfield was out camping in the High Sierra Mountains of
            Northern California and he did not see it coming. He had not
            suspected a thing, until the disc-shaped spaceship was hovering
            sixty-feet above him and that uplifting male human sounding voice
            telepathically introduced himself right inside his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recently, he had became successful from the publication of his first
            conspiracy theory book&nbsp;about a shadowy government operating
            behind the scenes with suspected totalitarian extraterrestrial
            oversight, and he just finished doing research for his second book.
            He had interviewed dozens of men, women and children that claimed
            aliens abducted them, abused them in some manner, and then returned
            them with no memory of the experience. That is, until deep hypnosis
            regression therapy sessions awakened them to what actually happened.
            Even after he had finished interviewing the sincere claims of these
            people, Mark was still very skeptical about the truth of their
            stories, until the spaceship from another world and its seemingly
            benevolent pilot appeared overhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, the only thing he could think of was he was about to
            become like one of those questionable abducted people
            himself,&nbsp;except he was being asked. He mused about how ironic
            it was that he was about to gain first-hand experience aboard an
            alien space ship to actually discover the truth he sensed was
            mysteriously parallel to what was already in the sequel book he had
            just finished and titled,

          This is one the best books I have read in a long time. We have over
          3,000 books, and I found this book to be one of the more fascinating
          books in our collection. I would highly recommend this book to anyone
          that is open minded and willing to learn more about our ET friends.
          They are benevolent and there to help. It is presented as a science
          fiction book; however, it was based on real events. It is not only
          full of surprises but brings hope for humanity. It keeps your
          attention at a steady to fast pace from start to finish. Judi,
          Calgary, Canada.

          I thoroughly enjoyed reading the "The Seres Agenda." Lemriel discloses
          the vast potential within humanity that has been suppressed by dark
          technology and the rescue efforts underway that require our conscious
          participation. The plot constantly advances in an exciting way and
          Lemriel’s writing style is very visual; offering detailed descriptions
          of the advanced craft and technology used by off-world groups both
          good and evil. Having watched a couple video presentations of the
          author, the book reads credible and the information syncs up with my
          intuition with respect to the wondrous events that are now taking
          place to elevate the consciousness of the planet and embark on a new
          chapter in our journey, taking us to the stars.<br /><br />In
          addition, working with the exercises at the end of the book has helped
          me to remember my dreams and has lightened my mood and my heart.<br /><br />This
          is a unique book in my experience. Michael Kelly

          I read it through in a couple days.... I absolutely love and will be
          purchasing the other books in his series. I wish<br />I had been able
          to purchase the 2015 edition that has the special techniques chapter,
          but I may just ask for that one for Christmas. I love his work and his
          website and his radio and YT channel. YOU WILL BELIEVE... Lisa Colbert

          The reason I give this a five star rating is because of the message it
          conveys of forgiveness and freedom. It is written like a screenplay
          more than a novel. Maybe someday it can be turned into a movie! Since
          the story is based from a truth in our reality, it fascinates me. All
          the stories we have heard growing up are now being shared as true and
          this book helps with processing that truth through meditative
          exercises at the end. It is full of adventure, space travel and
          kindness. Knowing there is truth hidden within this book, I had to put
          it down a few times after a few chapters to absorb the knowledge. Then
          I would continue through the book, soaking in the possibilities.<br />This
          is a good book to read and experience! "Hue" !!!&nbsp; &nbsp; S. Kaye

          Written as fiction but reality is author's own journey mixed with the
          hidden history and truth of our planet and exposing the agenda of the
          hidden rulers. However, a highly advanced race SERES (pronounced
          say-rays) have given us a mighty tool to end the control by a
          diabolical ET race that's kept humanity in ignorance for 500.000
          years: This tool is the primordial sound HU which is the first two
          letters of our HUman-ity. An exciting read with a lovely bit of
          romance mixed in! Margaret Newson
