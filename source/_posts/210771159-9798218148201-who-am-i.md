              date rape incident. His lineage, which he had once believed to be
              an essential element of his being, was lost forever. The pain and
              internal struggle caused by this revelation consumed his thoughts
              daily. Anvil found writing helped soothe his suffering. </span

            >A dark secret, a devastating truth, an identity crisis, choices,
            fighting depression, and acceptance, Who Am I is a collection of
            poems and prose by Anvil Long. Anvil, a child of rape, is shocked
            when he learns the truth about his biological father. This discovery
            initiates a change in his perception of his identity, and he starts
            questioning the foundation of his existence as if it were a lie. But
            when his friend mentions Ben Lerner, Anvil draws inspiration from
            his poems and starts penning his innermost feelings and confessions.
            Divided into three parts titled Impetus, Discovery, and Healing,
            each part is a revelation of his struggles in each phase of denial
            and acceptance. He shares his experiences of the journey he takes,
            from being depressed after discovering the truth to healing from
            trauma and accepting himself as an individual despite bloodlines and
            lineage. He later realizes that family is not defined by blood, but
            by choice, love, acceptance, and trust. It is a memoir that is
            inspiring, motivating, and emotional.</strong

            >Who Am I is one of the most interesting and sensitive memoirs I
            have come across in a while. Anvil Long shares his experiences of
            beating depression by starting to write. His written accounts reveal
            his deepest feelings, which is proof of the pain he went through.
            The poems remind me of Wordsworth: "Poetry is the continuous
            overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotions
            recollected in tranquility." As I kept reading, a few lines from
            Anvil's poem Finding Myself in Part 3 reminded me of The Road Not
            Taken by Robert Frost. Anvil finds his love for solo riding on open
            roads, which finally gives him clarity and the making of his
            destiny.</strong

            >Anvil Long sets the perfect example of how we can learn to channel
            our pain to achieve a greater sense of purpose, achieve freedom,
            forgive and accept the harshest of truths, and move forward without
            waiting for society's approval. The flow of his thoughts reflects in
            his figurative language, and poetic liberty gives him the upper hand
            to explore various writing styles, doing justice to literature. One
            should have a copy of this at home as it inspires and gives hope to
            those that are lost and struggling to connect to their loved ones.
            It is also proof that writing is another way of coping, which
            provides one with a sense of ownership of the story.</strong
