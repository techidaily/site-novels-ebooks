          <b
            >Provides a clear and accessible guide to the many different North
            Asian shamanic traditions, past and present.<br /><br />
            What is shamanism? Where is it from? How does one become a shaman? </b
          >What are the requirements to become one? Anthropologists tell us that
          the word shaman derives from the Tungus language and traditions, but
          few people understand the full scope of what that means. In his
          groundbreaking book, Spirit Voices,
          <b>David Shi answers all these questions and more.</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Drawing upon his own ancestral traditions, Shi explores the history
          and practice of shamanism. He
          <b
            >guides readers through what may be the unfamiliar landscapes of
            North Asia</b
          >—the place where shamanism was born—as well as the largely hidden and
          unfamiliar traditions of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungus shamanism,
          exploring the subtle and unique aspects of each tradition. Shi
          provides a clear and accessible guide that explores the many different
          North Asian shamanic traditions.&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          So, what exactly is shamanism? David Shi suggests that the most
          accurate definition derives from shamanologist Nicholas Breeze Wood,
          who writes, “A shaman is someone chosen by the spirits [typically at
          or before birth] and who can go into a controlled and repeatable
          deliberate trance state, during which they A) experience ‘spirit
          flight,’ where they go to the spirit worlds and meet spirits, who they
          either fight with, negotiate with, or trick, in order to create change
          in this physical world, or B) are often taken over/possessed by the
          spirits (normally ancestral shaman spirits, or local land spirits)
          while in this physical world—the spirits using the shaman’s voice and
          body to heal, or give advice to members of the shaman’s community.
          Without the spirits and their blessing, a shaman cannot exist or
          function. Without the trance state, it is not shamanism.”<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Featuring history,
          <b>firsthand experiential reports, mythology, and folklore</b>,
          <i>Spirit Voices</i> explores the spirits, spirituality, tools, and
          practices of true shamanism, past and present. Shi
          <b
            >also provides practical information for those readers seeking to
            implement shamanic practices</b
          >, including those that are appropriate to noninitiates and outsiders
          to the culture. As the author points out, “<b
            >the purpose of shamanism can be summed up in two words: coexistence
            and balance—coexistence with our spirits and our communities, and
            the balance that must be preserved between all of us and within
            ourselves</b
          >.”
