            >This fascinating book holds an important key. Whether you’re
            interested in the science of thinking and beliefs, how your own mind
            operates, how others control your thoughts, why things just don’t
            work out for you, how you can create the life you’ve always wanted,
            how you can realize your true potential, how you can find peace, or,
            on a grander scale, how you can help make the world a better place,
            this book provides insights for all. <br /></b
          ><br />Simply reading it will open your eyes to new worlds of
          possibilities. You’ll change once you’re exposed to the illusions most
          live under and by, and putting into practice any of these very simple
          teachings will open the door for you to achieve your highest
          potential.<br /><br /><i>Choices and Illusions</i> tells the story of
          one man’s journey into the workings of the human mind and our reason
          for being. The adventure is every bit as exciting as the best
          scientific discoveries. <b>Eldon Taylor</b>’s approach is pragmatic,
          and his conclusions are inspirational and soul enhancing. Along the
          journey, you’ll hear fantastic stories of divine intervention, see why
          you think and do what you don’t wish to do, and understand the very
          clear message that it’s never too late to be happy and succeed,
          regardless of your past actions.<br /><br />Eldon says, "Many believe
          that self-help and self-improvement is about rags to riches, failure
          to success, and so forth, when indeed it’s the beginning of a journey
          into self-discovery. Inside every human being is an eternal truth and
          a life purpose. Using our mind power is simply starting the engine on
          that path toward highest self-actualization."<br /><br /><b

          “Read this book! We are living at a time when people are searching for
          answers to fundamental questions in their lives. This book can be, if
          applied, a road map to personal enlightenment and empowerment. I
          believe it can ‘tune in’ the frequency you are currently operating on.
          More important, it helps you see that you can manifest change.” —
          <b>John Edward</b>, psychic medium and author of <i>After Life</i> and
          <i>Understanding Your Angels and Meeting Your Guides<br /><br /></i
          >“In <i>Choices and Illusions</i>, Eldon Taylor takes us on a
          delightful and provocative odyssey through the corridors of
          consciousness. Using solid science, practical spirituality, and common
          sense, he shows that our perceptions can be changed—and, once
          different, can catalyze dramatic improvements in our health and
          well-being.” — <b>Dawson Church, Ph.D.</b>, author of
          <i>The Genie in Your Genes</i> and <i>Mind to Matter</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Choices and Illusions</i> is a smart, practical book
          by a grand master of the mind. If you want to get out of the box of
          your own thinking, and touch a greater reality, Eldon Taylor can show
          you how.” — <b>Joan Borysenko, Ph.D.</b>, author of
          <i>Your Soul’s Compass</i> and
          <i>Inner Peace for Busy People<br /><br /></i>“<i
            >Choices and Illusions</i
          >
          opens our minds to explore inwardly—to explore how our minds work and
          how to harness our minds to become clear about our purpose in life and
          the Love that we are.” — <b>Gerald G. Jampolsky, M.D.</b>, author of
          <i>Teach Only Love</i> and <i>Good-bye to Guilt<br /><br /></i>“This
          is an extraordinary and complete overview of mind and consciousness
          from someone who has been demonstrating it in his life for many
          years.” — <b>Lynne McTaggart</b>, author of <i>The Field</i> and
          <i>The Intention Experiment<br /><br /></i>“More and more people are
          reaching out today in search of answers to life. Sometimes the search
          is to understand relationships, improve performance, or become
          successful—unfortunately, most people look outside of themselves for
          both the answers and the best actions. They excuse themselves with
          rationalizations. If only the universe would give me a break. If only
          he or she would change. If only I had been born differently, and so
          on. If you’ve found yourself somewhere in life where you don’t want to
          be, then read <i>Choices and Illusions</i>.” — <b>Marci Shimoff</b>,
          professional speaker and #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author
          of <i>Happy for No Reason</i>, <i>Love for No Reason</i>, and
          <i>Chicken Soup for the Woman’s Soul<br /><br /></i>“When you realize
          just how much of your actions are automatic and how many of your
          choices are actually made by your subconscious, you understand the
          illusion we all have lived most of our lives! Eldon Taylor’s book
          <i>Choices and Illusions</i> delivers both the path in and the way out
          to move from where you are to where you want to be, and it does so in
          straight talk everyone can understand. This book should be required
          reading for young and old alike!” —
          <b>C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, author of
          <i>Energy Medicine<br /><br /></i>“I can see why
          <i>Choices and Illusions</i> became a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
          when it was first released—and this revised edition offers so much
          more. Thisis the best guidebook to show you how you got where you are
          and how you can get to where you would rather be. Once again, in his
          enlightening and compelling style, Eldon Taylor reveals inestimably
          valuable information to help you achieve the success you seek in any
          of your goals.” — <b>Sandra Anne Taylor</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>Quantum Success<br /><br /></i>“Your mind is incredibly powerful.
          You have been brought to this exact moment in your life by your
          thoughts. In <i>Choices and Illusions</i>, Eldon Taylor offers clear
          guidelines for changing your life and your choices for the better.” —
