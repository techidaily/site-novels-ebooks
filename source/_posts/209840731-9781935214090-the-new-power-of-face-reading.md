          The NEW Power of Face Reading is a must for anyone who wants to hone
          their intuition and social skills. Highly recommended!--Midwest Book
          Review, March 2013 How do you feel about your face? When you look in
          the mirror, do you see all perfection, all the time? Or you see a nose
          that's too wide, and it's got this weird dent in the middle? Lips too
          thin? Cheeks too chubby? Your chin, oh God, it's sticks out and it's
          all anyone can see?Even if you don't experience mirror anxiety, are
          you and your face really friends? Or are you more like old roommates,
          just getting along because you have to? Rose Rosetree and her system
          of Face Reading Secrets® can change that.-- Pathways MagazineIn
          fascinating detail and with humor, Rosetree teaches readers how to
          decode faces for insights into people's personality, character,
          interpersonal behavior and work style. From the curviness of your
          eyebrows to your nostril size, your face's topography may offer a
          window into the inner you. --Brandeis Magazine, Spring 2013
