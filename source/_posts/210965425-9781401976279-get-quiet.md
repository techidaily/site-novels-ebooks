          "This book has the power to connect you with your soul and transform
          your life."<br />— <b>Kristen Butler</b>, founder of Power of
          Positivity<br /><br />We're living in frenetic times. Amid the
          busyness and complexity, you may also feel directionless and
          overwhelmed. Maybe you know there’s more to life, but you have no idea
          what that "more" is. Maybe you sense there's a message you need to
          hear, but the noise of everyday life is drowning it out.<br /><br /><i
            >Get Quiet</i
          >
          is your guide to turn down the volume and tune in to the voice of your
          soul.<br /><br />In these pages, coach and healer Elaine Glass invites
          you to walk with her on the Get Quiet Way—a practice of healing and
          transformation inspired by the classical form of the labyrinth. You’ll
          follow seven circuits of reflection and discovery, each engaging an
          energy point on the body to awaken its particular power, until you
          reach a still point at the center—a sacred space where you can connect
          deeply with the truth of who you are. Finally, you'll step back into
          the world feeling stronger and clearer, more at peace, and open to new
          possibilities for a life of purpose and joy.<br /><br />"A timely
          antidote to the overwhelm that so many of us are feeling. Just as
          healthy foods are the right medicine for your body,
          <i>Get Quiet</i> is the right medicine for your soul."<br />—
