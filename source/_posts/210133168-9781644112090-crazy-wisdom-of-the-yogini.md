          in an isolated Himalayan forest, Daniel Odier met Lalita Devi, a
          tantric yogini who took him on a mystical journey beyond the limits of
          sexual experience to transcend the ego, recognize the true self, and
          rediscover the Divine nature of absolute love. Now, Odier shares the
          secret teachings and self-realization practices of the Kashmiri
          Mahamudra (meditation on the mind itself) and the Pratyabhijna (the
          School of Sudden Recognition).<br /><br />The author offers vivid
          descriptions of his sessions with Lalita Devi wherein she imparted the
          essential principles of the Mahamudra and the yoga of emotions to him
          physically, verbally, and energetically. Lalita Devi knew the
          principal texts of Kashmiri Shaivism by heart. New translations of the
          most significant sacred books, including the Shiva Sutras, the
          Pratyabhijnahrdayam, and the Spandakarika, are provided by Odier along
          with chants and poems from the yogini tradition. Presented in language
          that preserves their spontaneous mystic flow and restores their
          original ancient female origins,
          <i>Crazy Wisdom of the Yogini</i> offers a profound inside look at
          authentic tantric teachings.

          “Now, more than forty-five years after the teachings of the Kashmiri
          Mahamudra tradition were first transmitted to him in the Himalayas by
          his master, the yogini Lalita Devi, Daniel Odier himself has become a
          master of these teachings. Through a dazzling mix of his vivid
          recollections of his encounters with Lalita, his erudite exploration
          of the key ancient Kashmiri Mahamudra texts, and his presentation of
          the 14th-century devotional poetry of Lalla, Odier eloquently imparts
          to us in <i>Crazy Wisdom of the Yogini</i> daily practices that create
          a life of tranquility and insight.”
