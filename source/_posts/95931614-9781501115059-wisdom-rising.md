            >Through her own story of loss and spiritual seeking, paired with
            mandala meditations and rituals, bestselling author of
            <i>Feeding Your Demons</i> Lama Tsultrium Allione teaches you how to
            embody the enlightened, fierce power of the sacred feminine—the
            tantric dakinis.</b
          ><br /><br />Ordained as one of the first Western Buddhist nuns and
          recognized as a reincarnation of a renowned eleventh century Tibetan
          yogini, Lama Tsultrim nonetheless yearned to become a mother,
          ultimately renouncing her vows so she could marry and have children.
          When she subsequently lost a child to SIDS, she found courage again in
          female Buddhist role models, and discovered a way to transform her
          pain into a path forward. Through Lama Tsultrim’s story of loss and
          spiritual seeking, paired with her many years of expertise in mandala
          meditation, you will learn how to strengthen yourself by following
          this experiential journey to Tantric Buddhist practice.<br />
          <br />The mandala was developed as a tool for spiritual
          transformation, and as you harness its power, it can serve as a guide
          to wholeness. With knowledge of the mandala of the five dakinis
          (female Buddhist deities who embody wisdom), you’ll understand how to
          embrace the distinct energies of your own nature.<br />
          <br />In <i>Wisdom Rising</i>, Lama Tsultrim shares from a deep trove
          of personal experiences as well as decades of sacred knowledge to
          invite you to explore an ancient yet accessible path to the ability to
          shift your emotional challenges into empowerment. Her unique
          perspective on female strength and enlightenment will guide you as you
          restore your inner spirit, leading you toward the change you aspire to
          create in the world.
