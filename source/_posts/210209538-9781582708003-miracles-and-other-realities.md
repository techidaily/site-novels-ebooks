            >Once in a generation, a person of extraordinary psychic powers
            comes along. <i>Miracles and Other Realities</i> tells the true
            story of Thomaz Green Morton, a gifted psychic from the Minas Gerais
            region of Brazil.</b
          ><br /><br />Originally published in 1990 and now rereleased for a
          modern audience,<i> Miracles and Other Realities</i> recounts the
          fascinating story of Thomaz Green Morton and his powerful psychic
          abilities. This book will turn the heads of scientists, whose
          traditional acceptance of reality has been limited to that which can
          be measured objectively, and will introduce to a wider audience the
          power of mind over matter.<br />
          <br />Thomaz’s story begins when he is struck by lightning on his
          twelfth birthday. This electrical insult to his body detonated a
          dazzling range of paranormal abilities. (Severe electric shock is,
          incidentally, common to the childhood experience of every major
          psychic.) Thomaz has since been called the most powerful psychic in
          the world. Driven by his mind to the farther reaches of reality to
          produce psychic phenomena such as metal-bending, spiritual healing,
          and transmutations of matter, Thomaz’s feats are well-documented by
          the authors. The story is all the more captivating because Thomaz is
          graced with a childlike emotional temperament, making him intent on
          living life to its fullest.<br />
          <br />Coauthors Lee Pulos and Gary Richman explore through Thomaz the
          ways in which magic, or <i>miracles</i>, challenges the conventional
          view of reality, thereby shaking up rational belief systems that
          inhibit the experience of new realms of possibility. Readers will find
          Thomaz’s story compelling, not only as a real-life example of human
          potential but as a metaphor for unleashing other realities and levels
          of consciousness to tap into the potential within themselves.
