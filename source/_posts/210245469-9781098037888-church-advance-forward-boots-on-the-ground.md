          <p>
            Whenever God wants to do something, a child is born. From Adam,
            Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Esther, Nehemiah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel,
            Hosea, Debra, Joel, Obadiah, Zephaniah, Malachi, John the Baptist,
            Jesus, the disciples, Paul, to you and me. God has raised you up to
            be his hands extended in the marketplaceâ€”your homes, workplace,
            government, the arts, religion, media, education, and calling you to
            advance forward with him to introduce all to the kingdom of light
            and overthrow the kingdom of darkness. We are to go to the high
            places (strongholds in our lives, our generation and the world) and
            tear the devil's kingdom down. He has shown us the way to him and
            have given us the charge to show others the way to him through the
            Word, his love, and our lives (2 Cor 3:2). We have been instructed
            to go in to all the world baptizing and teaching those under our
            sphere of influence what God has taught us. You do not have to wait
            for a position in the church or become a minister or pastor to do
            the work of God. If you are a born again, blood-brought child of
            God, you have the authority, through the Holy Spirit that lives in
            you, to proclaim the goodness of God (1 Pet. 2:9). The Bible said
            that "they overcame -Triumph over him by the blood; cleaning,
            forgiving, redeeming, blood of lamp and the word of their testimony.
            They did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death" (Rev.
            12:11). Tell them what you have seen, what you have heard, and what
            you have experienced, so that they also may have fellowship with us,
            with the Father, and with his son, Jesus Christ (1 John 1:3).I will
            venture to say that we all have been placed in one of these cultural
            mountains of influence (arts, religion, media, education, family,
            government, and economy). This is a Clarion Call to the church, or
            should I say the Body of Christ. It is a call to advance forward, to
            go forth, a call to action. You are the boots on the ground. Go! Go!
            Go!
