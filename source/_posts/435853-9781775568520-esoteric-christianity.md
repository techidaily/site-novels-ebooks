          <p>
            The object of this book is to suggest certain lines of thought as to
            the deep truths underlying Christianity, truths generally
            overlooked, and only too often denied. The generous wish to share
            with all what is precious, to spread broadcast priceless truths, to
            shut out none from the illumination of true knowledge, has resulted
            in a zeal without discretion that has vulgarised Christianity, and
            has presented its teachings in a form that often repels the heart
            and alienates the intellect. The command to "preach the Gospel to
            every creature" - though admittedly of doubtful authenticity - has
            been interpreted as forbidding the teaching of the Gnosis to a few,
            and has apparently erased the less popular saying of the same Great
            Teacher: "Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
            your pearls before swine."
          </p>
          <p>
            If true knowledge, the Gnosis, is again to form a part of Christian
            teachings, it can only be under the old restrictions, and the idea
            of levelling down to the capacities of the least developed must be
            definitely surrendered. Only by teaching above the grasp of the
            little evolved can the way be opened up for a restoration of arcane
            knowledge, and the study of the Lesser Mysteries must precede that
            of the Greater. The Greater will never be published through the
            printing-press; they can only be given by Teacher to pupil, "from
            mouth to ear." But the Lesser Mysteries, the partial unveiling of
            deep truths, can even now be restored, and such a volume as the
            present is intended to outline these, and to show the nature of the
            teachings which have to be mastered. Where only hints are given,
            quiet meditation on the truths hinted at will cause their outlines
            to become visible, and the clearer light obtained by continued
            meditation will gradually show them more fully. For meditation
            quiets the lower mind, ever engaged in thinking about external
            objects, and when the lower mind is tranquil then only can it be
            illuminated by the Spirit. Knowledge of spiritual truths must be
            thus obtained, from within and not from without, from the divine
            Spirit whose temple we are and not from an external Teacher. These
            things are "spiritually discerned" by that divine indwelling Spirit,
            that "mind of Christ," whereof speaks the Great Apostle, and that
            inner light is shed upon the lower mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the way of the Divine Wisdom, the true THEOSOPHY. It is not,
            as some think, a diluted version of Hinduism, or Buddhism, or
            Taoism, or of any special religion. It is Esoteric Christianity as
            truly as it is Esoteric Buddhism, and belongs equally to all
            religions, exclusively to none. This is the source of the
            suggestions made in this little volume, for the helping of those who
            seek the Light - that "true Light which lighteth every man that
            cometh into the world," though most have not yet opened their eyes
            to it. It does not bring the Light. It only says: "Behold the
            Light!" For thus have we heard. It appeals only to the few who
            hunger for more than the exoteric teachings give them. For those who
            are fully satisfied with the exoteric teachings, it is not intended;
            for why should bread be forced on those who are not hungry? For
            those who hunger, may it prove bread, and not a stone.
