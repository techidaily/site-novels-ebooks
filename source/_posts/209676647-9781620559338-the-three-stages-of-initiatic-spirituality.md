          A detailed guide to the three successive initiatic archetypes:
          Craftsman, Warrior, and Magician <br /><br />• Investigates the
          symbolism, rituals, and metaphysical aspects of each initiatic
          archetype, from the alchemy and shamanism of the craftsman, to the
          subtle energy work of the warrior, to the sex magic practices and
          Higher Self work of the magician <br /><br />• Shares meditations,
          practices, and transformational techniques for each archetype
          <br /><br />• Investigates the similarities between contemporary
          Western occultism, from Crowley to Chaos Magic, and the “positive
          thinking” mind metaphysics movement <br /><br />Exploring the
          craftsman, warrior, and magician archetypes--three vocations that echo
          the traditional tripartite division of society--Angel Millar reveals
          how these archetypes represent the three successive stages of
          spiritual growth in an individual’s life. He shows how they provide
          structure for the initiatory process to develop one’s mental,
          physical, and spiritual potential. As craftsman, the individual
          experiences “mnemonic” initiation: the cultivation of memory as well
          as language. As warrior, “somatic” initiation: development of the
          physical body and cultivation of the spirit body. And as magician,
          “gnostic” initiation: cultivation of the self and manifestation of the
          Higher Self. <br /><br />Investigating the metaphysical aspects of
          each archetype, the author explores their symbolism, spiritual
          practices, and rituals. Examining the craftsman archetype, he looks at
          metallurgy, alchemy, and the “Craft” of Freemasonry, as well as the
          ancient role of blacksmith as shaman. He explores the idea of God as a
          “Creator” or “Craftsman,” especially in relation to ancient Greek
          philosophy, Islamic neoplatonism, and the Kabbalah. Examining the
          warrior archetype, he reveals how the way of the warrior was affected
          by religion and mysticism, such as how the Persian martial art of
          Zoorkhaneh was profoundly shaped by Sufism and why the Buddhist
          Shaolin temple became synonymous with Kung Fu. The author places
          special emphasis on the cultivation of subtle energy as practiced in
          martial arts, especially in relation to Taoist inner alchemy.
          Examining the magician archetype, he reveals how each individual has
          two “selves”--a lower self and a Higher Self--and explores the union
          of opposites studied by the magician, such as in the tantric arts and
          sacred sex magic. Sharing meditations, practices, and processes
          associated with each archetype, as well as techniques for transforming
          one’s consciousness, he also investigates similarities between
          contemporary Western occultism, from Crowley to Chaos Magic, and the
          “positive thinking” mind metaphysics movement. <br /><br />Structured
          to parallel the three archetypal stages of the initiatic process, this
          comprehensive guide offers a literary initiation through three degrees
          of esoteric knowledge.

          "Angel Millar reminds us that initiation is involved with memory–we
          need not so much to learn new things as to remember old ones, buried
          deep within us. We explore with him the adjuncts of Kabbalah and the
          relevance of Neoplatonism, of death and rebirth and of our enlightened
          Self. An absorbing read, well worth it and one of the most important
          works to be published in recent times."
