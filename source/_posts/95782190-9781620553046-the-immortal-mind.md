          Scientific evidence for the continual presence of consciousness with
          or without connection to a living organism <br />
          <br />• Examines findings on the survival of consciousness beyond
          life, including near-death experiences, after-death communication, and
          reincarnation <br />
          <br />• Explains how this correlates precisely with cutting-edge
          physics theories on superstrings, information fields, and energy
          matrices <br />
          <br />• Reveals how consciousness manifests in living beings to
          continue its evolution <br />
          <br />Evidence now points to consciousness existing beyond the brain,
          such as when the brain is temporarily incapacitated, as well as to the
          survival of consciousness after death. Conventional science prefers to
          dismiss these findings because they cannot be accommodated by a
          materialist view of reality. Spirituality and religion embrace the
          continuity of consciousness and ascribe it to a nonmaterial spirit or
          soul that is immortal. As such, spirituality/religion and science
          continually find conflict in their views. But what if there truly is
          no conflict? <br />
          <br />Based on a new scientific paradigm in sync with experience-based
          spirituality, Ervin Laszlo and Anthony Peake explore how consciousness
          is continually present in the cosmos and can exist without connection
          to a living organism. They examine the rapidly growing body of
          scientific evidence supporting the continuity of consciousness,
          including near-death experiences, after-death communication,
          reincarnation, and neurosensory information received in altered
          states. They explain how the persistence of consciousness beyond the
          demise of the body means that, in essence, we are not mortal--we
          continue to exist even when our physical existence has come to an end.
          This correlates precisely with cutting-edge physics, which posits that
          things in our plane of time and space are not intrinsically real but
          are manifestations of a hidden dimension where they exist in the form
          of superstrings, information fields, and energy matrices. <br />
          <br />With proof that consciousness is basic to the cosmos and
          immortal in its deeper, nonmanifest realm, Laszlo and Peake reveal the
          purpose of consciousness is to manifest in living beings in order to
          continuously evolve.

          "Ervin Laszlo with Anthony Peak take serious steps toward answering
          this grand question: does a part of our consciousness carry on after
          death and, if so, what evidence is there to support this contention?
          If taken seriously, the proof uncovered by the authors will hopefully
          shake a few foundations and lead us onto the correct path once and for
          all so that, as individuals, we might have some insight into what
          happens once the final curtain on this life comes down."
