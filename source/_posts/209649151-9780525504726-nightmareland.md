            >From a <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> insider, a mind-expanding
            exploration of sleep disorders and unusual dream states--the
            scientific explanations and the paranormal possibilities.</b
          ><br /><br />The sleeping mind is a mysterious backdrop that science
          is just beginning to shed light on. It was only some sixty years ago
          that researchers discovered REM, the rapid-eye-movement cycle that's
          associated with dreams. In <i>Nightmareland</i>, Lex "Lonehood" Nover
          travels into the eerie borderlands where the unconscious, dreams, and
          strange entities intermingle under the cover of night, revealing wider
          and hidden aspects of ourselves, from the savage and frightening to
          the astounding and sublime.<br /><br />Encompassing accepted medical
          phenomena such as sleep paralysis, parasomnias, and Ambien "zombies,"
          and the true-crime casebook of those who kill while sleepwalking, to
          supernatural elements such as the incubus, alien abduction, and
          psychic attacks, Nover brings readers on an extraordinary journey
          through history, folklore, and science, to help us understand what
          happens when we sleep.

          “This engrossing look at the stranger aspects of sleep—a state of
          being that the average person spends a third of their lives in—runs
          the gamut from night terrors to UFOs. Nover, Web producer for
          overnight radio show&nbsp;<i>Coast to Coast AM</i>, shares firsthand
          experience with sleep paralysis, during which one is fully aware of
          one’s surroundings but unable to move, often perceiving a threatening
          creature lurking in the room.<br /><br />
          Other sleep phenomena recounted here include delusional behavior among
          the chronically sleep-deprived; sightings of the “black dog” as a
          portent of approaching involuntary sleep, as described by long-haul
          truckers; and reports of nocturnal alien abductions, which, Nover
          observes, often resemble medieval accounts of demonic incubi. He also
          delves into the night terrors that occur in deep sleep, sometimes
          making people capable of feats of adrenaline-fueled strength that they
          cannot duplicate while awake.<br /><br />
          The more garden-variety—but still terrifying—phenomena of nightmares
          and fever dreams receive their full due as well. Filled with
          documented and fascinating stories of slumber gone awry and
          explanations of the science behind sleep issues, Nover’s book will be
          received by readers as a riveting invitation to sleep at one’s own
          risk.”<b

          “Check the doors, lock the windows, and keep the lights on—after
          reading Lex ‘Lonehood’ Nover’s&nbsp;<i>Nightmareland</i>, you will
          never feel the same way about sleep again. Writing with verve, wit,
          and reportorial acumen, Lex considers everything from sleep paralysis
          and dangerous sleepwalking to somnambulant murders and sleep-deprived
          hallucinations, and beyond. You’ll pray for daylight.”—<b

          <i>“Nightmareland</i>&nbsp;is the ultimate guide to the netherworlds
          of the mind, taking us on a wild ride from the dark recesses of the
          unconscious, to phantasms on the highway glowing in the light of
          oncoming trucks, to our bedroom sanctuaries, invaded by incubuses and
          aliens. A resourceful author, researcher, and storyteller, Lex is at
          ease whether diving into the subreddit boards of 2019 or pulling out
          rare nuggets from 19th-century tomes to scare, entertain, or
          illuminate us. Seasoned by his many years at&nbsp;<i

          and sleep has yielded a mind-bending page-turner.”<b>—George Noory</b
          >, host of&nbsp;<i>Coast to Coast AM<br /><br /></i
          >"Nightmareland&nbsp;was the perfect book for someone like me, who is
          fascinated by dreams and nightmares. Since I was a young teenager, I
          was blessed with having incredibly vivid dreams—sometimes too vivid.
          But this book would entertain anyone, regardless of their ability to
          remember their dreams or not."<b>—Lili Reinhart</b>, mental health
          awareness advocate and actress<br /><i><br /></i>“A mind-bending book
          about borderlands, about the nature of consciousness as borderland,
          about everything in-between that terrifies and transcends us as little
          egos. If you thought the nightmare, the sleepwalker, the zombie, the
          demon, the abduction, and the horror movie were nothing but imaginary
          fluff to be left behind in a more rational scientific age, you better
          read this book and think again. Certainly, we are not who we think we
          are. Or who we dream we are. We terrify ourselves.”—<i

          "As I devoured each page, Lex Lonehood slipped me into a warped, yet
          sober, dream state. This book is non-fiction, and this book is a
          portal. Both chilling and enlightening, I have never read words that
          transported me so vividly and deeply into another realm. Get

          well written and researched and I especially appreciate the author's

          “Lex Lonehood has clearly been paying close attention during his many
          years working for&nbsp;<i>Coast to Coast AM</i>. His new book
          "Nightmareland" is a wonderfully spooky compendium of weird phenomena,
          legends come-to-life, and real-life encounters with creatures,
          spirits, aliens, and entities. The book is a potent mix of modern
          media reports, cutting edge science, and bone-chilling lore worthy of
          John Keel and the Brothers Grimm.”<b>—George Knapp</b>, co-author
