          <p>
            In September 2023, Moumita Paul, a coach and vocal channeler, had a
            life-altering encounter with Archangel Michael. This wasn't a
            typical angelic image; this message challenged long-held beliefs and
            offered the potential to rewrite history. "Lucifer's Fall"
            chronicles that powerful channeling event, transcribed and presented
            without embellishment.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The book delves into a call to rewrite our religious history. Often
            vilified, Lucifer holds a transformative message he brought to Earth
            to help 3rd Dimensional beings like us.
            <strong
              >His message encourages embracing our inner darkness, integrating
              shadow aspects through shadow work, and ultimately, achieving
              spiritual ascension.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>In this book, you'll discover:</p>
          How did Lucifer come to Earth and WhyWhat did he do while he was
          hereHow was he framed as 'Satan'Lord Shiva's connection with the
          Annunaki (Extraterrestrial)Lucifer's true story of a 'fallen'
          archangel&nbsp;and what can you pray to him forPathways to Spiritual
          AscensionAnd much more!
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            As per Archangel Michael's message, historical narratives and
            religious texts will undergo widespread changes in the coming years
            through Moumita and other channels.

          <p><strong>About the Author:</strong></p>
          <p>
            The book is considered one of Moumita's most significant channelings
            in 2023 and offers a fresh perspective on human history. Since 2023,
            <strong
              >Moumita has channeled various entities, including Archangel
              Michael, Yeshua, Mary Magdalene, the Arcturian Council, HOD (God
              of technology), and Lemurians</strong
            >. Beyond channeling, she has developed a self-healing modality
            using EFT, self-love, and parts work, empowering individuals with
            holistic wellness tools.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Moumita differs from the traditional Christian path. Though having
            studied in a Catholic school, she doesn't identify as Christian or
            read the Bible. Archangel Michael cited the potential biases
            stemming from religious indoctrination in most Christian channels as
            the reason for choosing her. These biases can alter or filter the
            information coming through. The book's message supports personal
            development, self-awareness, and self-love as paths to spiritual
            growth.

          <p><strong>What is Channeling?</strong></p>
          <p>
            For those unfamiliar, vocal channeling is the telepathic
            transmission of information from non-physical entities through a
            human medium.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
