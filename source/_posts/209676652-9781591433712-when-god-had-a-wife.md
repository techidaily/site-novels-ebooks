          Reveals the tradition of goddess worship in early Judaism and how
          Jesus attempted to restore the feminine side of the faith
          <br /><br />• Provides historical and archaeological evidence for an
          earlier form of Hebrew worship with both male and female gods,
          including a 20th-century discovery of a Hebrew temple dedicated to
          both Yahweh and the warrior goddess Anat <br /><br />• Explores the
          Hebrew pantheon of goddesses, including Yahweh’s wife, Asherah,
          goddess of fertility and childbirth <br /><br />• Shows how both Jesus
          and his great rival Simon Magus were attempting to restore the
          ancient, goddess-worshipping religion of the Israelites
          <br /><br />Despite what Jews and Christians--and indeed most
          people--believe, the ancient Israelites venerated several deities
          besides the Old Testament god Yahweh, including the goddess Asherah,
          Yahweh’s wife, who was worshipped openly in the Jerusalem Temple.
          After the reforms of King Josiah and Prophet Jeremiah, the religion
          recognized Yahweh alone, and history was rewritten to make it appear
          that it had always been that way. The worship of Asherah and other
          goddesses was now heresy, and so the status of women was downgraded
          and they were blamed for God’s wrath. <br /><br />However, as Lynn
          Picknett and Clive Prince reveal, the spiritual legacy of the Jewish
          goddesses and the Sacred Feminine lives on. Drawing on historical
          research, they examine how goddess worship thrived in early Judaism
          and included a pantheon of goddesses. They share new evidence for an
          earlier form of Hebrew worship that prayed to both male and female
          gods, including a 20th-century archaeological discovery of a Hebrew
          temple dedicated to both Yahweh and the goddess Anat. Uncovering the
          Sacred Feminine in early Christianity, the authors show how, in the
          first century AD, both Jesus and his great rival, Simon Magus, were
          attempting to restore the goddess-worshipping religion of the
          Israelites. The authors reveal how both men accorded great honor to
          the women they adored and who traveled with them as priestesses,
          Jesus’s Mary Magdalene and Simon’s Helen. But, as had happened
          centuries before, the Church rewrote history to erase the feminine
          side of the faith, deliberately ignoring Jesus’s real message and
          again condemning women to marginalization and worse.
          <br /><br />Providing all the necessary evidence to restore the
          goddess to both Judaism and Christianity, Picknett and Prince expose
          the disastrous consequences of the suppression of the feminine from
          these two great religions and reveal how we have been collectively and
          instinctively craving the return of the Sacred Feminine for millennia.
