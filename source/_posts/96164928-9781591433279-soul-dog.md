          An exploration of animal spirituality and the ability of animals to
          communicate with humans even in the afterlife <br /><br />• 2019
          Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold Award and Industry Choice and
          Peoples Choice Award <br /><br />• Chronicles the author’s profound
          relationship with her dog, Brio, his ability to read her mind and
          emotions, and the messages she received from him after his death
          <br /><br />• Shares the author’s research with animal communicators,
          psychics, and scientists specializing in animal intelligence such as
          Rupert Sheldrake <br /><br />• Explores animals’ thoughts and
          feelings, interspecies communication and telepathy, animal souls and
          the afterlife, and animal reincarnation <br /><br />• Paper with
          French flaps <br /><br />Looking for companionship after a near-fatal
          car crash, Elena Mannes, an award-winning television journalist and
          producer, decided to get her first dog. But what she found with her
          dog Brio shook the foundations of her physical and spiritual worlds,
          sending her on a quest to discover the nature of his spiritual origins
          and to contemplate and seek out the possibility of interspecies
          communication--even after death. <br /><br />Soon after bringing her
          puppy home, Mannes realized that the master-companion relationship
          would not be possible with Brio, who quickly showed that he had a
          mind--and a spirit--of his own. A healer Mannes visited immediately
          focused on Brio, exclaiming that he was an old soul. Mannes’s growing
          curiosity about the intelligence, emotions, and consciousness of Brio
          and other dogs led her to contact an animal psychic in California who
          described, with amazing accuracy, Brio’s favorite walks and the
          author’s apartment from the dog’s point of view. Motivated by her
          experience, Mannes produced a filmed segment with Diane Sawyer
          featuring the same psychic, who described Sawyer’s country house and
          her dog’s favorite spots in the yard. Mannes’s skeptical journalist
          background compelled her to investigate further. She delved into the
          world of animal communicators, psychics, and scientists studying
          animal intelligence, including Rupert Sheldrake, to find answers to
          her multiplying questions: Do animals have thoughts and feelings?
          Consciousness? Souls? Is interspecies communication possible? Can
          animals reincarnate? <br /><br />Spanning the entire life and
          afterlife of Brio, including his last days and his messages to the
          author after he passed on, this book also explores Mannes’
          investigations into the spiritual life of animals, offering a new
          understanding of the unbreakable bond between humans and animals.
          Mannes invites readers to move beyond the owner-pet relationship and
          shows us how to see animals as thinking, feeling, spiritual beings
          whose connections with us extend far beyond life and death.
