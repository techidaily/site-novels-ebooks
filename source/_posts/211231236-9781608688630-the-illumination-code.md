          <br />
          Intuition — the extraordinary ability to access information from the
          quantum realms — is fast becoming humanity’s most advanced form of
          knowledge acquisition. The Illumination Code presents seven keys to
          unlock your inner dimension so you can access expanded states of
          awareness that exist beyond the limits of the rational mind. Kim
          Chestney reveals the deeply personal nature of the universe while
          offering a new way to know the unknowable and experience the seemingly
          impossible. As you venture inward on this step-by-step journey, you
          will gain profound insights and discover the true power of your own
          inner wisdom.<br />

          “The Illumination Code helps us overcome the two fundamental fallacies
          of the modern age: that the world we experience with our eyes and ears
          is all there is, and that it is basically random, happening without
          rhyme or reason. The truly real world is not random but highly tuned —
          oriented to its own evolution and so to the evolution of all things in
          it, ourselves included. The world of the quantum sciences is a
          ‘natural miracle.’ The key to comprehending it lies within us.
          Einstein once said that there are just two ways we can live our life:
          as if nothing is a miracle or as if everything is. This book tells us
          that everything is a miracle — a ‘fathomable’ not an unfathomable
          miracle. Kim Chestney’s codes bring you closer to the comprehension of
          a reality that was wholly hidden prior to the quantum discoveries —
          and is now only partially hidden. What we learn in this book about the
          real world — which is not the world of everyday sensory experience but
          much more — is a true ‘aha experience.’ We have intuited something
          like this in our moments of insight and revelation, but now the
          miracle is offered to us with a scientific background. The revelations
          of the sciences are strange but not new. Insightful people have always
          known them. We are the greatest miracle — each of us a miraculous
          conscious being in a miraculous consciousness-imbued and
          consciousness-radiating universe.”<br />

          “The Illumination Code is a dynamic guide to self-discovery and
          spiritual growth. This is not a passive self-help book but one that
          encourages the reader to be proactive. Each of the seven keys involves
          engaging exercises designed to expand the reader’s intuitive
          abilities. One of the many virtues of this book is that it is not
          written from a fluffy, New Age perspective but from a down-to-earth,
          rational perspective. Kim Chestney expertly incorporates quantum
          physics not as a cold, distant exercise of academia but rather as a
          very up-close-and-personal force that both touches and connects all of
          us. I highly recommend this book.”<br />

          “Kim Chestney, the queen of intuition, has crafted an extraordinary
          masterpiece with her latest book, The Illumination Code. This is a
          transformative treasure chest filled with profound perspectives that
          will challenge any outdated beliefs and elevate every spiritual
          journey. It equips readers to embrace their power, trusting in their
          innate abilities and embarking on a transformative journey toward
          higher consciousness. With a unique blend of personal experiences and
          profound perspectives, Kim weaves a beautiful tapestry that goes
          beyond a mere reading experience. Its powerful lab tools further
          amplify its brilliance, igniting a spark that illuminates every aspect
          of life. The Illumination Code is undeniably a gift to humanity and an
          absolute must-read!”<br />

          “The Illumination Code is true to its name: it has illuminated a path
          for me to feel connected and one with the universe and the loving
          guidance that it contains for me. By supporting ancient spiritual
          teachings with a scientific foundation, especially recent discoveries
          in quantum physics, Kim Chestney has opened a portal to accessing and
          mastering one’s intuition and feeling connected with the infinite.”<br />

          “Kim Chestney brings intuition into the mainstream by weaving together
          Western science and Eastern philosophies. Like Kim herself, her books
          are engaging, authentic, and life-changing. I highly recommend
          both! ”<br />
          <strong>— Carin Lockhart, yogi and author of Joinings</strong><br />

          “In The Illumination Code Kim Chestney has taken the foundational
          intuition principles she established in Radical Intuition to the next
          level. She has written a master class on how quantum physics and
          natural laws unlock the transformational power of intuition for
          everyone.”<br />

          “Kim Chestney takes us on a journey to embrace a whole new way of
          living that is full of wonder, guidance, magic, and empowerment. The
          Illumination Code is a remarkable book that bridges the worlds of
          science, spirituality, and the New Age seamlessly: a true work of
          quantum activism.”<br />
