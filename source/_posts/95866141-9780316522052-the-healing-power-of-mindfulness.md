          <b>Discover how mindfulness can help you with healing.</b><br /><br />
          More than twenty years ago, Jon Kabat-Zinn showed us the value of
          cultivating greater awareness in everyday life with his now-classic
          introduction to mindfulness, <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are</i>.
          Now, in <i>TheHealing Power of Mindfulness</i>, he shares a cornucopia
          of specificexamples as to how the cultivation of mindfulness can
          reshape your relationship with your own body and mind--explaining what
          we're learning about neuroplasticity and the brain, how meditation can
          affect our biology and our health, and what mindfulness can teach us
          about coming to terms with all sorts of life challenges, including our
          own mortality, so we can make the most of the moments that we have.
          <br /><br />
          Originally published in 2005 as part of a larger book titled
          <i>Coming to Our Senses</i>,
          <i>The Healing Power of Mindfulness </i> features a new foreword by
          the author and timely updates throughout the text. If you are
          interested in learning more about how mindfulness as a way of being
          can help us to heal, physically and emotionally, look no further than
          this deeply personal and also "deeply optimistic book, grounded in
          good science and filled with practical recommendations for moving in
          the right direction" (Andrew Weil, MD), from one of the pioneers of
          the worldwide mindfulness movement.
