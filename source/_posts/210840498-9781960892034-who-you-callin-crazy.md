            "Hi, my name is Juliet and I'm a therapist who goes to therapy."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This is THE book that finally peels back the curtain, mystery, and
            stigma around supporting your mental health journey!
          </p>
          <p>
            From this first line on,&nbsp;Who You Callin' Crazy?!&nbsp;is
            honest, real, and relatable. Juliet, founder and owner of Sun
            Counseling and Wellness and practicing therapist for over a decade,
            is on a mission to end the stigma around therapy and to normalize
            and elevate the dialogue around mental health. Inspired by the
            collective experience we all had during the peak of the COVID-19
            pandemic, she wrote this book to make our understanding and
            ownership of how we struggle more than just a moment, but a
            movement: a movement to support each other in feeling less shame and
            judgment, and find pathways to more healing, growth, and balance.
            This is an easy to follow reference guide of sorts with helpful
            scripts and understandable takeaways. Juliet has organized the book
            into three parts and encourages readers to jump in wherever they are
            on their mental health journey:
          </p>
          <strong>Part 1: Who You Callin' Crazy?!</strong>Unpacking myths and
          misconceptions about mental health, understanding its stigma, and
          claiming-or reclaiming-what mental health means to you.<strong
            >Part 2: Maybe I&nbsp;Should&nbsp;Go To Therapy</strong
          >Answering common questions about therapy and seeking support, like
          what therapy actually is, what are the common misconceptions, how to
          know it's time to go to therapy, how to find a therapist, how to know
          a therapist is a good fit, how to break up with a therapist, and much
          more.<strong>Part 3: Yep, I Go To Therapy</strong>A deeper dive into
          practical tips and takeaways for improving self-awareness; a little
          taste of therapy, if you will, that you can take back to your own
          therapist.

            through in the way she wrote this book. There are 3 parts to the
            book that correlate to the journey to therapy so its helpful for
            anyone wherever they are on this journey. I'm blessed to be a
