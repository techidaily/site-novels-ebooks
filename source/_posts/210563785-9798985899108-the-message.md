              thousands of individuals to re-connect with their own internal

          "In The Message: A Guide to Being Human, LD Thompson has given us one
          of the most relevant books for these times; a must-have guide. In
          concise, clear, and inspired language, he speaks to the heart of our
          real human challenges and gives a gift of wisdom ... soothing our
          fears, dispelling confusion, and making clear the profoundly simple
          way forward for us individually and collectively. This book is never
          far from my desk or bedside. I love it."

          "The Message: A Guide to Being Human is a master class for personal
          and global transformation. It is filled with powerful lessons to
          navigate the changes we are all experiencing inside our minds, our
          hearts... and our world. I was deeply moved by the skill and patience
          that led me to a shift in awareness that literally changed my
          perception of reality. This is a jewel of a book that you will open
          time and time again for reference and solace during this era of great
          uncertainty and discord on the planet."

          "LD Thompson's book The Message: A Guide to Being Human is a
          remarkable achievement. It is more than a guide to being human - it is
          a deeply felt and wise journey into the inner-most reaches of the
          soul. The voice of the sage Solano, as told through the author,
          resonates with simple good sense and quiet authority. I was truly
          moved by this book. As a manual for lifemanship in the 21st century,
          The Message cannot be bettered."

          instructions in The Message: A Guide to Being Human. This well
          laid-out soul master plan comes with a student, LD. His stories reveal
          his reverence and humility as the pupil and vessel of the messages."
