            >THE RUNAWAY <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER - AS HEARD ON NPR
            <i>MORNING EDITION</i> AND <i>ON BEING</i> WITH KRISTA TIPPETT<br /><br />“Katherine
            May opens up exactly what I and so many need to hear but haven't
            known how to name.”&nbsp;—Krista Tippett, <i>On Being</i
            ><br /><br />“Every bit as beautiful and healing as the season
            itself. . . . This is truly a beautiful book.”&nbsp;—Elizabeth
            Gilbert&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />"Proves that there is grace in
            letting go, stepping back and giving yourself time to repair in the
            dark...May is a clear-eyed observer and her language is steady,
            honest and accurate—capturing the sense, the beauty and the latent
            power of our resting landscapes." <i>—Wall Street Journal</i
            ><br /><br />From the bestselling author of the
            <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
            <i>Enchantment: Awakening Wonder in an Anxious Age</i>, this is an
            intimate, revelatory exploration of the ways we can care for and
            repair ourselves when life knocks us down.<br /></b
          ><br />
          Sometimes you slip through the cracks: unforeseen circumstances like
          an abrupt illness, the death of a loved one, a break up, or a job loss
          can derail a life. These periods of dislocation can be lonely and
          unexpected. For May, her husband fell ill, her son stopped attending
          school, and her own medical issues led her to leave a demanding job.
          <i>Wintering</i> explores how she not only endured this painful time,
          but embraced the singular opportunities it offered.<br /><br />A
          moving personal narrative shot through with lessons from literature,
          mythology, and the natural world, May's story offers instruction on
          the transformative power of rest and retreat. Illumination emerges
          from many sources: solstice celebrations and dormice hibernation, C.S.
          Lewis and Sylvia Plath, swimming in icy waters and sailing arctic
          seas. <br /><br />Ultimately <i>Wintering</i> invites us to change how
          we relate to our own fallow times. May models an active acceptance of
          sadness and finds nourishment in deep retreat, joy in the hushed
          beauty of winter, and encouragement in understanding life as cyclical,
          not linear. A secular mystic, May forms a guiding philosophy for
          transforming the hardships that arise before the ushering in of a new
          season.

          opens up exactly what I and so many need to hear but haven’t known how
          to name.” <b>–&nbsp;Krista Tippett, On Being</b><br /><br />“There is
          power and clarity and wisdom to be gained from accepting these
          difficult times. Wintering offered me&nbsp;empathy, acceptance and
          perspective that will stay with me long after the pandemic.” –

          sympathetic...proves that there is grace in letting go, stepping back
          and giving yourself time to repair in the dark...May is a clear-eyed
          observer and her language is steady, honest and accurate—capturing the

          <b>–&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i></b

          &nbsp;<br />“Wintering&nbsp;succeeds in delivering a powerful,
          realtime account of what it is to experience life's inevitable winters
          — both literal and metaphorical — and come out on the other side. I
          can think of no more valuable voice to have in your ear as we stumble
          our way out of a pandemic and emerge from a collective wintering.” –

          hardship.” <b><i>– People Magazine</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Wintering</i>&nbsp;is every bit as beautiful and
          healing as the season itself. Katherine May thoughtfully examines the
          emotional, spiritual, and geographical reality of the cold times, the
          dark days, and those periods of our lives when things are neither soft
          nor easy. In so doing, she offers a great and humane service to her
          readers: she shows us that wintering cannot be avoided, but need not
          be feared. This is truly a beautiful book.”&nbsp;<b

          perfectly timed hug you didn’t know you needed, a warm blanket on a
          cold day. So many books about adversity focus on ways to get away from
          the discomfort, and this book so wonderfully and sincerely says it's
          okay to be here, even when it hurts. It's exactly what the world needs
