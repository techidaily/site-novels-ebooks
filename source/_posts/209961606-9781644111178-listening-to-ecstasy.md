          A personal narrative and guide to the safe, responsible use of MDMA
          for personal healing and social transformation <br /><br />• Details
          the author’s 50 years of responsible experimentation with
          mind-altering substances and how Ecstasy has helped him become a
          better therapist <br /><br />• Explains how he and his wife found
          Ecstasy to be the key to renewing and enriching their lives and
          marriage as they entered their senior years <br /><br />• Describes
          what the experience actually feels like and provides protocols for the
          safe, responsible, recreational, and celebrational use of MDMA for
          individuals and groups <br /><br />In a world that keeps us separate
          from each other, MDMA is the chemical of connection. Aptly known in
          popular culture as “Ecstasy,” MDMA helps us rediscover our own true
          loving nature, often obscured by the traumas of life. On its way to
          becoming a prescription medication due to groundbreaking research on
          its use to treat PTSD, Ecstasy can offer benefits for all adult life
          stages, from 20-somethings to seniors. <br /><br />In this memoir and
          guide to safe use, Charles Wininger, a licensed psychoanalyst and
          mental health counselor, details the countless ways that Ecstasy has
          helped him become a better therapist and husband. He recounts his
          coming of age in the 1960s counterculture, his 50 years of responsible
          experimentation with mind-altering substances, and his immersion in
          the new psychedelic renaissance. He explains how he and his wife found
          Ecstasy to be the key to renewing and enriching their lives as they
          entered their senior years. It also strengthened the bonds of their
          marriage. <br /><br />Countering the fearful propaganda that surrounds
          this drug, Wininger describes what the experience actually feels like
          and explores the value of Ecstasy and similar substances for helping
          psychologically healthy individuals live a more “optimal” life. He
          provides protocols for the responsible, recreational, and
          celebrational use of MDMA, including how to perfect the experience,
          maximize the benefits and minimize the risks, and how it may not be
          for everyone. He reveals how MDMA has revitalized his marriage, both
          erotically and emotionally, and describes how pleasure, fun, and joy
          can be profound bonding and transformative experiences.
          <br /><br />Revealing MDMA’s versatility when it comes to bringing
          lasting renewal, pleasure, and inspiration to one’s life, Wininger
          shows that recognizing the transformative power of happiness-inducing
          experiences can be the first step on the path to healing.
