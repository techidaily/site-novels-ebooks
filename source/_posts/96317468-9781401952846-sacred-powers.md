            >Have you ever found yourself at a crossroads, unsure of which way
            to turn? Maybe you reached a fork in the road and felt overwhelmed
            by the choices before you. Or perhaps you felt stuck, held back by
            the fear of making the wrong decision—with one foot rooted firmly in
            the past and the other dangling into the unknown.</b
          ><br /><br />But there is a pathway out of your challenges and into a
          space of freedom, happiness, and lasting fulfillment. For thousands of
          years, divine solutions have been whispered directly into the hearts
          of priests, shamans, wizards, medicine women, and healers.<br /><br />In
          <i>Sacred Powers</i>, internationally renowned meditation master
          davidji reveals the deepest secrets of this timeless wisdom and
          distills their essence into the Five Divine Principles of the
          Universe:<br /><br />· The Divine Principle of One<br />· The Divine
          Principle of Awareness<br />· The Divine Principle of Rebirth<br />·
          The Divine Principle of Infinite Flow<br />· The Divine Principle of
          Inner Fire<br /><br />Each step on the path will unfold eternal truths
          to guide you on a lifelong journey of clarity and connection,
          expansion and abundance, love and happiness, courage and confidence,
          and passion and purpose. This moment is a defining moment.
          <i>This </i>is the moment to awaken your sacred powers. And
          <i>this </i>is the time to manifest your dream life!

          "Bright light, fully alive, wide awake, and overflowing with
          passion—these are just a few of the phrases I’d use to describe
          davidji. In Sacred Powers, you’ll learn exactly what you need to do to
          emulate these beautiful qualities. You’d be hard pressed to find a
          better guide for this life-changing, transformational journey!"<br />—
          <b>Cheryl Richardson</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>The Art of Extreme Self-Care</i><br /><br />"When I read the first
          few pages of <i>Sacred Powers</i>, I was reminded of the very first
          time I encountered the joyful and brilliant davidji! It was a special
          moment for both of us—we felt an immediate soul connection and knew we
          would be collaborating for years to come. davidji has tapped into the
          secret of slipping into the stillness, where all things become crystal
          clear, and possibilities are limitless. <i>Sacred Powers</i> will
          resonate with anyone who finds themselves occasionally overwhelmed by
          daily challenges, with the nagging certainty that there ‘must be
          something more.’"<br />— <b>James Van Praagh</b>,
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of
          <i>Wisdom from Your Spirit Guides<br /></i><br />"<i>Sacred Powers</i>
          is essential reading for any serious seeker on the path of
          transformation. davidji is one of my favorite human beings on the
          planet, and has my deepest respect as a truly authentic and brilliant
          guide and teacher. This clear, intelligent, and exquisitely written
          book will serve as your new, delightful, and wise companion on the
          journey toward awakening."<br />— <b>Dr. Barbara De Angelis</b>, #1
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Soul Shifts </i>and
          <i>The Choice for Love<br /></i><br />"While our experiences are all
          subjective and totally unique, there’s always a truth concerning the
          objective framework of how and why our lives go the way they do. Enter
          my friend, davidji, a wayfinder and mystic who has a most
          extraordinary grip on the truths that transcend both the objective and
          subjective worlds. His depth of experiences and tenacity of spirit
          have made him one of the pioneers of our time into all things body,
          mind, and spirit. As you feel his energy through his words, you too
          will know you’ve found a friend."<br />— <b>Mike Dooley</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>From Deep Space with Love<br /></i><br />"Get ready to live the
          life you were meant to be living! davidji’s personal transformation is
          a story that will have you tearing through this book at record speed,
          but it’s the tools for personal transformation that will make you want
          to slow down and re-experience it over and over again. This is the
          real deal, filled with ancient wisdom modernized and directional moves
          to help you reach elevated states of consciousness and your full
          potential. <i>Sacred Powers</i> will amplify your heart, energy, and

          page of <i>Sacred Powers</i>. He is a master storyteller, a beautiful
          wordsmith, who draws on a lifetime of spiritual adventures to help you
          say yes to your spiritual journey."<br />— <b>Robert Holden</b>,
