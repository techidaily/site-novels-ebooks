            The Zodiac and the Salts of Salvation is a two-part work by frequent
            collaborators Dr. George Washington Carey (1845-1924) and Inez
            Eudora Perry (1871-1961). This book explores the use of certain
            minerals called "cell-salts" to cure disease and how one's Zodiac
            sign impacts their cell-salt deficiencies.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Dr. Carey was a homeopath whose theories of biochemistry had their
            foundation in the work of Dr. Wilhelm Heinrich Schubler. Dr.
            Schubler and his predecessors had developed the concept of
            cell-salts - naturally occurring minerals - to supplement
            deficiencies in the human body, thus curing disease and ailments.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Carey agreed with this idea. He proposed that illness cannot be
            cured by removal of some poison, but can only be remedied by adding
            some necessary element, some food, to the human body to restore
            balance.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Dr. Carey's unique contribution to the field of biochemistry was to
            connect each of the twelve cell-salts with a particular sign of the
            Zodiac. In his pamphlet The Relation of Mineral Salts to the Body
            and to the Signs of the Zodiac, Carey describes the characteristics
            of each Zodiac sign, their Biblical connection through a
            corresponding son of Jacob and disciple of Christ, and the cell salt
            in which they are often deficient.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Those born under the sign of Aries, for example, "are natural
            doubters until they figure a thing out for themselves." The
            associated cell-salt is potassium phosphate, "the greatest healing
            agent known to man, because it is the chemical base of material
            expression and understanding."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            While Dr. Carey's work on mineral salts and the Zodiac is
            foundational, it is also largely theoretical. After Dr. Carey's
            death in 1924, collaborator Inez Eudora Perry republished The
            Relation of Mineral Salts to the Body and to the Signs of the
            Zodiac, and supplemented it with an additional work of her own that
            expounded on Dr. Carey's ideas. The resulting work was published in
            1932 as The Zodiac and the Salts of Salvation.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Perry's contribution is titled An Esoteric Analysis and Synthesis of
            the Zodiacal Signs and their Physiochemical Allocations. Part two is
            much longer than part one, with thorough explanations of both the
            symbolism and practical uses of each cell-salt.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            She also explores more thoroughly the connection of the Zodiac to
            the body of man - comparing the macrocosm of the universe to the
            microcosm of the human body. Aries, the Ram, is associated with the
            human head. As the highest part of the body, the head is the place
            of ascension and elevation. It contains the brain, the organ that
            separates man from beast.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Carey and Perry work through the entire Zodiac, explaining the
            symbolism of each sign and relating it to the greater universe,
            different cultural traditions including Christianity and eastern
            philosophy, the human body, and the human mind. The combination of
            the two parts is of enormous value - Dr. Carey's Relation of Mineral
            Salts as an introduction, and Ms. Perry's Esoteric Analysis for a
            more thorough and comprehensible explanation.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            This book is still popular among homeopathic circles, and the
            cell-salts, sometimes called tissue salts, are used frequently in
            alternative medicine.
