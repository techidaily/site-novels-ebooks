            This twenty-year study of astrology in the lives of people and the
            planet shows how to free prejudice and reveal clear ways to happier
            lives.&nbsp;

          <p>
            It is an anthology of key passages from articles, originally
            published in the bi-monthly Astrological Journal between March 2002
            and July 2021, re-proofed, with style/syntax improvements, and then
            laid out afresh with a commentary overview, alongside details
            and&nbsp;images of contemporary events. These include
            astro-cycle-related commentaries on the development and consequences
            of the Iraq War, the Arab Spring and its aftermath, ongoing economic
            crises and the radical changes indicated to resolve them, the 2008
            and 2012 Olympic Games, elections and leadership - especially in the
            United Kingdom and the United States of America, Brexit, Covid-19
            and more. It concludes by describing the likely timing and nature of
            any recovery. All is assessed in the context of many hundreds, even
            thousands, of years of predictably repeating astrological
            cycles.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Read the extracts, alongside the events they refer to. Does
            astrology offer universal understanding? Decide for yourself whether
            'the scientific expertise of the modern mind can be combined with
            the intelligent soul language of astrology, along with compassion,
            to form a stable three-legged stool, upon which we can base a much
            happier future.'
