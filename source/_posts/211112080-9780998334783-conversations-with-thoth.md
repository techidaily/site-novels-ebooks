            "We begin! Close your eyes so you can hear. Listen carefully. It is
            I, Thoth, your trusted associate..." And so began the journey of a
            lifetime for Pat Heydlauff, renowned thought leader, Feng Shui
            expert, and author. Now she invites you to travel with her to the
            Library of Wisdom and Knowledge and learn from Thoth, a god of high
            rank in the Ancient Egyptian hierarchy.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            What began as a typical journaling session one morning quickly
            evolved into a one-on-one conversation into the mysteries of the
            universe, the state of the human condition, and the lessons all
            people must learn to transform their world and their life. Over the
            course of several months, Pat traveled with Thoth and witnessed a
            world of possibilities in terms of technology, healthcare,
            community, and so much more. Now she is sharing Thoth's message of
            peace, hope, and transformation so people can gain wisdom, live
            their truth, and finally experience unconditional love.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Join her on this amazing journey. Close your eyes so you can hear.
            Open your heart so you can see. Experience the journey of a lifetime
            as only Thoth can show you.

          "After reading Looking Within [the book Thoth refers to often] written
          by Pat Heydlauff, I purchased numerous copies to give as a gift to
          each of our employees. No matter one's situation or current
          difficulties, or just for self-improvement, this book aids the reader
          to reconnect with oneself in order to find a path of peace, calmness,
          and understanding of self. It's recognized that you can't depend on
          others for happiness but rather find happiness from within. Pat
          consistently focuses on the core 7 principles of aiding the reader to
          become or stay aligned in finding one's inner peace. Her message will
          help people embrace oneself to truly accept oneself.&nbsp;Thank you,
          Pat Heydlauff, for writing this book. Well done!"
