              >Author Beverly Conyers—one of the most respected voices in
              wellness and recovery—has guided hundreds of thousands of readers
              through the process of recognizing family roles in addiction,
              healing shame, building healthy relationships, releasing trauma,
              focusing on emotional sobriety, as well as acknowledging
              self-sabotaging behaviors, addictive tendencies, and substance use
              patterns. With her newest work, Conyers shows us how the practice
              of mindfulness can be a game-changing part of recovering from any-
              and everything</b
            >.</b
          ><br /><br />Early in our recovery journey, we focused on healing.
          Further along in the process of recovering, we dare to believe it’s
          possible to embark on a new chapter, but often feel stuck. At times,
          we wonder…how do we create the breakthroughs we want?<br />
          <br />
          With a mindfulness practice—meditation and other habits of
          awareness—we develop the courage to look within. As we hold space for
          ourselves, we find the light within that can spark change, personal
          growth, and self-compassion. Mindfulness is an irreplaceable part of
          the health and healing toolkit because it illuminates our true selves;
          as a result, it illuminates our recovery.<br />
          <br />
          Conyers gives us an approachable mindfulness book with carefully
          designed reflections and practices that set us on a path forward. Her
          insight guides our way whether recovering from unhealthy
          relationships, addictions of all types, compulsive habits, anxiety and
          stress, workaholism, disordered eating, or mental health and emotional
          challenges—and whether we follow the Twelve Steps or not.<br />
          <br />
          Discover why Beverly Conyers’ books have been a mainstay for support
          groups the world over, and why so many have turned to her insights and
          guidance. As the author of the recovery classic
          <i>Addict in the Family</i>, she has inspired hope and healing in a
          way few others have managed to match.

        <p>
          Find Your Light is a short but powerful book that focuses on
          integrating mindfulness practices within the Twelve Step programs.
          Published by Hazelden Press, it is part of their literature dedicated
          to the recovery movement. It can be a helpful work for those involved
          in a personal recovery process who find the traditional
          Christian-focused language of the 12-step movement uncomfortable. The
          author does an excellent job of introducing simple mindfulness
          practices (meditation, compassion, being in the present moment) in a
          way that will enhance and supplement 12-step practices. Resources and
          practices that the reader can follow are provided as well. The author
          uses personal examples from her life as well as quotes from both
          recovery and mindfulness literature to help the reader learn more
          about the steps she advises. I think this will be a very useful books
          if one is interested in a 12-step program but not comfortable with
          Christian or traditionally religious language.&nbsp; 5 out of 5 stars
