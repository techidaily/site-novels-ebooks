          <p>Magnify your potential; not your problems. - Jacqueline</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            All DESIRES you seek come from abundance, also known as alignment.
            How can you access your potential and create The Good Life?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            GET TO GOOD shows you how to access personal alignment using
            profound lifestyle conditioning for accelerated abundance. With this
            book as your guide, you will be able to get out of your own way, get
            off it and Get to Good. Once you know how to access your personal
            alignment, you will begin to experience more of the good life, as
            defined by you. Jacqueline invites you to Get to Good, allowing your
            potential to come out and play today. Why not take the shortcut to
            abundance and feel good now? What are you waiting for? Permission
            granted!
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you ever wonder why some days are better than others? Think
            having the good life is really coincidence, luck and favoritism? As
            the fortuneteller of your life, you get whatever you think about
            whether you want it or not. A belief or mantra is a conditioned
            thought; what have you been thinking lately? Does it serve you? If
            you continue to tell the story of what is then you cannot give your
            attention to what you want. Your current state of affairs does not
            have to be your consistent reality. Reality is nothing more than
            what is currently occupying your mind and captivating your
            attention. When you give attention to your desires and feel good now
            before the evidence of your desires show up, you end up taking the
            shortcut to the good life. The only reason you do not choose to Get
            to Good now is because you give more attention to your sophisticated
            excuses than your potential. With a little bit of practice and
            insight, you will find yourself choosing alignment for the pure sake
            of alignment. The intention behind Get to Good is personal alignment
            for accelerated abundance in every area of your life. Take a moment
            to imagine the possibilities of you being aligned in your spirit,
            health, finances, relationships, career and purpose in life. You are
            going to read it, hear it, say, think and see it abundantly so it
            becomes a mantra for life: Get to Good!
