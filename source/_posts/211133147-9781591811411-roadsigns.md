        </h4>
        <p>
          Like the Dodgers, Philip Goldberg was born in Brooklyn and now makes
          his home in Los Angeles. After receiving a BA in Psychology from the
          City University of New York, he did graduate studies at the New School
          for Social Research and was a teaching associate at Northeastern
          University. Feeling a call to higher wisdom, he left academia and
          plunged into a path of self-education in metaphysics. He spent the
          first half of the 1970s teaching Transcendental Meditation, lecturing,
          and leading retreats. He helped start Maharishi International
          University, obtained an MA in Interdisciplinary Education in the
          process, and later served as Director of Curriculum Development. He
          has authored or coauthored 16 nonfiction books, including The
          Intuitive Edge, which has been called the definitive book on
          intuition, Executive Health, Making Peace with Your Past, the
          best-selling Get Out of Your Own Way, and Making Peace with God, about
          overcoming the psychospiritual obstacles to intimacy with the Divine.
          His work has been featured in leading magazines and newspapers,
          including The Los Angeles Times, Prevention, Cosmopolitan, and Ladies’
          Home Journal. He also writes fiction and screenplays; his novel, This
          Is Next Year, published in 1992, is now in development as a feature
          film. Over the years, Phil has lectured widely on topics related to
          spirituality, health, and human development, and has appeared on
          numerous television and radio shows, including The Today Show. He
          continues to lecture and lead workshops on a variety of topics related
          to living 200% of life-100% spiritual and 100% material. He is
          ordained as an Interfaith Minister. He founded Spiritual Wellness
          Associates Network (SWAN), which is dedicated to helping individuals
          create healthy, vital spiritual lives. He maintains a spiritual
          counseling practice in Los Angeles and he teaches meditation and a
          variety of mind-body practices geared to each client’s developmental
          needs. Phil is a founding director of the Forge Institute, a
          non-profit institution dedicated to fostering a renaissance of
          spiritual wisdom. He is the Director of the Forge Guild, a consortium
          of spiritual leaders and teachers from all paths who come together to
          grow professionally and personally. You can contact him at
