          ><br /><br />Do you want to be known as a tremendous
          talent&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or a lazy, unfocused slacker? Whether
          you’re a Millennial yearning to join corporate America, a Boomer ready
          for reinvention, a closeted LGBTQ+ individual, or even a nerd
          nauseated with perfection, this in-your-face, funny, no-nonsense,
          socio-business, coming-of-ageless handbook can help you find true,
          inner-personal success.<br /><br />Inside, you’ll learn ten easy
          steps, such as:<br /><br />• Work on Your Work Ethic<br /><br />• Own
          the Power of Thoughtfulness<br /><br />• Find Perfection in

          book is based on Loeber’s quirky personal life experiences that all
          started in 1970s, disco-era New York City. Justin worked as a waiter,
          a Wang Word Processing Operator, (remember Wang?), a substitute go-go
          dancer, and was discovered by pop icon Gary Numan in London. He was
          one step from stardom in his own right as a solo pop-recording
          artist—only to lose it all. Then, in a 180-degree turn—and without a
          college degree—went from a temp at Random House to an executive vice
          president at HarperCollins in a little more than a decade. In 2006,
          Loeber created mouth: digital + public relations, a boutique agency in
          NYC—repping over 550 clients to date.<br /><br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Justin Loeber is a self-made entrepreneur with a true American spirit.
          Starting as a temp at 33, and without a college degree, Loeber rose up
          the ranks in publishing in a little more than a decade because “[he]
          was organized, had a big mouth and knew how to type.” His PR career
          germinated in corporate publishing?first as an Assistant at
          Villard/Random House, then as a Publicist at William Morrow/Hearst,
          Senior Publicist at Broadway Books/BDD, a Director of Publicity at
          Running Press Book Publishers, a PR Director at Ecco/HarperCollins, a
          VP/Director of Publicity at Atria/Simon and Schuster, and finally as
          an SVP, Executive Marketing and Publicity Director at Judith Regan’s
          imprint, ReganMedia/HarperCollins. Loeber has spearheaded publicity
          campaigns for a ton of bold face names: Michael Jordan, Lawrence
          Taylor, Cindy Crawford, Olympia Dukakis, Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson,
          Anthony Bourdain, Ewan McGregor, Gloria Allred, Marlo Thomas, Wanda
          Sykes, LeRoy Neiman, Blair Underwood, Jon Gruden, Leon Uris, Celia
          Cruz, Bill Blass, and Dr. Andrew Weil, to name a few. He orchestrated
          the first U.S. publicity book tour for Ingrid Betancourt and her book,
          Until Death Do Us Part , prior to her abduction by FARC kidnappers in
          the jungles of Colombia. In 2006, Loeber launched Mouth Public
          Relations, a boutique PR firm in New York City that collectively
          represents celebrities, authors (including more than 23 New York Times
          Best-Sellers), and a wide range of categories including
          consumer/lifestyle, non-profit, health and wellness, food,
          entertainment, events and crisis management. At Mouth, Justin and his
          team of four have had the honor of representing many passionate
          personalities and brands, such as Mitch Albom, Jen Sincero, and
          Snooki; musical icons Peter, Paul and Mary, Kenny Loggins, Neil
          Sedaka, Carly Simon, and Judy Collins; ESPN commentators Digger
          Phelps, Linda Cohn, and Kenny Mayne; the School of Visual Arts’ 21st,
          22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th and 28th Annual Dusty Film &amp;
          Animation Festival and Awards; and, as the PR Agency of Record for
          Globe Pequot Press, Running Press Publishers, GMC Publications, LTD,
          and Mango Media. Loeber is proud to have been part of the team that
          launched wellness expert and cancer survivor Kris Carr’s career as a
          New York Times best-selling author, handling the media relations for
          Crazy Sexy Cancer, Crazy Sexy Cancer Survivor, Crazy Sexy Diet and
          Crazy Sexy Kitchen ; helped to expand the success of The Elf on the
          Shelf brand, from books to animation specials and even the balloon in
          the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade; and promoted key health and
          wellness programs at The Kripalu Center for Yoga &amp; Health, the
          largest retreat center in North America. He was also instrumental in
          brokering book deals for many, including John Leguizamo’s Pimps, Hos,
          Playa Hatas, and All the Rest of My Hollywood Friends (Ecco) and Kenny
          Loggins’ Footloose (Quarto). Prior to his career as a corporate
          publicist, Loeber slung hash, hosted, promoted and managed
          restaurants?most notably as a host at Tavern on the Green (where he
          turned away Dolly Parton and Rock Hudson because the place was
          packed?OUCH!) and Triplets Romanian Steakhouse (where he managed 35
          kitchen and wait staff members and coordinated, directed and
          choreographed dinner, dancing and shows). In the 1980s he was a solo
          pop recording artist in the United Kingdom, where he was discovered by
          and toured with English music legend Gary Numan, who signed Loeber as
          the first solo artist on his record label Numa. Loeber had three
          additional recording contracts here in the states; on weekends, he
          tooled NYC in a disco limo with the likes of Marc Anthony and Taylor
          Dayne?all of whom performed from club-to-club to promote their latest
          singles. Loeber’s music career voluntarily ended after he sang his
          last note in conjunction with gun shots in a NYC club. (“What it
          because I sang a wrong note?”) To de-stress, Loeber buys, orchestrates
          demolitions, renovates, designs and sells properties in Manhattan,
          Brooklyn, Connecticut, Philadelphia and Woodstock, New York?one of
          which was featured in the New York Times Real Estate section. Loeber
          lives with his Dachshund, Rufus, in New York City and Weston, CT.Kris
