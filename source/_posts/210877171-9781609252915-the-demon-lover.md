            >A secretary finds herself psychically bound to her boss in this
            supernatural thriller from one of the leading luminaries of
            twenieth-century esoteric thought.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>The Demon Lover</i> was first published in 1927, the
          same year as H.P. Lovecraft’s <i>The Call of Cthulhu</i>. Dion Fortune
          was among a generation of occult horror writers that formed popular
          culture’s obsession with secret societies, vampires, demons, ritual
          magic, and dark powers lurking in the shadows. What sets Fortune apart
          from so many of her contemporaries is her deep knowledge of the inner
          workings of magical orders, rites, and practices, and her own
          freethinking on occult subjects, demonstrated in the classic
          <i>Psychic Self-Defense</i> and
          <i>The Mystical Qabalah</i>.<br /><br />When young Veronica Mainwaring
          is hired by Justin Lucas as his secretary, she has no idea that she
          will soon find herself being used as his own personal trance medium.
          With an invisible collar keeping her bound to Lucas, her every attempt
          at escape is foiled by a yank on the unseen chain. Veronica soon finds
          herself trapped in Lucas’ quest for power and knowledge beyond the
          earthly plane as a story of past lives, hidden evils, and a twisted
          love affair come to life in this occult thriller.<br /><br />“A
          convincingly unsettling book. Fortune evokes a world of powers that
          can threaten you; that are both part of a coherent moral mythology,
          and also cloaked in mystery. Things are unpredictable, though there is
          an order to them&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s not a book for every taste,
          maybe. But it’s worth a look, for a distinctive handling of magic and
          its overlap with the everyday world.” —<i>Black Gate</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dion Fortune (1891-1946), founder of The Society of the Inner Light,
          is recognized as one of the most luminous figures of 20th-century
          esoteric thought. A prolific writer, pioneer psychologist, powerful
          psychic, and spiritualist, she dedicated her life to the revival of
          the Western Mystery Tradition. She was also a member of the Order of
          the Golden Dawn, whose members included at various times such people
          as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and W.B. Yeats.Diana L. Paxson has
          been teaching classes and leading rituals on trance work for more than
          twenty years. She is the co-author, along with Marion Zimmer Bradley,
          of Priestess of Avalon and has continued the immensely popular Mists
          of Avalon series on her own.
