          <b><i>The New York Times</i> bestseller, revised and updated<br /></b
          ><br />This beloved guide, revised and updated with up-to-the minute
          scientific and spiritual insight, teaches readers how to listen to
          their bodies and assess all areas of their lives--relational,
          psychological, creative, environmental, professional--to understand
          what they need for health.<br />&nbsp;<br />When Mind Over Medicine
          was first published, it broke new ground in the fertile region where
          science and spirituality intersect. Through the process of restoring
          her own health, Dr. Lissa Rankin discovered that the conventional
          health care she had been taught to practice was missing something
          crucial: a recognition of the body's innate ability to self-repair and
          an appreciation for how we can control these self-healing mechanisms
          with the power of our own consciousness.<br />To better understand
          this phenomenon, she explored peer-reviewed medical literature and
          found evidence that the medical establishment had been proving that
          the body can heal itself for over 50 years. She shared her findings
          and laid out a practical plan for readers to heal themselves in this
          profoundly wise book--a New York Times bestseller and now a classic
          guide for people who are on a healing journey from illness, injury, or
          trauma.<br /><br />In the years since then, Dr. Rankin has deepened
          her exploration of the world's healing tradition and her understanding
          of the healing power we hold within ourselves--if only we can tap into
          it. This revised edition of Mind Over Medicine reflects her latest
          research, evolving wisdom, and work with clients and students in her
          healing community, as well as with doctors and other healers in her
          Whole Health Medicine Institute.<br /><br />Inside, readers will
          discover:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;A thorough update of Dr.
          Rankin's signature Six Steps to Healing Yourself&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;New
          insight into how unresolved trauma can stand in the way of healing
          from chronic and life-threatening illnesses-and powerful tools we can
          use to heal it&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;How to tune
          in to our Inner Pilot Light for intuitive guidance in our
          healing&nbsp;<br /><br />And much more<br /><br />"The healing that is
          possible may be right here," Dr. Rankin writes, "closer than close,
          underneath all your efforting and striving, available if you are ready
          to humble yourself before this possibility and receive what awaits
          you."
