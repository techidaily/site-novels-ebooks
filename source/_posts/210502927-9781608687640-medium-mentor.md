          “After reading MaryAnn’s Medium Mentor, I feel an undeniable
          connection to my lost loved ones.”<br />
          <strong
            >— Maria Menounos, host of Better Together with Maria Menounos and
            New York Times bestselling author of The EveryGirl’s Guide to
            Life<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “This is the book I needed to read at exactly this moment in time, and
          I had no idea I needed to read it. As my own intuitive abilities are
          increasing, and I am ready to shed the skin of people-pleaser and step
          more into my authentic power and truth, MaryAnn DiMarco provides me
          with the tools and practices I need to do both. Not only for psychics
          and mediums, this is a powerful self-help book and guide to bring us
          closer to our true nature — spiritual beings having a human
          experience.”<br />

          “MaryAnn will help you awaken your inner guide and unlock the power
          and strength of your intuition. Her work is life-changing!”<br />

          “This book is a true gem — and one I wish I’d had when starting out on
          my spiritual journey! Acting as a mentor and guide, MaryAnn DiMarco
          unpacks it all in her refreshingly honest, down-to-earth, and
          conversational style, helping us navigate the path to unlocking our
          psychic gifts and intuitive guidance.”<br />
          <strong
            >— Rebecca Rosen, spiritual medium and author of Spirited<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “MaryAnn is the most gifted psychic and intuitive I know, and she has
          played a huge role in my own psychic awakening journey. She has been a
          mentor and guide for many of the biggest milestones in my life and
          always shares the most loving, profound, and accurate guidance. One of
          the best things about MaryAnn is that she is both down-to-earth and
          deeply tuned in to realms beyond, so her wisdom and guidance resonate
          far and wide. There is a reason I call her my spiritual mama! This
          book is full of powerful techniques that will no doubt change your
          life and tune you back in to your heart and soul. If you are looking
          to expand your mind and spirit, and most of all to connect to realms
          beyond (and ancestors and loved ones! It’s so fun!), this book is for
          you. I can’t wait for you to learn from MaryAnn as I have been so
          blessed to!”<br />

          “Allow the words on these pages to crack you open to your greatest
          source of power, inner wisdom, and intuitive guidance. Take a deep
          breath, and know that you’re no longer alone on this journey. You now
