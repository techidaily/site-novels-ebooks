          • Explores how we naturally project consciousness onto machines and
          how this is reflected in human culture, science, artificial
          intelligence, and literature <br /><br />• Demonstrates a direct
          connection between consciousness and the history of machines in
          American history <br /><br />• Looks at the contributions and
          influence of Grace Hopper, Richard Feynman, Philip K. Dick, Nikola
          Tesla, Thomas Edison, Elon Musk, David Bohm, Norbert Wiener, and Steve
          Jobs as well as the Nag Hammadi Gnostic gospels <br /><br />Humans
          invented and constructed machines to aid them, as far back as the
          Stone Age. As the machines became more complex, they became extensions
          of the body and mind, and we naturally began projecting consciousness
          onto them. As Luke Lafitte shows in detail, although machines
          complicate the already complicated issue of identity, because they are
          “ours” and “of us,” they are part of our spiritual development.
          <br /><br />In this sweeping exploration of the history of the machine
          as a tool, as a transpersonal object to assist human activity, and as
          a transitional artifact between spirits and the humans who interact
          with them, Lafitte examines the role that machines play in the
          struggle between “spiritual man” and “mechanical man” throughout
          history. He interprets the messages, archetypes, and language of the
          unconscious in the first popular stories related to mechanical men,
          and he demonstrates a direct connection between consciousness and the
          history of machines in American history, specifically between the
          inventors of these machines and the awakening of our imaginations and
          our powers of manifestation. He examines the influence of Philip K.
          Dick, Nikola Tesla, Thomas Edison, Grace Hopper, Richard Feynman, Elon
          Musk, David Bohm, and others and shows how the Nag Hammadi gospels
          explain how we can take back our myth and spirit from the machine.
          <br /><br />Although the term “mechanical man” is a catch-all phrase,
          Lafitte shows that the term is also a meeting ground where
          extra-dimensional communications between different forms of matter
          occur. Every machine, android, robot, and cyborg arose from
          consciousness, and these mechanical men, whether real or fictive,
          offer us an opportunity to free ourselves from enslavement to
          materialism and awaken our imaginations to create our own realities.

          "The ambition of Lafitte’s
          <i>Machine Intelligence and the Imaginal Realm</i> is massive,
          provocative, and essential. It is a book that traces the emergence of
          the American character and mythos reflected in the form of the
          ever-evolving mechanical man. From the steam engine and the Tin Man in
          the Wizard of Oz to the Darth Vader and the Matrix, the book is a
          whirlwind blending of scholarship and pop culture portraying a vortex
          of ideas, influences, and expressions that portend an epochal shift in
          how we live, perceive reality, spirituality, and self. We are immersed
          in a wide array of challenges, complexity, and opportunities, and
          Lafitte is our navigator."
