            ><i>October 1988</i>: Bob Cranmer buys a house in the Pittsburgh
            suburb he grew up in. He has no idea that his dream home is about to
            become his worst nightmare…</b
          ><br /><br />The Cranmers seemed fated to own the house at 3406
          Brownsville Road. As a young boy, Bob had been drawn to the property,
          and, just when the family decided to move back to Brentwood, it went
          up for sale. Without a second thought, they purchased the house that
          Bob had always dreamed of owning.<br /><br />But soon, the family
          began experiencing strange phenomena—objects moving on their own,
          ghostly footsteps, unsettling moaning sounds—that gradually increased
          in violence, escalating to physical assaults and, most disturbingly,
          bleeding walls. Bob, Lesa, and their four children were under attack
          from a malicious demon that was conjuring up terrifying manifestations
          to destroy their tight-knit household. They had two choices: leave or
          draw on their unwavering faith to exorcise the malicious fiend who
          haunted their home.<br /><br />Now, Bob Cranmer recounts the harrowing
          true story of the evil presence that tormented his family and the epic
          spiritual war he fought to save everything he held dear…<br /><br /><b
