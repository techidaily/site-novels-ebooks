          <p>
            I lived with DID or, as most people call it, split personalities. I
            lived this way most of my life. There are thousands of people that
            live this way, but just like me, they are afraid people would look
            down on them or make fun of them once they were diagnosed. They,
            like me, will not understand what a very hard life it is to live
            this kind of life. I am not only writing for the people that suffer
            from DID, but I'm writing it for the families that live with this
            horrible condition, and so maybe they can love and understand
            unconditionally.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Hopefully, people with DID can find a Christian counselor so they
            will understand more of what they are going through and get help.
            Everyone that has DID had some kind of trauma in their early life,
            and God gave us a way to handle what happened to us through our
            other personalities. I pray that by the end of my book, people will
            feel hope and love again, even against those that hurt them. My
            prayer is that this book reaches hundreds of people and their
            families while they do the very hard work it takes to get healed.
            And trust me, one can get healed because I did through our Lord
            Jesus Christ. God bless you all, and my heart truly goes out to you
            all! I have to thank God first for my amazing healing, but I have to
            thank all my amazing counselors for never giving up on me: Terry,
            Sue, and Dawn. And of course, my amazing husband, Robert, whom the
            Lord sent to me. I love you all dearly!
