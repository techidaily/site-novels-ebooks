          inspiration and understanding here that in some way contributes to
          their own inner peace.” —The Dalai Lama

          His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, was born in
          1935 to a peasant family in northeastern Tibet and was recognized at
          the age of two as the reincarnation of his predecessor, the Thirteenth
          Dalai Lama. The world's foremost Buddhist leader, he travels
          extensively, speaking eloquently in favor of ecumenical understanding,
          kindness and compassion, respect for the environment, and, above all,
          world peace.
