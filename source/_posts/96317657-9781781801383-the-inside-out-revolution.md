          ><br /><br />In this groundbreaking new book, bestselling author
          Michael Neill shares an extraordinary new understanding of how life
          works that turns traditional psychology on its head. This
          revolutionary approach is built around three simple principles that
          explain where our feelings come from and how our experience of life
          can transform for the better in a matter of moments. <br /><br />
          Understanding these principles allows you to tap into the deeper
          intelligence behind life, access your natural wisdom and guidance, and
          unleash your limitless creative power. You'll be able to live with
          less stress, greater ease, and a sense of connection to the larger
          unfolding of life. <br /><br /><i
            >Welcome to the space where miracles happenâ€¦ Are you ready to
            begin?</i
