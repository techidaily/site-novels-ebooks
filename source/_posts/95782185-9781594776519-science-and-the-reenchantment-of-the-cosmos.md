          Presents a revolutionary new theory that bridges the divide between
          science and spirituality<br /><br />• Discloses the ramifications of
          non-localized consciousness and how the physical world and spiritual
          experience are two aspects of the same reality<br /><br />• Includes
          contributions from Jane Goodall, Ed Mitchell, Stanislav Grof, Ralph
          Abraham, and Christian de Quincy, among others<br /><br />What
          scientists are now finding at the outermost frontiers of every field
          is overturning all the basic premises concerning the nature of matter
          and reality. The universe is not a world of separate things and events
          but is a cosmos that is connected, coherent, and bears a profound
          resemblance to the visions held in the earliest spiritual traditions
          in which the physical world and spiritual experience were both aspects
          of the same reality and man and the universe were one. The findings
          that justify this new vision of the underlying logic of the universe
          come from almost all of the empirical sciences: physics, cosmology,
          the life sciences, and consciousness research. They explain how
          interactions lead to interconnections that produce instantaneous and
          multifaceted coherence--what happens to one part also happens to the
          other parts, and hence to the system as a whole. The sense of sacred
          oneness experienced by our ancestors that was displaced by the
          unyielding material presumptions of modern science can be restored,
          and humanity can once again feel at home in the universe.
