            >New in paperback (originally published as <i>Human by Design</i>):
            At the cutting edge of science and spirituality,
            <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Gregg Braden explains that
            evolution is not the whole story of humanity--and offers a new
            understanding of our origins that can help us tap the extraordinary
            abilities we already have.</b
          ><br /><br />What would it mean to discover we're designed to live
          extraordinary lives of self-healing, longevity, and deep intuition? Is
          it possible that the advanced awareness achieved by monks, nuns, and
          mystics--considered rare in the past--is actually meant to be a normal
          part of our daily lives? <br /><br />In this revelatory book, now
          available for the first time in paperback, five-time
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and 2018 Templeton Award
          nominee Gregg Braden explains that we no longer need to ask these
          questions as "What if?" Recent discoveries ranging from human
          evolution and genetics to the new science of neuro-cardiology (the
          bridge between the brain and the heart) have overturned 150 years of
          thinking when it comes to the way we think of ourselves, our origin,
          and our capabilities.<br /><br />
          In this reader-friendly journey of discovery, Braden begins with the
          fact that we exist as we do, even more empowered, and more connected
          with ourselves and the world than scientists have believed in the
          past. It's this undisputable fact that leads to even deeper mysteries.
          "How do we awaken the extraordinary abilities that come from such an
          awesome connection?" "What role does our ancient and mysterious
          heritage play in our lives today?" <br /><br />Join Gregg as he
          crosses the traditional boundaries of science and spirituality to
          answer precisely these questions. In doing so he reveals a) specific
          tools, techniques, and practices to awaken our deep intuition
          on-demand, for self healing and longevity; and 2) concrete solutions
          to the social issues that are destroying our families and dividing us
          as people, including the bullying of young people, hate crimes, the
          growing epidemic of suicide, religious extremism, and more.<br /><br />When
          new discoveries prove that the existing human story is no longer based
          in fact, it's time to change the story. This simple truth is at the
          heart of the book you're about to read.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Five-time New York Times best-selling author and scientist Gregg
          Braden is internationally renowned as a pioneer in bridging science,
          spirituality, and the real world! Following a successful career as a
          Computer Geologist during the 1970s energy crisis, he worked in the

          1991 he became the First Technical Operations Manager for Cisco
          Systems. Since 1986 Gregg has explored high mountain villages, remote
          monasteries, and forgotten texts to merge their timeless secrets with
          the best science of today. The author of 11 award-winning books, now
          published in 38 languages, Gregg has received numerous honors,
          including a 2018 nomination for the prestigious Templeton Award. He
          has shared his presentations with the United Nations, Fortune 500
          companies, and the U.S. military, as well as in media specials aired
          throughout the world.
