          Almost since the dawn of time, the image of the Green Man—the carven
          enigmatic head surrounded by leaves and foliage—has both intrigued and
          mystified viewers and folklorists alike. Appearing in churches,
          taverns, and even on stately buildings, the carving seems shrouded in
          supernatural obscurity. Is it merely a fertility symbol, or is it
          something much deeper, which calls for a response from us all? Though
          it seems a predominantly Celtic icon, does the concept of the Green
          Man also appear in other places and in other cultures? What is its
          relevance for the world today? In an absorbing new book, Dr. Bob
          Curran traces the many strands that make up this enigmatic image.
          Tracing its origins from prehistoric times, he explores its
          significance in the medieval world and discusses its development in
          the modern world. He also investigates the image’s psychological
          appeal, which has allowed it to continue down through the ages, and,
          pulling from a variety of sources, its impact upon other cultures in
          various parts of the world. From heroic archetypes such as Robin Hood
          to Demigods such as Herne the Hunter; from the King of the Woods to
          the Jack in the Green, Walking With the Green Man examines the
          interconnection of man and Nature throughout history. Whether as a man
          amongst the trees, a man of the trees, or a symbol of Nature used to
          express secrets and solidarity, the Green Man’s visage is traced
          throughout lands and cultures. Walking With the Green Man will appeal
          to all those who are interested in the image of the Green Man as an
          example of symbolic art, as well as to those who are interested in
          folklore and the interplay between folklore and culture. It is a
          fascinating study, which not only examines the history of the icon but
          also its development within human perception.
