          When Jonathan Talat Phillips experiences a devastating loss as a
          countercultural media activist, he unwittingly starts on a mystical
          journey marked by underground ayahuasca ceremonies, kundalini
          awakenings, prankster spirit guides, extraterrestrial encounters at
          the Burning Man festival, and miraculous energy healings that reshape
          his skeptical worldview. Along the way, he chronicles the rise of an
          international movement that is trailblazing visionary ways to address
          our current planetary crisis through raised consciousness.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          To better understand his spiritual journey, Jonathan delves into his
          own Christian background, discovering the lost rites of the mystery
          schools. Uncovering secret “electric” meanings behind biblical symbols
          like the serpent, dove, and tree of life, he reveals how early
          Christians utilized a radical initiation process for harnessing divine
          energy in order to achieve gnosis, direct knowledge or experience of
          the divine. Jonathan suggests that these mystical symbols, which
          appear in spiritual traditions across the globe, offer a profound
          energetic roadmap and alchemical message for personal transformation,
          as well as a potential evolutionary shift for our world.<br /><br /><b

          “A modern <i>Odyssey </i>of awakening, Jonathan Talat Phillips's
          journey into Gnosticism deeply resonates with the eccentric moment.
          <i>The Electric Jesus</i>, a spiritual autobiography, reveals a life
          lived in the light of transformation, searching for the mystic core of
          a planetary civilization.”

          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          "A fresh, vigorous, and often startling account of a man's
          introduction to higher planes of reality. If you've ever wondered what
          the new consciousness movement is about, read this book and find out."

          “Entertaining, celebratory, burning, reflective, and electric—but
          definitely not for the faint of heart or hard of head. With tales of
          sex, drugs, elves and Jesus, this memoir romps through the hinterlands
          of body and soul.”

          "Every cultural scene needs good personal narratives. Jonathan Talat
          Phillips' <i>Electric Jesus</i> raises a proud flag for the
          post-modern Burning Man and techno psychonautic era. However, Phillips
          also seeks for more than just a flashy escape hatch from the burdens
          of a materialistic or pop-cultural corporate worldview.
          <i>The Electric Jesus </i>is about the quest for true Gnosis as much
          as it is about the crazy costumes we wear along the way. This book is
          sure to be one of those that defines the psychedelic resurgence that
          has been recently constellated by Reality Sandwich and the Evolver
          Social Movement." <b>—Adam Elenbaas, author of </b

          "Jonathan Talat Phillips discovers Gnosis, transforms himself, goes

          “In this vividly written and deeply personal memoir, Jonathan Talat
          Phillips, cofounder of the Evolver Social Movement, travels through
          the key stops on the current countercultural railroad—Burning Man,
          ayahuasca sessions, kundalini awakenings, MDMA—and winds up in
          unexpected places, thoroughly off the tracks, seeking planetary
          transformation on a new scale—a classic heroic journey, bringing out
          of his own darkest places a gift not for himself but for his people.

          ><br /><br />"Hats off to the author, Jonathan Talat Phillips, who
          takes some risks in this ballsy, thoughtful, and searingly honest tale
          of soul awakening. Spurred to activism in the wake of 9-11, and left
          depressed and angry after the elections of 2004, Phillips begins
          searching for answers and change. His starting point becomes the
          ancient Gnostic texts, and the unfiltered and mystical Jesus he finds
          portrayed therein. The author's research into the mystery schools, the
          clues he uncovers in the actual language of the Bible and apocryphal
          texts, and the archetypal symbols he investigates are fascinating and
          powerful." <br /><b>—Cheryl Shainmark, <i>Merlian News</i></b
