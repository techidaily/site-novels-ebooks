            Beverley Buckley did not realise that information she accessed
            during a meditation session held on a rainy Saturday afternoon in
            Sydney early in the 1990's would transform her life and the lives of
            hundreds of others. Following the meditation, she wrote that her
            higher purpose was "to access information that would allow people to
            remember and understand that they have the power to heal themselves
            and to be whatever they choose to be". Understandably, she was
            skeptical that the information she had accessed had any basis in
            reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            A decade later, Beverley understood the process by which people
            could heal themselves but it took much longer to convince herself
            that what she had discovered wasn't just something she was
            imagining. She called the process Stress Defusion and it facilitated
            bringing information held in people's sub-conscious minds to
            conscious awareness. In many cases, it meant encouraging people to
            face their deepest fears.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Without medical training Beverley needed to understand the process
            she was working with. Without understanding she could not explain
            it. This required years of research to identify information from
            mainstream scientific research that supported what she was seeing.
            It involved assembling information accessed by hundreds of people in
            order to identify and understand the patterns of peoples' lives and
            indeed, the patterns of humanity as a whole... and it involved
            seeing what happened over time when people who worked with the
            Stress Defusion process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything in Its Place tells the story of people who sought help to
            heal their lives. It explains how they created their lives to be the
            way they were - and what they needed to do to change the things in
            their lives that they didn't like.

          "Everything in its Place" is a document of personal and exter- nal
          achievement. &nbsp;It is an interesting blend of plain English
          explanation of hard science, personal anecdotes, experimentation and
          spiritual information. &nbsp;It is a remarkably appealing and
          inspirational document. - David Sands

          Highly informative insight into the mysteries of the self-heal- ing
          powers of the mind. A personal, intuitive, and enlightening account of
          dealing with various mental health issues. - Vivian Waring (author

          Through the development of a technique that allows individu- als to
          easily access the contents of their subconscious minds and identify
          negative programmes they have created for them- selves, &nbsp;Beverley
          &nbsp;has &nbsp;identified &nbsp;something &nbsp;very &nbsp;important.
          Demonstrating over and over again with case studies that provide
          compelling reading, she describes changes that occur when people
          identify and address the negative programmes they have created for
          themselves as children. The strategy she describes has been shown to
          transform peoples' experi- ence of life from academic misfit, sporting
          incompetent &nbsp;and social outcast to encompass academic excellence,
          adoption of leadership roles and positive relationships with
          themselves and their peers. &nbsp;Fascinating reading, her work
          provides the basis for further investigation.

          "Everything in its Place" is well presented and insightful leaving the
          reader with many considerations with regard to where we are and where
          we could be headed. &nbsp;It balances both intellectual and esoteric
          themes with aplomb and is by far my most interesting read of the year.

          Beverley has written a very well researched guide to achieving a more
          positive life. &nbsp;Everything In It's Place is filled with real life
          stories of individuals who have been struggling to find their way, and
          have put the principles outlined in this book into practice in their
          own lives and have found help and answers. &nbsp;Common sense,
          listening, and the ability to get to the heart of the matter, have
          helped many people who have come into contact with Beverley and
          reading this well written book may give you some answers too. &nbsp;
          Definitely worth reading and can only help the reader seeking more
          clarity in life;''- Alison Lewis, author of Missing and Seasons of
          Life
