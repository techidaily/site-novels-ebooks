          A practical guide to using the sacred herbs of Samhain for healing,
          divination, purification, protection, magic, and as tools for
          contacting the Spirits <br /><br />• Explores the identification,
          harvest, and safe practical and ritual use of more than 70 plants and
          trees sacred to the Celtic festival of Samhain, the origin of
          Halloween <br /><br />• Details the most effective plants for
          protection from the mischief of Fairies, herbs for releasing the Dead,
          and visionary plants for divination and shamanic work <br /><br />•
          Provides instructions and suggestions for a traditional Dumb Supper,
          offerings to the Land Spirits, Samhain rites, and recipes for the
          sacred foods of Samhain <br /><br />The ancient Celts separated the
          year into two halves, the light half and the dark half, summer and
          winter. The festival of Samhain, from which the modern holiday of
          Halloween originates, marks the transition from summer to winter, the
          end of the Celtic year, a time when the barriers between the physical
          and spiritual world are at their most transparent. The herbs most
          characteristic of this time have specific magical and healing
          properties that echo the darker aspect of the year and offer potent
          opportunities for divination, contact with ancestors and Land Spirits,
          and journeys in the Otherworld. <br /><br />Presenting a practical
          guide to the sacred herbs and trees of Samhain, Ellen Evert Hopman
          details the identification, harvest, and use of more than 70 plants
          and trees in healing, divination, purification, magic, and as tools
          for contacting the Spirits wandering the landscape at this liminal
          time of year. She explores the most effective plants for protection
          from the mischief of the “Good Neighbors,” the Sidhe or Fairies, as
          well as herbs for releasing the Dead when they are trapped on this
          plane. Identifying visionary plants used to induce ecstatic trance,
          Hopman explores how herbs have been used for millennia to aid in
          psychic travel and shamanic work and shows how one might safely use
          plants to take a voyage to the Otherworld. Drawing on her knowledge as
          a master herbalist, she also includes cautions to prevent harm and
          misidentification, along with advice on basic etiquette and common
          sense approaches to herb magic. <br /><br />Detailing the history,
          rites, and traditions of Samhain, Hopman explains how to make an
          offering to the Land Spirits and provides instructions for the
          traditional Samhain ritual of the Dumb Supper, complete with recipes
          for the sacred foods of Samhain, such as Soul Cakes, Colcannon, Boxty
          bread, and dandelion wine. Woven throughout with mystical tales of
          folk, Fairy, and sacred herbs, this guide offers each of us practical
          and magical ways to connect with Nature, the plant kingdom, the
          Spirits that surround us, and the turning of the year.

          "Ellen Evert Hopman, a prolific author of herbal manuals and handbooks
          is a long-time herbalist who cares deeply about your use of herbs. You
          can sense that easily because her handbook [
          <i>The Sacred Herbs of Samhain</i>] is like a kit, containing lots of
          information and stories doled out in a practical way. One thing seems
          clear: herbs are our allies. Herbs guide us towards physical and
          mental health and the health of the planet, if we respect and use them
          right."
