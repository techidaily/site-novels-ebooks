              >When I was going to the University of Ife in 1976,1 made one
              resolution - to hide myself in the crowd and get lost in the
              world. I did not want anything about 'God' around me.
              Consequently, I threw away my small Bible and everything that
              reminded me of God. Sincerely speaking, I could not say why I took
              that decision.</strong

              >I was born into the Anglican Church and the rest of my brothers
              and sisters were godly. In my secondary school days, I had joined
              the 'Born Again' group, and thought I loved God. But soon, all of
              that stopped, as I slipped back into the world. Somehow, it seemed
              there was something in me that did not want God really. While at
              home, I had to do 'church things' once in a while, somehow under
              pressure - just to satisfy my family expectations. Now, I was
              happy to be on my way to the 'campus' where no one would bother me
              about God. My going to the University was therefore seen as an
              escape from God and I kept to it.</strong

              >All through my campus days, the National Service and up to 1983
              when I started work with the Union Bank, I kept to my decision to
              keep God away from me. Somehow, I felt that the ways of God were
              too tough, and His standards too high for me. I therefore wanted
              to 'enjoy' myself and forget about 'Heaven and hell,' I
              thought.</strong

              >I went to church again in 1987 just because I was getting
              married. Soon after the wedding, I decided to quit going to church
              completely and I told my wife so. All her tears and pleas could
              not change my heart and at last she gave up. Soon after our
              wedding, on 20th April, 1987,1 stopped going to Church completely.
              I would not even go once in a while. I never saw the four walls of
              any church. On Sundays therefore my wife and the rest of the
              family would simply inform me that they were going to the church
              so that I might come and lock the door! That was the situation
              until May 28th, 1989, when something marvellous happened which
              changed the life of everyone in the family starting with me! You
              will get the details later.</strong

              >I therefore thank God for this wonderful privilege of being part
              of what is now a worldwide event, to usher in the ultimate rule of
              God here on earth. The Kingdom of God is about to be revealed to
              the earth. God is about to answer that popular age­ long prayer
              which Jesus taught at His disciples' request - "Thy Kingdom come,
              Thy will be done on earth... as it is done in Heaven..."</strong

              >God's political time-table is rapidly unfolding and His Ministers
              - the Angels - are at red-alert. They have indeed gone all out on
              "mission possible" - to prepare for the "landing" of the new
              Kingdom. Things have begun to happen. Unbelievable things are
              happening here again. They happened during the Apostolic Age -
              with the Apostles of the Lord. That was in the beginning of the
              Church Age. Here they are again - at the end of the Church Age.
              God is here again to reveal Himself to His people!</strong

              what I cannot understand! Why should I have expected God's grace
              to be so freely poured out on me, in such a way that all yokes are
              broken! I was not seeking Him. I was not involved in things about
              Him.</strong
