              >A fully updated 2-in-1 edition, with a new introduction by the
              author, combining Dr. Jim B. Tucker's bestselling books about
              children who remember past lives—<i>Return to Life</i> and
              <i>Life Before Life.</i></b
            ><br /><br />
            These two books contain first-person accounts of Jim B. Tucker's
            experiences with a number of extraordinary children with memories of
            past lives, and expands on the international work started by
            Tucker's University of Virginia colleague Ian Stevenson.<br /><br />
            Tucker's work has been lauded by the likes of parapsychologist Carol
            Bowman and Deepak Chopra, and has been described by some as quantum
            physics. His goal in each case of a child reporting memories of
            previous lives is to determine what happened—what the child has
            said, how the parents have reacted, whether the child's statements
            match the life of a particular deceased person, and whether the
            child could have learned such information through normal means.
            Tucker has found case studies that provide persuasive evidence that
            some children do, in fact, possess memories of previous lives.<br /><br />
            Thought-provoking and captivating, the stories in <i>Before</i> urge
            readers, skeptics and supporters alike to think about life, death,
            and reincarnation and to reflect about their own consciousness and
            spirituality.

          “In this very elegant book, Dr. Tucker offers the most convincing
          scientific evidence for the fact that our consciousness survives
          physical death. And indeed, takes quantum leaps of creativity in the
          form of reincarnation. The model that Dr. Tucker presents opens a new
          vision of who we are, limitless beings that fill up all of space and
          time.” —<i
            >Deepak Chopra, author of Life After Death: The Burden of Proof</i
          ><br /><br />“[A][ solid case for reincarnation…. Tucker introduces
          powerful grounds for credulous speculation.” —<i>Booklist</i
          ><br /><br />“Jim Tucker gives us a clear, concise and eminently
          rational insight into a 40 year investigation of what is
          unquestionably the best evidence for the existence of reincarnation.
          We are lucky to have in him a worthy successor to Ian Stevenson.” —<i
            >TOM SHRODER, author of Old Souls: Compelling Evidence From Children
            Who Remember Past Lives</i
          ><br /><br />“Anyone with an open mind, on reading Dr. Jim B.
          Tucker's<i> Life Before Life</i>, will realize that our conventional
          concepts of life and death are ripe for revision. The possibilities
          raised by this book for human destiny are as hopeful as the current
          view is grim. Life Before Life is extraordinarily important.” —<i
            >Larry Dossey, M.D., author of The Extraordinary Healing Power of
            Ordinary Things, Reinventing Medicine, and Healing Words</i
          ><br /><br />“With his training as a pediatric psychiatrist, and the
          mind of an inquiring scientist, Dr. Jim Tucker takes a fresh look at
          one of life's most intriguing questions: 'Does consciousness survive
          death?' Through the hundreds of case studies of his predecessor, Dr.
          Ian Stevenson, and his own cases, Dr. Tucker adds new insight to this
          amazing research, and draws us closer to understanding this perennial
          mystery.” —<i
            >CAROL BOWMAN, author of Children's Past Lives and Return From
            Heaven</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Life Before Life</i> adds to the increasingly
          impressive science of consciousness and the continuity of
          mind/memory…this book is the tip of an important iceberg that will
          continue to expand our knowledge of the spiritual reality of Life.”
          —C. NORMAN SHEALY, M.D., Ph.D., President, Holos University Graduate
          Seminary; Founding President, American Holistic Medical Association;
          author of Youthful Aging—Secret of the Fountain<br /><br />“Jim B.
          Tucker's fine presentation of Ian Stevenson's decades of rigorous
          scientific research into evidence of children's apparent past-life
          recollections expresses the true spirit of scientific skepticism,
          rather than the knee-jerk materialism that all too often waves that
          proud banner.” —<i
            >B. ALAN WALLACE, President of the Santa Barbara Institute for
            Consciousness Studies<br /><br
          /></i>
          “In <i>Return to Life</i>, Jim Tucker painstakingly and meticulously
          documents the recycling of memories from beyond the barrier of
          physical death. He then rigorously offers a scientific theory to
          explain how our consciousness transcends space/time and is, hence,
          eternal. This book is an important milestone of an emerging scientific
          paradigm that suggests that consciousness conceives governs constructs
          and becomes the universe or perhaps multiple universes.” —<i
            >Deepak Chopra</i
          ><br /><br />“A breezy page-turner...Tucker presents these
          cases...with professioanlism and palpable respect.” —<i
            >Spirituality and Health</i
          ><br /><br />“Jim Tucker is a worthy successor to Dr. Ian Stevenson.
          He approaches these fascinating cases of children who appear to
          remember previous lives with an intelligent curiosity, sober judgment,
          and a real knack for telling a story, which is a good thing, because
          these are great stories.” —<i
            >Tom Shroder, Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and author of Old
            Souls: Compelling Evidence from Children Who Remember Past Lives</i
          ><br /><br />“These incredible cases are not simply solid grounds for
          accepting some form of reincarnation into our Western worldview. These
          are heart-rending, poignant reminders that many of us do not quite
          'fit' into the cultural and religious worlds into which we are born.
          Obviously, we are more than these worlds. Way, way more.” —<i
            >Jeffrey J. Kripal, author of Authors of the Impossible: The Sacred
            and the Paranormal</i
          ><br /><br />“Researchers at the University of Virginia Medical
          School's Department of Perceptual Studies are studying reports from
          children around the world who claim to remember their past lives. More
          than 2,500 such reports have been analyzed by the Project's founder
          Ian Sevenson and several colleagues, among them Jim Tucker. Their work
          has immense implications for our understanding of the world and human
          nature, but has received relatively little attention from mainstream
          scientists and religious groups. <i>Return to Life</i>, like Dr.
          Tucker's previous book, <i>Life Before Life</i>, opens a door on this
          historic research. Even if you disagree with Tucker's brief
          speculations about the afterlife, you will get a good look at the kind
          of evidence for reincarnation that the University of Virginia team is
          assembling. It is astonishing to me that their work is not better
          known.” —<i
            >Michael Murphy, Founder and Chairman Emeritus, Esalen Institute,
            and co-author of God and the Evolving Universe</i
          ><br /><br />“With <i>Return to Life</i>, Dr. Jim B. Tucker has driven
          a very large nail in the coffin of materialism. This is an important
          contribution to the growing body of evidence that consciousness
          survives the death of the brain and body. The fear of death and
          annihilation has caused more suffering in human history than all the
          physical diseases combined. This book is a powerful antidote to that
          dread.” —<i
            >Larry Dossey, MD, author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is
            Part of a Great Consciousness and Why It Matters</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Return to Life </i>comes as a resounding wake-up call
          regarding human existence. For decades, materialists have insisted
          that consciousness is nothing more than a function or emergent
          property of the brain. But the fact is that scientifically, the
          origins and nature of consciousness and its role in nature remain a
          mystery. The greatest obstacle to illuminating these issues through
          scientific discovery is not ignorance, but the illusion that we
          already have the answers. The empirical evidence that Dr. Tucker
          presents in this book challenges the reductionistic, metaphysical
          beliefs of scientific materialism. If his research methods are flawed,
          the scientific community should bring this to his and the public's
          attention. If they are irreproachable, then the empirical facts he
          reveals compel us to reassess even our most fundamental assumptions
          about consciousness, human nature, and the universe at large.” —<i
