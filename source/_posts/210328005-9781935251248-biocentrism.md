          Robert Lanza is one of the most respected scientists in the world — a
          US News &amp; World Report cover story called him a “genius" and a
          “renegade thinker," even likening him to Einstein. Lanza has teamed
          with Bob Berman, the most widely read astronomer in the world, to
          produce Biocentrism, a revolutionary new view of the universe.<br /><br />Every
          now and then a simple yet radical idea shakes the very foundations of
          knowledge. The startling discovery that the world was not flat
          challenged and ultimately changed the way people perceived themselves
          and their relationship with the world. For most humans of the 15th
          century, the notion of Earth as ball of rock was nonsense. The whole
          of Western, natural philosophy is undergoing a sea change again,
          increasingly being forced upon us by the experimental findings of
          quantum theory, and at the same time, towards doubt and uncertainty in
          the physical explanations of the universe's genesis and structure.
          Biocentrism completes this shift in worldview, turning the planet
          upside down again with the revolutionary view that life creates the
          universe instead of the other way around.<br /><br />
          In this paradigm, life is not an accidental byproduct of the laws of
          physics. Biocetnrism takes the reader on a seemingly improbable but
          ultimately inescapable journey through a foreign universe—our own—from
          the viewpoints of an acclaimed biologist and a leading astronomer.
          Switching perspective from physics to biology unlocks the cages in
          which Western science has unwittingly managed to confine itself.
          Biocentrism will shatter the reader's ideas of life--time and space,
          and even death. At the same time it will release us from the dull
          worldview of life being merely the activity of an admixture of carbon
          and a few other elements; it suggests the exhilarating possibility
          that life is fundamentally immortal. <br /><br />The 21st century is
          predicted to be the Century of Biology, a shift from the previous
          century dominated by physics. It seems fitting, then, to begin the
          century by turning the universe outside-in and unifying the
          foundations of science with a simple idea discovered by one of the
          leading life-scientists of our age. Biocentrism awakens in readers a
          new sense of possibility, and is full of so many shocking new
          perspectives that the reader will never see reality the same way
          again.

          "I found the attack on physics to be pretty compelling ... Lanza's
          theories [are] certainly worth debate."<br /><b>
            <i>Houston Chronicle</i>'s Eric Berger, SciGuy blog</b
          >
          <br /><br />"What makes this book both interesting and worth the
          effort of reading it; is the unique perspective Lanza brings to the
          subject matter as a physician. ... From the way [Lanza] chooses to
          present his arguments, it's clear he has a solid grasp of esoteric
          disciplines like quantum theory, special relativity and particle
          physics. And what makes his presentation more compelling than other
          efforts I've encountered is his ability and willingness to weave
          personal experience into the thoughts and ideas presented. His style
          is conversational and warm which tends to pull you along through the
          exposition gently. And his sense of wonder and befuddlement at shop
          worn enigmas like the double slit experiment, Bell's theorem,
          non-locality and Schrödinger's cat is as infectious as it is
          delightful ... I very much like what Lanza has to say in
          <i>Biocentrism</i>."<br /><b> <i>Midwest Book Review</i> </b>
          <br /><br />

            >Endorsements for Robert Lanza's essay on which
            <i>Biocentrism</i> is based:</b
          >
          <br />"For several days now I have read and reread your article and
          thought about it. Like a brief history of time' it is indeed
          stimulating and brings biology into the whole. Any short statement
          does not do justice to such a scholarly work. Almost every society of
          mankind has explained the mystery of our surroundings and being by
          invoking a god or group of gods. Scientists work to acquire objective
          answers from the infinity of space or the inner machinery of the atom.
          Lanza proposes a biocentrist theory which ascribes the answer to the
          observer rather than the observed. The work is a scholarly
          consideration of science and philosophy that brings biology into the
          central role in unifying the whole. The book will appeal to an
          audience of many different disciplines because it is a new way of
          looking at the old problem of our existence. Most importantly, it
          makes you think."<br /><b>E. Donnall Thomas</b> <br />

            Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.</i
          >
          <br /><br />"It is genuinely an exciting piece of work. I am very
          familiar with some of the things you say. The idea that consciousness
          creates reality has quantum support, as you suggest, and also coheres
          with some of the things biology and neuroscience are telling us about
          the structures of our being. To put what you are doing in a larger
          context, it exhibits a dramatic new Copernican reversal. Just as we
          now know that the sun doesn't really move but we do (we are the active
          agents), so you are suggesting that we are the entities that give
          meaning to the particular configuration of all possible outcomes we
          call reality. I think this is a great project."<br /><b

          many fields from drug delivery to stem cells to preventing animal
          extinction, and clearly one of the most brilliant minds of our times,
          has done it again. A New Theory of the Universe' takes into account
          all the knowledge we have gained over the last few centuries, and
          correlates them to our own beings, placing in perspective our biologic
          limitations that have impeded our understanding of greater truths
          surrounding our existence and the universe around us. This new theory
          is certain to revolutionize our concepts of the laws of nature for
          centuries to come."<br /><b>Anthony Atala</b> <br />

          >
          <br /><br />"As an astrophysicist, I focus my attention on objects
          that are very large and very far away, ignoring the whole issue of
          consciousness as a critical part of the Universe. Reading Robert
          Lanza's work is a wake-up call to all of us that even on the grandest
          scale we still depend on our minds to experience reality. Issues of
          "quantum weirdness" do have a place in the macroscopic world. Time and
          space do depend on perception. We can go about our daily lives and
          continue to study the physical Universe as if it exists as an
          objective reality (because the probabilities allow that degree of
          confidence), but we do so with a better awareness of an underlying
          biological component, thanks to Dr. Lanza. I cannot speak for NASA or
          other NASA scientists, but personally I look forward to hearing a more
          detailed explanation of this biocentric view of the Universe from Dr.

          <br /><br />"Yes, it is appropriate to ask whether our perception of
          space and time is a consequence of our particular neurophysiology.
          Yes, it is appropriate to ask how it happened that the conditions
          worked out to be just right for life to appear somehow on earth and
          then to evolve from the archaea through the eukaryotes to us. ... I'll
          bet the book gets a good audience. And I like to see books published
          that challenge my own ideas and thoughts in ways that make me think,
          but not ones that simply throw dogma at me. The essay is definitely of
          the former kind."<br /><b>R. Stephen Berry</b> <br />

          <br /><br />"Science has a token of freedom that motivates scientists
          to study all logical possibilities that may explain the world. Robert
          Lanza has come up with an innovative approach to investigate reality
          from the viewpoint of biology. His article demands an answer to the
          question of whether scientists have exhausted all possible tools for
          studying nature. Can science bring biology into grand unified theory?
          A solution is suggested that involves a new concept, biocentrism.
          Lanza goes beyond the individual human attribute calling for
          interconnectedness among all living creatures forming the fundamental
          basis for understanding reality. A book that expands upon this unique
          approach is warranted, not only to alert society, but to call on it to
          test this novel new hypothesis."<br /><b>Gunther Kletetschka</b>

          >
          <br /><br />"It's a masterpiecetruly a magnificent essay. Bob Lanza is
          to be congratulated for a fresh and highly erudite look at the
          question of how perception and consciousness shape reality and common
          experience. His monograph combines a deep understanding and broad
          insight into 20th century physics and modern biological science; in so
          doing, he forces a reappraisal of this hoary epistemological dilemma.
          Not all will agree with the proposition he advances, but most will
          find his writing eminently readable and his arguments both convincing
          and challenging. Bravo."<br /><b>Michael Lysaght</b> <br />

          <b>Robert Lanza</b><br />"Robert Lanza was taken under the wing of
          scientific giants such as psychologist B.F. Skinner, immunologist
          Jonas Salk, and heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard. His
          mentors described him as a ‘genius,' a ‘renegade thinker,' even
          likening him to Einstein himself." —<i>US News &amp; World Report</i>
          cover story<br /><br />Robert Lanza has been exploring the frontiers
          of science for more than four decades, and is considered one of the
          leading scientists in the world. He is currently Chief Scientific
          Officer at Advanced Cell Technology, and Adjunct Professor at Wake
          Forest University School of Medicine. He has several hundred
          publications and inventions, and 20 scientific books, among them,
          <i>Principles of Tissue Engineering</i>, which is recognized as the
          definitive reference in the field. Others include
          <i

          <i>Handbook of Stem Cells and Essentials of Stem Cell Biology</i>,
          which are considered the definitive references in stem cell
          research.<br /><br />Dr. Lanza received his B.A. and M.D. degrees from
          the University of Pennsylvania, where he was both a University Scholar
          and Benjamin Franklin Scholar. He was also a Fulbright Scholar, and
          was part of the team that cloned the world's first human embryo, as
          well as the first to clone an endangered species, to demonstrate that
          nuclear transfer could reverse the aging process, and to generate stem
          cells using a method that does not require the destruction of human
          embryos. Dr. Lanza was awarded the 2005 Rave Award for Medicine by
          <i>Wired</i> magazine, and received the 2006 "All Star" Award for
          Biotechnology by Mass High Tech.<br /><br />Dr. Lanza and his research
          have been featured in almost every media outlet in the world,
          including all the major television networks, CNN,
          <i>Time, Newsweek, People</i> magazine, as well as the front pages of

          and <i>USA Today</i>, among others. Lanza has worked with some of the
          greatest thinkers of our time, including Nobel Laureates Gerald
          Edelman and Rodney Porter. Lanza worked closely with B.F. Skinner at
          Harvard University. Lanza and Skinner (the "Father of Modern
          Behaviorism") published a number of scientific papers together. He has
