            Jeff Woolwine<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a resident of Phoenix,
            Arizona, living near South Mountain. Since the spring of 2004, Jeff
            has experienced many UFO sightings and has video taped most of his
            experiences. Jeff, a native to Arizona, is a man on a mission, with
            the intent of trying to solve the ongoing mystery of the Phoenix
            Lights. In this interview will cover Jeff's background, his research
            efforts, his experiences with the media in Phoenix, his recent
            sightings, and what Jeff thinks is behind these repeated appearances
            of UFOs in the Phoenix area. From Jeff, "I have been watching the
            Phoenix Lights since June 2004. I have determined that not only are
            the lights here, but that they appear to be tracked by the
            government. I have done several TV News interviews with Phoenix TV
            stations talking about flares and the lights. I have also found
            evidence that people living in this are 1500 years ago saw the
            lights as well. There are drawings all over Phoenix's South Mountain
            that show the lights and the geo-magnetic lines that are associated
            with fault lines, which may be used by the UFOs to absorb energy to
            power themselves - sort of like a gas station for UFOs. I have
            studied UFOs for years. I am out to prove that they are here and
            have never left us. Thousands of years ago, people left
            hieroglyphics and petroglyphs and documents such as the Dead Sea
            Scrolls and parts of the Bible showing evidence of UFOs and ETs. It
            seems like every time UFOs show up, something happens to the Earth.
            In my opinion, things are going to change our way of life very soon,
            and that is why the UFOs are here more than ever - to watch before
            and after".<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>Jeff continues to capture
            videos of UFOs near South Mountain and is investigating the apparent
            connection between the UFOs he sees and the ancient petroglyphs that
            cover the rocks on South Mountain.&nbsp;
