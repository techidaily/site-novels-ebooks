            Blending material from social work with religious and spiritual
            sources, this book makes explicit that engaging with spirituality in
            its broadest sense is an essential aspect of socially just social
            work practice. Gardner connects shared understandings of
            spiritual/religious traditions, critically reflective social work,
            First Nations relational world views, green and relational
            approaches.

              Socially Just Approach</i
            >
            outlines the theoretical framework of critical spirituality, which
            is explored as a way of workers’ understanding their own and others’
            sense of meaning, whether it is spiritual and/or religious, and to
            encourage workers to be mindful, open, humble and energised as
            workers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combining the theoretical and practical, this book outlines
            strategies and processes to ensure social workers embed spirituality
            in their practice constructively and inclusively across all areas of
            practice. This book will be of interest to those engaged in the
            wider field of social work, from direct service to policy
            development.

          ‘While crisis and uncertainty are central to the experience of living
          in the 21st century, so too is the need for that which is restorative.
          This is Fiona Gardner’s starting point as she wrestles with the
          complexities of what it means to be a person for whom aspects of
          religion/spirituality are both central to one’s identity and sense of
          meaning but at the same time often regarded as deeply flawed and
          problematic. This is social work scholarship at its best as Gardner
          grapples with the essence of what it is to be human and what really
          matters to create an understanding of social work practice which
          weaves together a multiplicity of factors including religion and
          spirituality, ethics, histories, theories, cultural and environmental
          contexts, and most importantly, lived experiences.’<br /><b

          'I experienced a sense of enthusiasm for this book that I very rarely
          experience in seeing a new social work text. Fiona presents a deeply
          satisfying holistic and integrated synthesis of the most important
          aspects of being spiritual and being a social worker in a way which is
          accessible to people of all faiths, ideologies and world views. It is
          an extremely timely and necessary book given all that is happening on
          a global scale. We owe it to ourselves, not just as social workers,
          but as engaged human beings, to read and ponder its contents.'<br /><b

          'Fiona Gardner has provided a clear, concise, and persuasive argument
          for the need to include spirituality and religion in social work
          practice. She demonstrates the manner in which a commitment to
          decolonized social work requires an acknowledgment of what people
          value and hold dear in their lives, what gives them meaning, purpose,
          and the will to continue. She draws upon her own model of critical
          spirituality, as well as green, or eco, spirituality, and First
          Nation’s spirituality, to show how spirituality and religion raise
          questions related to the environment and social justice alongside
          personal meaning-making. Integrating critical reflection, and
          providing numerous case examples, she offers methods of incorporating
          a social worker’s humility and curiosity as the foundation for
          respecting spirituality in individual, family, and community
          practices, and within organizational contexts. Practically, she draws
          upon narrative and strengths perspectives to operationalize these
          commitments, concluding with a review of ethical considerations. This
          has resulted in an important and timely book for social workers truly
          wanting to respond ethically and compassionately to "the
          person-in-environment".'<br /><strong>Laura </strong

          'Fiona Gardner is one of the pioneers in considering what it means to
          be a critically reflective practitioner. In this very timely book, she
          combines her extensive knowledge and experience of both reflective
          practice and social work in a reader-friendly text that highlights the
          complexities – and importance – of taking an holistic and socially
          just approach to professional practice. Although the focus of the book
          is on social work, the eclectic body of literature upon which Gardner
          draws (ranging widely from postmodernism to environmental issues and
          First Nations perspectives) as well as her exhortation to explore
          one’s own meaning-making, including how assumptions and beliefs emerge
          from particular social and historical contexts, will also be of
          relevance to professionals in other fields. Using her own definition
          of what she calls "critical spirituality" – a process of discovering
          "what is meaningful in the context of enabling a socially just,
          diverse and inclusive society", Gardner explores various
          understandings of spirituality and religion, how these play out in
          practice and, especially, "what difference" they may make.
          Illustrating the theoretical aspects of the book with numerous
          accounts of her own and others’ practical experiences, Gardner
          deliberately seeks to engage her readers in a dialogue about life’s
          deepest questions and how we can assist one another to live it
          well.'<br /><b>Cheryl Hunt</b>, Chief Editor of the Journal for the
