            INTRODUCING 6 WOMEN WHO FOUND THE COURAGE TO SHARE<br />IMPACTFUL
            ACCOUNTS OF SURVIVAL BY DESCRIBING DEGREES OF<br />RESILIENCE MOST
            CANNOT IMAGINE COMMITTING TO.
          </p>
          <p>
            These stories of recovery take you from a place of awe and
            heartbreak to grit and resilience. They inspire you to take action
            in your life, no matter what is going on for you, to be a better
            person. Those that dared to share did so with grace, humour, and
            great self-reflection. As tears streamed down my face, I found
            myself lost in the stories as they moved from darkness to light. You
            can find real seeds of inspiration and by just reading one story,
            you could bloom to a greater perspective in your own life.

          As a fellow author, I was excited to read these stories and was drawn
          in and captivated by their beautiful storytelling. It is so telling
          that we all experience similar emotions and times of trauma, despair
          and feeling lost. The courage, commitment to doing the inner work, to
          love one’s self is daunting at times, yet so rewarding. These women
          did it with strength alongside the people - earth angels - who came
          into their lives to help them see their full potential. Their stories
          will impact and make a huge difference in the lives of others.

          The readings of these stories bring out the real in women and their
          traumatized journeys through&nbsp;life.&nbsp;Their courage to
          manage&nbsp;life, to belong in a place where they finally feel safe
          and are able to heal and move towards a new life&nbsp;with new
          meaning&nbsp;is remarkable. They all believe in the hope of recovery
          from many injuries&nbsp;as this book of inspiring stories shares
          Trauma to Recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />~ Angie Lohr ,

          After reading Diana’s collected&nbsp;stories, I felt grateful and
          inspired. Grateful because it is apparent that I and many others are
          NOT alone in our separate journeys. Inspired because each of these
          women stepped up to share their stories in order&nbsp;to provide
          strength and to elevate others. They confirm that each of us walks a
          different path but our goals and finish-lines&nbsp;are the same as we
          all seek the love and connection that allows us to thrive
          emotionally.&nbsp;
