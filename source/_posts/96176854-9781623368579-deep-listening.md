            >Take your mindfulness practice to a new healing level with guided
            meditations, journaling prompts, and restorative yoga poses.</b
          ><br /><br />World-renowned restorative yoga teacher Jillian Pransky
          came to the practice of yoga to heal herself. For much of her life,
          she subscribed to a relentless work hard/play hard mentality, burying
          parts of herself beneath the pursuit of busy-ness and accomplishment.
          It wasn’t until a devastating personal loss and health crisis thrust
          her into suffocating anxiety that she stopped racing around. As she
          began to pause and examine her actions and emotions, she found herself
          able to unlock deeply seated tension in her mind and body. Since then,
          Pransky has been devoted to studying and teaching mindfulness
          practices, deep relaxation, and compassionate listening.<br /><br />In&nbsp;<i
            >Deep Listening,</i
          >&nbsp;Pransky presents her signature Calm Body, Clear Mind, Open
          Heart program—a 10-step journey of self-exploration that she’s taught
          around the world. Derived from the techniques that healed her, the
          practice of Deep Listening invites you to pay close attention to your
          body, mind, and heart. You’re taught how to tune inward and relax into
          a state of openness, ease, and clarity. This is the new frontier in
          integrative wellness—mindfulness designed for healing.<br /><br />Pransky
          doesn’t ask you to “be your best self,” or “do more!” She asks you to
          “be here” and “do less<i>.</i>” She guides you gently through the
          stages of Deep Listening, from being present and noticing your tension
          to welcoming what you discover with softness and compassion. She
          integrates tools like guided meditations, journaling prompts, and
          restorative yoga poses to help you regard yourself with kindness and
          curiosity. Immersing yourself in the practice of Deep Listening will
          allow you to nurture your own well-being.

          “Accessible, profound, and clear, the wisdom of
          <i>Deep Listening</i> grants us a chance to greet our habitual stress
          with new eyes of kindness and compassion. Through concise, consistent,
          and cumulative practices, Jillian provides us with the context to live
          more openheartedly and transform our ways of seeing and being.”<br /><b
            >—Elena Brower, author of <i>Art of Attention</i> and
            <i>Practice You</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Jillian has a way of being with you through the pages of
          this book so that you immediately trust her as if she were a tried and
          true friend. She wants you to reap the benefits of an art form that
          she is passionate about. Her detail to setting up yoga poses creates a
          depth of relaxation that few have touched, and her honesty will open
          up your own heart. Her intention is to get us to listen deeply, which
          is exactly what the world needs now. She is successful in that
          goal.”<br /><b>—Colleen Saidman Yee, author of <i>Yoga for Life</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Deep Listening</i> by Jillian Pransky is the fruit of
          her own deep inner listening and is her gift to those who have ears to
          hear. Literally, each page is filled with practical, sage advice
          gleaned from many years of practice, many years of deep listening, and
          the wisdom accrued from a life well-lived.”<br /><b>
            —Erich Schiffmann, author of
            <i>Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Deep Listening</i> blends essential aspects of the
          vast wisdom traditions of yoga and Buddhism that will benefit yoga
          enthusiasts and meditators alike. Step by step, Jillian offers a
          powerful and wonderfully crafted program that brings us deeply into
          our own sense of wholeness and helps us inhabit an integrated and
          heart-centered practice.”<br /><b
            >—Ethan Nichtern, author of <i>Dharma of the Princess Bride</i> and
            <i>The Road Home</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>Deep Listening </i>inspires mindfulness even when
          it’s hard to sit still. It teaches how to be alone without zoning out
          and without seeking to escape. With the same loving, down-to-earth
          wisdom she brings to her classes, Jillian Pransky helps you access a
          sense of well-being. This book is a delight to work with, essential
          reading and practice for everyone who needs to slow down and
          relax—that is, for pretty much everyone in our hectic world.” <br /><b
            >—Emily Barton, author of <i>The Book of Esther</i> and
            <i>Brookland </i></b
          ><br /><br />“With <i>Deep Listening,</i> Jillian Pransky invites us
          to join her in letting go of tightly held beliefs, identities, and
          muscles so that we might discover how it feels to be comfortable in
          our own skin, grounded, and content with ourselves.” <br /><b
            >—Kaitlin Quistgaard, editor at large for <i>Mindful</i> and former
            editor-in-chief of <i>Yoga Journal<br /><br /></i></b
          >“In her book, <i>Deep Listening, </i>Jillian Pransky teaches us how
          to inhabit our bodily experience rather than be mere spectators to it.
          She invites readers to attend to patterns of thinking, moving, feeling
          and even breathing as pathways to change the possibilities the world
          holds for us by changing our potentialities. Her book opens the door
          for us to begin to grow and change.”<br /><b
