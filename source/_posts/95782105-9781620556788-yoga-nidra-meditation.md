          A practice to consciously explore wakefulness, dreaming, deep sleep,
          and the very structure of your emotional, mental, and energy bodies
          <br /><br />• Details the simple postures of Yoga Nidra, breathing
          exercises and guided meditations, and tips for maintaining awareness
          in the liminal state that precedes sleep <br /><br />• Explains how
          Yoga Nidra allows you to explore different states of consciousness and
          any blockages in the emotional, mental, and energy bodies
          <br /><br />• Includes four complete sessions as well as pointers for
          creating your own sessions <br /><br />Known as the “yoga of conscious
          sleep,” Yoga Nidra is an ancient Indian practice that allows you to
          consciously explore the states of wakefulness, dream, and deep sleep
          as well as your own psyche by combining deep relaxation with attentive
          awareness. Stemming from Hindu, Buddhist, and Tantric philosophies,
          the practice--which could be called the “sleep of the sages”--centers
          on techniques for putting the mind and body to sleep while keeping
          your consciousness alert. Through Yoga Nidra you can directly observe
          and understand specific physiological, emotional, and mental processes
          within yourself as well as experience moments of great inner
          tranquility, joy, and well-being. <br /><br />Providing a step-by-step
          guide to Yoga Nidra, Pierre Bonnasse offers a full range of practices
          focused on the time of awakening and that of going to sleep, yet
          adaptable to any time of day or night. He details the simple postures
          of Yoga Nidra and includes preparatory techniques that work with
          breath and guided meditations to help you become an attuned observer
          of your inner world. Offering tips for withdrawing the senses and
          maintaining awareness in the liminal state that precedes sleep, the
          author explores how all practices in this discipline begin with a
          phase of relaxation and observation of breathing, followed by
          immersion into a very subtle awareness of the physical, energy, and
          mental bodies. He explains how Yoga Nidra sessions allow you to
          discover “that which is held on to,” making it is easier to let go and
          become free from all states and processes. A session can explore
          different states of consciousness as well as your senses, desires, and
          fears. The higher states of more advanced sessions focus on the energy
          body and its components: the chakras, nadis, and pranavayu, the vital
          breath and autonomic functions of the body. <br /><br />Including four
          complete sessions as well as pointers for creating your own, Bonnasse
          shows how Yoga Nidra offers positive, stabilizing, and therapeutic
          effects for the body, emotions, and thoughts. It is the ideal practice
          for getting rid of stress, anxiety, and the fear of death the source
          of all other fears. Connecting Indian and Western philosophical ideas,
          the author shows how sleep can be an opportunity to practice a form of
          yoga that changes not only our nights but every minute of our days.

        <p>
          “Pierre Bonnasse’s Yoga Nidra Meditation is no glib self-help book
          about using modern yoga nidra--the practice of visualizing images,
          having awareness of breath, and remaining immobile while in a lucid,
          sleep-like state--for getting rid of stress and anxiety. It is,
          instead, an in-depth, wise, and elegantly written presentation of the
          philosophy and practice of modern yoga nidra as nothing less than a
          means of attaining a ‘taste of Being’ of Brahman. In this, the book
          itself is a kind of meditation--the kind that one may read at bedtime
          in order to facilitate slipping into sleep.”
