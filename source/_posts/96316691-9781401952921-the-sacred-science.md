            >In 2010, Nick Polizzi did something unimaginable. He assembled a
            group of eight desperately ill patients from around the world and
            brought them into the heart of the Amazon rainforest to put the
            mysterious medicines of native shamans to the test.<br /></b
          ><br />The healing journey that unfolded would change their lives—and
          his own—forever.<br /><br />In <i>The Sacred Science</i>, we join Nick
          as he explores these primordial traditions and learns firsthand what
          it takes to truly heal ourselves of physical disease, emotional
          trauma, and the sense of “lostness” that so many of us feel in these
          modern times. We venture into a place where the ordinary rules we live
          by, even survival instincts, don’t apply—where “the only thing to do
          is to step forward and be ready for anything.”<br /><br />Nick is not
          a guru or shaman; he is an ordinary guy who pieced together an
          illuminating journey, one experience at a time. In this riveting true
          story, we’re shown the many layers that must be peeled away in order
          for us to find the truth of who we are and why we’re here.<br /><br />This
          book is a bridge between the flashy, fast-moving modern world and the
          forgotten ways of a healthier, earth-connected ancestral past. You’ll
          find practices and principles of native wisdom that you can put to use
          in your own life, and you’ll gain a new understanding of what it means
          to heal.<br /><br />In the end, what will become of the eight patients
          who set out on this path with Nick? Will the exotic jungle medicines
          and harrowing rites of passage destroy them or give them a new lease
          on life?<br /><br /><i
            >Five will return with remarkable healing results. Two will return
            disappointed. One won’t return at all.</i

          "The Sacred Science is a fresh narrative about healing that is at once
          ancient and pioneering. If you desire a deep dive into the
          psychological blind spots that may block your potential to
          heal—particularly when conventional medicine has failed you—read this
          book. Polizzi is in a class by himself as a scholar of ancestral
          medicine, a gifted storyteller brimming with integrity."<br />—

          of <i>Younger</i>, <i>The Hormone Cure</i>, and
          <i>The Hormone Reset Diet<br /></i><br />"Part adventure book, part
          self-help book, part memoir, part guide into the deepest parts of your
          soul . . . The Sacred Science by acclaimed filmmaker Nick Polizzi will
          keep you on the edge of your seat as you explore the deep wisdom found
          in our world’s ancient traditions. A Must Read."<br />—
          <b>Nick Ortner</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>The Tapping Solution</i><br /><br />"Rarely are readers given the
          gift and opportunity to be introduced to the deep wisdom and healing
          that the universal practice of shamanism embraces. In The Sacred
          Science, Nick Polizzi honestly shares how native rituals immerse us in
          both the light and the shadow, carrying us through to a place of
          illumination. This book demonstrates the raw and authentic power of
          shamanism without trying to soften what is required to truly engage in
          such an ancient tradition that can provide healing in ways many never
          imagined. Polizzi and the brave souls he brought with him ventured
          together into the jungles and experienced the magic of this
          earth-based practice. Read this book slowly, absorb and digest the
          inspirational wisdom. The Sacred Science truly honors the sacredness
          of shamanic work."<br />— <b>Sandra Ingerman, M.A.</b>, author of
          <i>Soul Retrieval </i>and <i>Medicine for the Earth<br /></i><br />"In
          The Sacred Science, Nick Polizzi tells a riveting tale of exploration,
          hope, and wonder through his adventures into the Amazon. A regular guy
          from Connecticut follows his own health journey and finds the earth’s
          greatest treasure—forgotten healing plants and the native cultures who
          know how to use them. It was hard to put this book down and the ending
          delivered a wallop that everyone needs to experience."<br />—<b>
