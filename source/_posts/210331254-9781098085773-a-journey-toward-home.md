            If you are taking the first steps on your life journey or if you
            have been on the road for years, you are sure to be refreshed and
            renewed as you began to journey closer to the very arms of God. Your
            life dreams and aspirations do not have to be put on hold or out of
            reach, no matter what cards life has dealt. You can come forth and
            come out. Truly you are the one that controls your life's destiny,
            not your past faults or mistakes. This book will show just how the
            Lord can take you out, clean you up, and renew your mind, body,
            soul, and spirit.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Can God forgive and use you? My answer is absolutely because he did
            it for me, so I know that as you read my story, you will see that if
            he can forgive and restore this old country boy, then he can surely
            lift you up from your unwanted circumstances. As you read through
            this book, you will come to understand your value and purpose for
            being on earth. Christ will help you complete His very purpose in
            you. You are not too far gone to where He does not know where you
            are, and He is seeking after you.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            This book will reflect through my story, that our precious life will
            be filled with mistakes. However, we must understand that on the
            inside of those who have accepted Christ is the life of a risen
            savior. It is my hope that everyone who believes and lives for
            Christ can experience the excitement of life to its fullest and the
            abundance of blessings that God has promised to us all. I challenge
            you as you read this book from start to finish, opening your heart
            and mind to feeling the presence of the Holy Spirit and the process
            of change taking place.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Through this encounter, revitalization will begin to inspire you to
            move forward on your life journey. I have been blessed to have
            experienced God's greatness. There must be a strong desire to trust
            God's leading even when the way forward seems hidden. The journey
            ahead of you is so much brighter than the road behind you. You can
            and will complete your journey to the very arms of God.
