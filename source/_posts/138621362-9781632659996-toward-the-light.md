          Stories of ghosts and hauntings have frightened us since the beginning
          of time. Until recently, few have dared to contact the deceased and
          discover the true nature of earthbound spirits and the phenomena they
          create. Our understanding of the afterlife has evolved, and with it
          the reality that ghosts are just like us, facing many of the same
          problems we face every day. Spirit rescue mediums are “psychologists
          for the deceased,” helping them peacefully transition to the other
          side.<br /><br /><i>Toward the Light</i> is the first guide dedicated
          solely to spirit rescue and its role in saving earthbound spirits from
          their self-imposed exile on earth. It is a guide to rescue mediumship,
          a form of spirit communication used to counsel and aid the deceased in
          crossing over. It is the first book that will help you understand
          things from a ghost’s perspective, and will cover such diverse topics
          as:<br /><br />Why spirits remain earthbound and the emotions
          associated with this decision<br />Places of interest for earthbound
          spirits and the reasoning behind their residency<br />Techniques and
          tools used by rescue mediums<br />Psychic protection tools and
          techniques for all levels of spirit activity<br />The different
          vibrational levels of spirit attachments<br />Residual energy and the
          techniques used to clear it away
