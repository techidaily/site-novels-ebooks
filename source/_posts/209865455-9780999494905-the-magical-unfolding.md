          <p><strong>You can have a fulfilling life on your terms.</strong></p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Life is too short to spend it feeling constantly
              overwhelmed.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p><strong>Your time to thrive has arrived.</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Leave the busyness rulebook behind.&nbsp;</strong></p>
          <p>
            The modern world is a virtual playground – full of life-liberating
            gadgets, endless information, a myriad of digital realities at your
            fingertips, and a plethora of opportunities. Despite this instantly
            accessible abundance however, stress and anxiety levels are
            increasing and it’s become the norm to be overwhelmed and to simply
            survive, rather than thrive. It seems we have too much choice – too
            much of a good thing – and it’s hard to hear our own guidance
            amongst the noise.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The Magical Unfolding shows you how to transcend the busyness, and
            barrage of information. It guides you gently through its
            evolutionary, proven 8-step Process to uncover a fulfilling life
            lived on your terms…without becoming a Zen monk or turning your life
            upside down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Part memoir, part manifesto, and part roadmap, it weaves together
            life stories, eastern energy, intuitive wisdom, and modern-day
            psychology into a gently empowering, transformational tool that you
            can use for everyday life.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are the panacea you seek. When you learn how to master yourself,
            you can master your entire world*

            “Helen has written an unapologetically joyous guide to getting out
            of the darkness so many of us find ourselves lost in at some point
            in our lives. Her ideas and her writing bubble with lightness and a
            hard won wisdom that feels so genuine and loving.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>I believe Helen: there is magic to be found no matter what!”</p>

            “If you’re not sure who you are in the world, or you feel lost or
            stuck and want to change, The Magical Unfolding is for you.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps you were hoping for a magic wand, but we all know that life
            isn’t that simple. Instead, Helen will guide you gently, with
            empathy and understanding through a series of processes to unearth
            your own magic.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not a book of theory but, as you will read in her story,
            Helen has learned by walking the path herself. It’s a book I will
            enjoy working through slowly and will dip into again and again.”
