            Paralyzing And Eradicating Cancer By The Power Of Faith is a divine
            medication that is able to paralyze and eradicate cancer cells and
            tumors for perfected healing. In this edition, the author brings out
            God's prescription for our healing which is the Healing Word Of
            Faith(HWF). The author helps to build your Faith from zero faith to
            the faith of a hero, one that will impair the multiplication power
            and growth of cancer cells and tumors and then paralyze and
            eradicate them.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; Have you been diagnosed with cancer? I have good news for
            you, your faith can be built to exempt you from the millions that
            are dying from cancer annually. In the United States alone, more
            than one million six hundred and eighty-five thousand people are
            been diagnosed with cancer annually as of 2016. For those without
            cancer, its still required for them to get this book and build their
            faith while they are strong and healthy. With your faith built and
            rooted&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Healing&nbsp;Word&nbsp;of Faith, you can
            stand in the gap for someone suffering from terminal cancer and God
            will surely honor your faith and heal him. &nbsp;In Mark 7:26-28,
            the Greek Woman stood in the gap for her daughter and Jesus honored
            her faith and healed the daughter. In Matthew 8:5-13, Jesus by the
            reason of the Faith of the Centurion, healed his servant. By reason
            of your faith, God will surely intervene and heal your spouse,
            brother, sister, parents or even friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Faith building, especially faith in the healing
            Word of God is one of the greatest investments. It is what heals you
            from every sickness be it terminal so that you can enjoy your
            physical investments. Jesus paid the full price for your healing so
            that you can enjoy good health. The Bible say's He was wounded for
            our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities,&nbsp;the
            chastisement&nbsp;of our peace came upon Him and by his stripes, we
            were healed. Just because Jesus paid the full price for your
            healing, does not automatically mean you walk in divine health just
            as the discovery of a medication for a particular ailment does not
            automatically mean&nbsp;you are healed when you are
            diagnosed&nbsp;of that ailment. To be healed, you must take the
            medication as per the doctor prescription. The same is true with
            divine healing, The Scripture in Proverb 4:20-22 describes God's
            &nbsp;Word as medication, and like any medication must be taken as
            prescribed. The author helps to build your faith so that Word
            medication can heal you. After many years of painful suffering, I
            was finally taught in the Faith and prayer ministry, after which the
            Lord called me to write this book and build the faith of his people.
            If there is one ministry that has been abused, it is the prayer
            ministry. Many Christians and even new converts are asked to pray
            and have faith to be healed as if it is easy to pray and have faith
            without being taught. The Lord Jesus Christ, our perfect example in
            Scripture walk with the disciples for about 3 years, the disciples
            watch him pray, yet could not copy his prayer lifestyle. It was not
            until &nbsp;Chapter 11 of the Gospel of st Luck that one of the
            disciples approached him and said; Lord, "teach us to pray as John
            taught his disciples". If John the Baptist and Jesus Christ taught
            their disciples how to pray then you must be taught how to pray.
            Journey with me into this book and be taught how to pray and have
            your faith built, one that when unleashed against cancer cells and
            tumors will paralyze and eradicate them for perfected healing, in
            the mighty name of Jesus Christ !.
