            >"<i>S for Sufi</i> explores the beautiful way of achieving our
            truenature and guides true seekers towards transformation." – Azim
            Jamal, co-author of <i>The Power of Giving</i></b
          ><br /><br />For many, Sufism remains an exotic and little-understood
          subject.S for Sufi has been specifically written to lift the veil off
          from Sufism by providing an introductory yet comprehensive overture on
          the subject. Replete with popular Sufi stories, proverbs, and
          anecdotes, the book decodes the wisdom hidden in the literature,
          philosophies, doctrines, and practices of Sufism.<br /><br />By
          drawing upon the works of some of the most prominent Sufi masters,
          including Rumi, Ghazali, and Hallaj, the author offers compelling and
          fresh insights into key themes of Sufism. He breaks down all the
          proponents of this mystical tradition in a way that is at once
          inspiring, stimulating, and digestible.<br /><br />This book is ideal
          for all those who are seeking to understand the universal truths about
          life and higher consciousness. It also offers profound learnings on
          how to unlock one’s spiritual potential and break from the narrow
          confines of the material world.<br /><br />On the whole,
          <i>S for Sufi</i> is an accessible and authoritative compendium that
          invites you into the Sufi way of life.

          "Hasnain Waris has brought a lot of thought, scholarship, and heart
          into this engrossing book on the path of the Sufi, which is love. In
          simple and clear terms, the book gives us a comprehensive perspective
          of the philosophy and practice of Sufism, at the heart of which is the
          quest for the Beloved or supreme consciousness. Illustrating his
          points with delightful Sufi stories and thought-provoking excerpts
          from Rumi and other Sufi saints, while weaving in the scientific view,
          the book leads us through the journey travelled by the Sufi to reach
          the perfection he is in search of. In Sufi terms, the journey begins
          with moving from nafs-e-ammara (the animal self) to nafs-e-kamila (the
          perfect self). I enjoyed this intimate and informed book and have
          locked away in my heart a few stories and insights the book gifted
          me." —&nbsp;<b>Suma Varughese</b>, Founder-Facilitator of The Zen of
          Good Writing Course and Former Editor of&nbsp;<i>Life Positive</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Society</i> magazines<br /><br />"In&nbsp;<i
            >S for Sufi</i
          >, Hasnain Waris has introduced the path of a Sufi in the simplest
          possible way with the help of daily objects like fruits, Hindu,
          Buddhist, and Bhakti chants, and even tales of Mulla Nasruddin. The
          resultant book is a breezy memorable walk through the archways of Sufi
          mysticism. Hasnain has conceived the book in the most interesting way
          by introducing&nbsp;the fundamentals of Sufism without resorting to
          any complex narration. The author's words have a voice, and the reader
          will be able to hear him speak through the pages. A mesmerising and
          outstanding book that interested readers must not miss." —&nbsp;<b
