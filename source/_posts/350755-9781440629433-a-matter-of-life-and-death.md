          Spiritual medium and healer Rosemary Altea touched the lives of
          millions with her <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
          <i>The Eagle and the Rose</i>. In this classic work, Altea described
          how she discovered her gift, and recounted the miraculous experiences
          she had in her early years of connecting the living with the dead. In
          <i>A Matter of Life and Death</i>, she shares inspiring new stories of
          working with her spirit guide, Grey Eagle, to help sick and troubled
          people heal, to help people recognize their true path in life, or to
          help people find peace in reuniting with departed loved ones.<br /><br />Born
          and raised in England, from the time she was a young girl Rosemary
          Altea heard voices and had visions of people who had died. But feeling
          threatened by her mother, the young Rosemary kept silent about the
          strange, menacing faces she saw in the dark. In the 1970s, now in her
          mid-thirties with a ten-year-old daughter of her own, Rosemary was
          abandoned by her husband. Nearing rock bottom emotionally, she began
          to nurture her spiritual gifts. She claims it was her spirit guide
          Grey Eagle who advised her to publish her first book, The Eagle and
          the Rose. Even as the world has come to accept—even revere—people who
          have the ability to communicate with the dead, with various mediums
          gracing the bestseller list and with such television shows as The
          Medium and Ghost Whisperer high in the ratings, in recent years
          Rosemary Altea has had to struggle to realize the transformational
          power of her work. From defending her integrity as a medium in a
          vicious lawsuit to coping with the loss of a friend who was very close
          to her heart, now Altea brings us <i>A Matter of Life and Death</i>,
          detailing a new chapter in her rich personal history as she recounts
          story after story of remarkable encounters with the spirit
          world-encounters that will amaze and inspire Altea's millions of fans.
