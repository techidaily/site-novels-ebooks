            Modern Psychology and Ancient Wisdom, 2nd edition, brings together
            experts who explore the use of ancient healing techniques from
            Buddhism, Christianity, Goddess, Shamanism, Taoism, and Yogic
            traditions as well as the mystical practices of Judaism and Islam
            and their application to modern counseling and therapy professions.
            Each chapter lays out time-tested techniques used by teachers,
            guides, and practitioners to facilitate psychological healing,
            embraces a wide variety of cultural perspectives, and offers a
            large, varied, and meaningful view of the world. This new edition
            includes added material on Islam, indigenous, and shamanic healing
            perspectives and practices, as well as new findings in the fields of
            neuropsychology and epigenetics. With its vast offerings of new
            treatment methods from a variety of perspectives—from therapeutic
            metaphors and breathing exercises to meditation and yoga
            techniques—this book will be of use to mental health professionals,
            social workers, and pastoral caregivers.

          "This marvelous book comes at a pivotal time in the history of the
          human journey—a time when the deadening forces of Western technology
          appear to be overtaking our humanity—and it offers the reader real
          alternatives. It provides clear and grounded discussion of the world's
          great healing traditions, spiritual wisdom, and indigenous practices
          from several ancient sources. I particularly valued the experiential
          guidance which clients and therapy practitioners may use to reconnect
          with the life force that sustains us all. An important book."

          "<i>Modern Psychology and Ancient Wisdom, second edition, </i>recasts
          the world's wisdom traditions in frames that restore social,
          ecological and gender balance. This work is as salient as it is
          timely; a clarion call to bind oneself with the crimson thread of
          empathy that unites all seekers of transcendence. I urge believers and
          nonbelievers alike to drink from this deep well of spiritual wisdom. I
          know I will be returning to it for years to come."

          "<i>Modern Psychology and Ancient Wisdom, second edition</i>, offers a
          unique exploration of ancient healing techniques and their application
          to modern counseling and therapy professions. This compilation informs
          the contemporary dialogue about psychotherapy while also
          rehabilitating the image of incorporating the wisdom traditions into
          practice. It reflects the significant work in the integration of
          spirituality and psychology of which all practitioners of healing and
          consciousness should be aware."

          "This important book pairs holistic practices of psychospiritual
          healing with the living truths and practices that inform the world’s
          great religious traditions. Both religion and psychology are
          strengthened by this synthesis."

          at the California Institute of Integral Studies
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is a growing awareness in the world of psychotherapy that
          spirituality is an integral part of the healing process. This
          wonderful sourcebook reminds us that the world's religious and
          spiritual traditions offer practices and perspectives that can support
          the development of the whole person on the therapeutic journey.
          Practitioners as well as individuals on their own journeys will
          benefit from the resources for psychospiritual exploration offered in
          this book, and readers will discover a deeper understanding of the
          synergy between the process of psychological growth and the realm of
          spiritual insight and awakening, as reflected in the diverse
          approaches presented."
