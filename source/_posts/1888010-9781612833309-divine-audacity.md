          <b>Experience Oneness with the Divine and Light Up the World</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          On the publication of her first book, Larry Dossey, MD, author
          of&nbsp;<i>Prayer Is Good Medicine&nbsp;</i>, wrote:
          “Martella-Whitsett is a wise guide."<br /><br />
          Her new book makes the audacious claim that each of us can be “the
          light of the world” Jesus instructed his followers to be.
          Martella-Whitsett offers a path for living a deep and authentic life
          outside of the strictures of traditional religious categories. A
          refreshing approach, in essence, on how to be spiritual without being
          religious.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We need to jettison the idea of a God who is out there and above us.
          God is not a super-human who gives and takes, punishes and rewards.
          God does not require human suffering and repentance.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We truly find God when we go inside to connect with divine light,
          realize our oneness with God and others, and let our light shine in
          the world. Martella-Whittset looks at what “divine light” is and how
          it is both audacious and normal to claim it for ourselves. Next she
          introduces us to 12 spiritual powers we can all develop and learn to
          use on a daily basis: faith, understanding, will, imagination, zeal
          power, love, wisdom, strength, order, release, and life itself. When
          we consciously shine our spiritual powers on ourselves, not only are
          our lives improved, but all of humanity can be enriched and
          transformed.<br /><br />
          Let your light shine!

        <p>
          "Unity minister Martella-Whitsett is encouraging readers to sidestep
          the limitations of hierarchical religions and traditional concepts of
          God. She’s asking us to reclaim our spiritual power and give new
          meaning to the idea of “being the light in the world”. Divine
          audacity, she tells us, requires finding that light within us and
          choosing to activate the spiritual abilities that are contained within
          it. Drawing on the spiritual foundations of Unity founder Charles
          Fillmore, she covers each of twelve spiritual abilities in depth,
          including meditations to enhance awareness of each ability along with
          specific practices to increase our connection to each of those
          abilities. Written with inspiring conviction, she compares and
          contrasts familiar Judeo-Christian teachings with the idea of humans
          walking within God as part of One spirit that permeates the universe,
          rather than bowing down before a deity. Her theological language is
          just familiar enough to help readers easily understand the concepts.
          From there, however, she asks us to move into a new world, where our
          personal spiritual power is free to participate fully in an inclusive
          realm that welcomes our active engagement. Let customers know that
          this is a book about spiritual freedom and the joy of discovering what
          that means to them." --<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>,
