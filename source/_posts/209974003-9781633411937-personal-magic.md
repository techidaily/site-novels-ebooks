            >A classic of practical magic that presents witchcraft as a

          <p>
            Marion Weinstein was one of the founders of modern-day witchcraft.
            <i>Personal Magic</i> is her book of shadows, what they used to call
            a <i>grimoire</i> or book of spells. It presents her personal
            approach to witchcraft, what she learned over her many decades of
            practicing magic:
          </p>
          How to invoke the deities or spirit powers, the gods and goddesses
          that inhabit our worldThe pagan holidays—what they mean and how to
          honor themWorking with moon power throughout its phasesThe witch’s
          toolkit of spells and rituals for contacting one’s ancestors, seeking
          protection from malevolent forces, and practicing advanced
          manifestationAn exploration of the principles of self-realization
          through witchcraft
          <p>
            “In the old days,” she writes, “a ‘Book of Shadows’ was kept for
            joyful reasons—to pass on the work to others. Every witch who could
            write had one.” During times of repression, these works were a way
            of preserving the religion. “Today, we are back to the original
            purpose of sharing the craft with others.” This book is Marion’s
            gift to you. It is also an invitation to start creating your own
            book of shadows.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Personal Magic</i> is filled with how-tos and practical advice
            that shows readers how to unlock their psychic abilities to guide
            them in the creation of their own unique and personal magical work.
            Every technique is explained in detail, in keeping with Weinstein's
            proviso that one should never attempt to work any magic unless one
            understands it fully.<br /><br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Marion Weinstein</b> (1939–2009) was an author, teacher, media
          personality, and proud New York "city witch." Known as "The Ethics
          Witch," she is one of the founders of the modern witchcraft movement.
          She was the first to coin the phrase and define Positive Magic, and
          clearly delineate its use. Her radio show,
          <i>Marion's Cauldron,</i> was the first regularly scheduled Wiccan and
          psychic programming on record, and was a New York phenomenon for
          fourteen years.
