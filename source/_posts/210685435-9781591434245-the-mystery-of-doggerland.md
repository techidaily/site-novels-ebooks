            >A scientific exploration of the advanced ancient civilization known
            as Doggerland or Fairland that disappeared 5,000 years ago</b
          ><br /><br />• Looks at the latest archaeological and scientific
          evidence preserved beneath the North Sea and on the tiny island of
          Fair Isle<br /><br />• Examines Doggerland’s sophisticated technology,
          including how its people were able to melt solid rock to create
          vitrified structures far stronger than concrete<br /><br />• Shows how
          the survivors of the destruction of Doggerland sailed to the British
          Isles and established the megalithic culture that built Stonehenge<br /><br />New
          marine archaeological evidence has revealed the remains of a large
          landmass to the north of Britain that hosted an advanced civilization
          1,000 years before the recognized “first” civilizations of ancient
          Egypt, Mesopotamia, or India. Remembered in Celtic legends as Tu-lay,
          and referred to by geologists as Doggerland or Fairland, this
          civilization began at least as early as 4000 BCE but was ultimately
          destroyed by rising sea levels, huge tsunamis, and a terrible viral
          epidemic released from melting permafrost during a cataclysmic period
          of global warming. <br /><br />Exploring the latest archaeological
          findings and recent scientific analysis of Doggerland’s underwater
          remains, Graham Phillips shows that this ancient culture had
          sophisticated technology and advanced medical knowledge. He looks at
          evidence detected with remote sensing and seismic profiling of many
          artificial structures, complex settlements, gigantic earthworks, epic
          monoliths, and huge stone circles dated to more than 5,500 years ago
          preserved beneath the ground and on the ocean floor. He also looks at
          the small part of the Fairland landmass that still exists: Fair Isle,
          a tiny island some 45 miles north of the Orkney Islands of Scotland.
          Phillips shows how, when Fairland sank beneath the waves around 3100
          BCE, its last survivors traveled by boat to settle in the British
          Isles, where they established the megalithic culture that built
          Stonehenge. <br /><br />Revealing the vast archaeological evidence in
          support of the existence of Doggerland, as well as its threads of
          influence in early cultures around the world, Phillips also shows how
          the fate of this sophisticated ancient culture is a warning from
          history: the cataclysmic events that happened to the first
          civilizations could happen again as the world heats up.

          “Graham Phillips’s well-researched, well-written book neatly places a
          number of missing pieces in the puzzle of the Orkney megalithic
          tradition and the broader ancient region of Doggerland. He presents
          these in context with a range of informative viewpoints on prediluvian
          cultures including Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria.”
