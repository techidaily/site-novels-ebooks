          <b>Welcome to a master class in mindfulness.</b><br /><br />
          Jon Kabat-Zinn is regarded as "one of the finest teachers of
          mindfulness you'll ever encounter" (Jack Kornfield). He has been
          teaching the tangible benefits of meditation in the mainstream for
          decades. Today, millions of people around the world have taken up a
          formal mindfulness meditation practice as part of their everyday
          lives. But what is meditation anyway? And why might it be worth
          trying? Or nurturing further if you already have practice?
          <br /><br /><i>Meditation Is Not What You Think </i>answers those
          questions. Originally published in 2005 as part of a larger book
          entitled <i>Coming to Our Senses</i>, it has been updated with a new
          foreword by the author and is even more relevant today. If you're
          curious as to why meditation is not for the "faint-hearted," how
          taking some time each day to drop into awareness can actually be a
          radical act of love, and why paying attention is so supremely
          important, consider this book an invitation to learn more -- from one
          of the pioneers of the worldwide mindfulness movement.
