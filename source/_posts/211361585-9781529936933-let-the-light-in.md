            <b>The instant <i>Sunday Times</i> bestseller</b><br /><br />'Life
            is what you make it, nothing is for free<br />Stand up and be
            counted, and be who you want to be'<br />'Let The Light In' Jane
            McDonald<br />Jane was planning a golden retirement with her beloved
            partner Ed, when a shocking cancer diagnosis changed everything. Ed
            was terminally ill. Jane nursed him at home until the end, on her
            own, with the UK in lockdown. At first she was overwhelmed, but
            slowly gathered strength from caring for her loved one, and now sees
            that it was a privilege to be there for him.<br /><br />'Let The
            Light In', a song Jane wrote over twenty years ago during another
            dark time, points the way to finding a new kind of joy out of
            sorrow. It's a philosophy Jane has always lived by and, in this
            deeply personal book exploring the same themes, she reveals the
            lessons she's learned that have helped her grow, adapt and rise up
            through adversity. She looks back with candour and honesty on her
            experiences of heartbreak and loss, failure and burn-out. Cherishing
            the ring of support around her, taking the odd duvet day and keeping
            a sense of humour throughout, she grew stronger through each
            challenge, building resilience, trusting her gut, going for her
            goals.<br />Read on and let Jane McDonaldâ€™s fabulous light into your
            own life.<br />
