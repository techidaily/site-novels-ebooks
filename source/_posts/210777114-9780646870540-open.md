            <strong>OPEN</strong> is a liberating guide to awaken you from old
            stories into a life of self-led freedom.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In a world of spiritual bypassing, this book includes easy to
            implement tools to integrate your personal truth into action and to
            embody the insights from the lessons that show up in your own life
            for growth.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Jessie Moss is an intuitive awakening facilitator who shows you from
            a place of vulnerability that
            <strong>you are not your stories</strong>.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            After arriving at these teachings through her own experiences with
            domestic violence, abuse, overcoming trauma, PTSD, anxiety, and
            addictions, Jessie encourages you to rise from your own learnings
            and adversity to follow what sets your soul on fire.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            You get to transform through the higher frequency of your heart,
            align all areas of your life from within, and open to the highest
            possibilities of love and liberation.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Open is your invitation to go on a journey through personal stories,
            incantations, and practices, to&nbsp;heal and take charge of your
            wellbeing, discover yourself on a deeper level, and realise you have
            the power to choose in each moment.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Travel in and through your own unique path to self-mastery where you
            can unlearn your conditioning to rebuild a new way to live, rewire
            old patterns, and authentically land yourself deeply centred to that
            place within, where your values, ideals, and actions align with
            ease.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Imagine you are standing at a crossroads. You see the well-paved
            embedded ways of the past before you, probably giving you a false
            sense of security and comfortability. Now see the other path you
            haven't walked before, which may seem scary and possibly a little
            exciting as you take in the uncharted territory that lay before
            you.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            By seeing them and feeling what each path represents you give
            yourself an <strong>opportunity to choose</strong>.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Whatever the choice you make, you now have a full knowing that this
            is what you are calling in for yourself as you take each step
            forward.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            If you were to see yourself at the crossroad now with nothing but
            truth in your heart, what is the outcome of your choice?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Is it serving you?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Does it feel good?&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Do you want to choose again?&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p><strong>What will you decide?</strong></p>

          Jessie Moss has a unique and nurturing nature, a writing style that
          draws the reader into a safe and comforting world to allow your soul
          and spirit to awaken from old stories and narratives. 'Open' is full
          of self-empowering and motivational guides, inner work reflection
          guidelines, and personal empowerment suggestions which everyone can
          benefit from. A great gift from an author who has used her personal
          life experiences to provide a way forward and a sense of hope to
          others. Written with love, thoughtfulness, and generosity.
