          Explores Rupert Sheldrake’s more than 25 years of research into
          telepathy, staring and intention, precognition, and animal
          premonitions <br />
          <br />• Shows that unexplained human abilities--such as the sense of
          being stared at and phone telepathy--are not paranormal but normal,
          part of our biological nature <br />
          <br />• Draws on more than 5,000 case histories, 4,000 questionnaire
          responses, and the results of experiments carried out with more than
          20,000 people <br />
          <br />• Reveals that our minds and intentions extend beyond our brains
          into the world around us and even into the future <br />
          <br />Nearly everyone has experienced the feeling of being watched or
          had their stare result in a glance in their direction. The phenomenon
          has been cited throughout history in nearly every culture, along with
          other commonplace “paranormal” occurrences such as premonitions and
          telepathy. <br />
          <br />In this newly updated edition, Sheldrake shares his more than 25
          years of research into telepathy, the power of staring, remote
          viewing, precognition, and animal premonitions. Drawing on more than
          5,000 case histories, 4,000 questionnaire responses, and the results
          of experiments on staring, thought transference, phone telepathy, and
          other phenomena carried out with more than 20,000 people as well as
          reports and data from dozens of independent research teams, Sheldrake
          shows that these unexplained human abilities--such as the sense of
          being stared at--are not paranormal but normal, part of our biological
          nature. He reveals that telepathy depends on social bonds and traces
          its evolution from the connections between members of animal groups
          such as flocks, schools, and packs. Sheldrake shows that our minds and
          intentions extend beyond our brains into our surroundings with
          invisible connections that link us to each other, to the world around
          us, and even to the future.

          “Dr. Sheldrake offers his theory of morphic resonance as an
          explanation for telepathy, precognition, remote viewing and other
          innate psychic abilities. As living organisms, he contends, we
          comprise multiple fields that are linked to our collective memory. An
          extraordinary book which hails our seventh sense.”
