          • Examines the Oldawan, the Ancient Soul of Africa, and its
          correlation with what modern psychologists have defined as the
          collective unconscious <br /><br />• Draws on archaeology, DNA
          research, history, and depth psychology to reveal how the biological
          and spiritual roots of religion and science came out of Africa
          <br /><br />• Explores the reflections of our African unconscious in
          the present confrontation in the Americas, in the work of the Founding
          Fathers, and in modern psychospirituality <br /><br />The fossil
          record confirms that humanity originated in Africa. Yet somehow we
          have overlooked that Africa is also at the root of all that makes us
          human--our spirituality, civilization, arts, sciences, philosophy, and
          our conscious and unconscious minds. <br /><br />
          In this extensive look at the unfolding of human history and culture,
          Edward Bruce Bynum reveals how our collective unconscious is African.
          Drawing on archaeology, DNA research, depth psychology, and the
          biological and spiritual roots of religion and science, he
          demonstrates how all modern human beings, regardless of ethnic or
          racial categorizations, share a common deeper identity, both
          psychically and genetically--a primordial African unconscious.
          <br /><br />
          Exploring the beginning of early religions and mysticism in Africa,
          the author looks at the Egyptian Nubian role in the rise of
          civilization, the emergence of Kemetic Egypt, and the Oldawan, the
          Ancient Soul, and its correlation with what modern psychologists have
          defined as the collective unconscious. Revealing the spiritual and
          psychological ramifications of our shared African ancestry, the author
          examines its reflections in the present confrontation in the Americas,
          in the work of the Founding Fathers, and in modern Black spirituality,
          which arose from African diaspora religion and philosophy.
          <br /><br />
          By recognizing our shared African unconscious--the matrix that forms
          the deepest luminous core of human identity--we learn that the
          differences between one person and another are merely superficial and
          ultimately there is no real separation between the material and the
          spiritual.

          "All in all, Bynum has made a comprehensive case for the need to
          rekindle the connection to our African unconscious, which has not just
          been lost, but actively repressed. I’m deeply impressed with the
          objectivity Bynum maintained while writing so passionately about this
          subject. With a topic that could run high with tension and volatility,
          Bynum has taken a measured, level approach to present this
          information, and I admire how he calls for honoring and celebrating
          common roots, rather than further separation among humankind. I will
          absolutely be integrating Bynum’s wisdom for a while and I know I will
          be returning to <i>Our African Unconscious</i> time and again, as I’m
          sure there’s more to absorb with each and every read."
