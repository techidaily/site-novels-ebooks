            >In his new book, <i>Energetic Diagnosis</i>, Dr. Neil Nathan,
            renowned physician and bestselling author of <i>TOXIC</i>, delivers
            his groundbreaking thesis on diagnosing disease and chronic illness
            using the patient’s personal energy fields as the launchpad for
            treatment. </b
          ><br /><br />
          An individual’s energy is often overlooked when treating
          difficult-to-identify disease. Dr. Nathan puts forth the premise that
          patient evaluation should be highly personal, beginning with a
          thorough analysis of events leading up to sickness, including
          lingering mental trauma. To do this, he urges medical professionals to
          use a process called Energetic Intuition—the ability to utilize
          pattern recognition presented by our own subconscious. <br /><br />In
          this book, Dr. Nathan details how he taps into his own intuition and
          learns to trust both himself and what the patient’s physical and
          mental state tell him. Dr. Nathan’s personal experience and years
          using this methodology have helped hundreds of patients understand
          their ailments and a find balance that helps them achieve optimal
          health. <i>Energetic Diagnosis</i> also features a robust detailing of
          how human energy is measured and perceived in a clinical setting using
          specific medical devices, interference fields, and various autonomic
          response testing. Dr. Nathan invites guest doctors to detail the kinds
          of energy-focused treatments they use in their practices, such as
          A.R.T. (autonomic response testing), kinesiology, and FSM (frequency
          specific microcurrents). <br /><br />Dr. Nathan concludes the book
          with important energetic considerations to open and build our
          awareness for a total mind, body, soul experience. He reveals the
          importance of dreams, native healing, and communication with the
          natural world.

          <span>About the Author</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Neil Nathan</b>, MD, has been practicing medicine for forty-seven
          years. He has been Board Certified in Family Practice and Pain
          Management and is a Founding Diplomate of the American Board of
          Integrative Holistic Medicine and a board member of the International
          Society for Environmentally Acquired Illness (ISEAI). For many years,
          he has worked primarily with patients who had not received a diagnosis
          from conventional medical sources, and especially with patients whose
          illness has made them unusually sensitive and toxic (hence difficult
          to treat). This book has grown out of his experience in this field,
          and it is his hope that it will enable many patients, currently
          suffering and without a diagnosis, to begin to find their way toward
          health. <br /><br />Dr. Nathan has lectured to medical audiences both
          nationally and internationally. He has written several books,
          including
          <i
            >Healing Is Possible: New Hope for Chronic Fatigue, Fibromyalgia,
            Persistent Pain, and Other Chronic Illnesses</i
          >;
          <i
            >On Hope and Healing: For Those Who Have Fallen Through the Medical
            Cracks</i
          >; and
          <i>Mold and Mycotoxins: Current Evaluation and Treatment 2016</i>. He
          has hosted an internationally syndicated radio program/podcast on
          VoiceAmerica called
          <i>The Cutting Edge of Health and Wellness Today</i>. He also is a
          researcher and has published several papers, the most important being
          “Metabolic Features of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome” with Dr. Robert
          Naviaux. Dr. Nathan’s medical practice is the Redwood Valley Clinic in
          northern California. He can be contacted through his website,
          www.neilnathanmd.com.
