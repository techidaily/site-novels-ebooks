          The core teachings and riotous life of the psychedelic yogi Ganesh
          Baba <br />
          <br />• Presents the teachings of Ganesh Baba’s “Crea” Yoga, which he
          derived from the tantric practices of traditional Kriya Yoga <br />
          <br />• Explains the basic exercises for following the Crea (creative)
          Yoga practice <br />
          <br />• Includes many anecdotes from the colorful life of this
          “psychedelic” baba <br />
          <br />Shri Mahant Swami Ganeshanand Saraswati Giri (ca. 1895-1987) was
          known to all who loved and studied with him simply as Ganesh Baba. At
          the age of four, he was brought back from death through an initiation
          by Lahiri Mahasaya and through this initiation descends from the same
          Kriya Yoga lineage as Paramahansa Yogananda. He became a swami under
          his guru Sivananda and later went on to run the Anandamayi Ma ashram.
          Drawn to the life of the Naga Babas, he became the head of the Ananda
          Akhara, Naga followers of Lord Shiva who consider cannabis and other
          entheogens to be the gift of the gods. The unique set of principles
          and exercises Ganesh Baba developed from the tantric practices of
          traditional Kriya Yoga and Shivaism became the core of his personal
          teachings of Crea (for creative) Yoga. Ganesh Baba’s message of
          systematic synthesis of the spiritual and secular was carefully
          developed for and embraced by contemporary students in the 1960s,
          especially those whose path included the use of entheogens. <br />
          <br />This book contains the core of Ganesh Baba’s Crea Yoga
          teachings, from the beginning stages of conscious control of one’s
          posture, breath, and attention to finally extending one’s awareness to
          the farthest reaches of the cosmos. Eve Baumohl Neuhaus shows that the
          life of this scholar and crazy saint was as instructive as his
          teachings. She includes many personal reminiscences of this
          inspirational and challenging teacher from her own life and those of
          fellow students, which demonstrate that Ganesh Baba’s extraordinary
          life was in keeping with his own role as the embodiment of Lord
          Ganesh, the remover of obstacles.
