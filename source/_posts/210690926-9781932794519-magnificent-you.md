            "I've never known life without the Council. To be honest, I'm pretty
            sure they go by many names: Higher Power. God. Jesus. Abraham.
            Higher Consciousness. You get the drift. It's that same still small
            voice that abides in all of us. Problem is, most people don't
            listen; either they don't have the time, patience, inclination, or
            some other reason. Either way, finding, not to mention listening, to
            that voice can transform your life into something amazing." - M.
            Culpepper

          <p>
            In this unprecedented age of world wide communication, where much is
            said and so little is understood, the Council of Threes, channeled
            by Margaret Culpepper, thrives in an environment of simplicity. They
            boil down complex topics into their most basic form that highlights
            what it means to be a beautiful spirit housed in a physical form.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In this second volume, they explore physicality... you... and what
            that means. Discussion topics include:
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            * Who you are. Why you're living at this point in history. And why
            your presence means so much
          </p>
          <p>
            * What is the nature of this thing called "reality?" And exactly how
            much of it are you able to control?
          </p>
          <p>
            * What is the most important stage of physical life? Why is it so
            important? How can you maximize your presence during that time?
          </p>
          <p>
            * Some say the veil between the physical and spiritual thins at a
            certain time of the year. Is this true? If not, when is the optimal
            time to contact spirit?
          </p>
          <p>
            * The care and feeding of the human body. What, exactly, is the best
            food plan for maximum health? Is there one? How to discern the truth
            about diet and live a long, healthy physical life. (It's easier than
            you think!)
          </p>
          <p>
            * How to describe yourself with two, short words. And how that
            description changes everything for the better.
          </p>
          <p>
            * What is the role of others in your life? Is human hierarchy valid
            and if so, how can you use it to your advantage?
          </p>
          <p>* Why belief is irrelevant. If you do this, all is well.</p>
          <p>* And much more...</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            If you're searching for a God who's big enough to handle your
            emotions, strong enough to answer your questions, and kind enough to
            actually love... crack open this book and begin your amazing journey
            toward your true home.
