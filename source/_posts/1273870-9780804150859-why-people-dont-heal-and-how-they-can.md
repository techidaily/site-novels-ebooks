            >A bold account of the development of human consciousness and
            spirituality over the ages and an examination of the dynamic global
            transformation of attitudes about healing.</b
          ><br /><br />For more than fifteen years, Caroline Myss has studied
          why some people heal, while others do not. In her previous book,<i>
            Anatomy of the Spirit,</i
          >
          Dr. Myss illuminated the hidden interactions of belief and body, soul
          and cell to show how, as she inimitably puts it, "your biography
          becomes your biology." In
          <i>Why People Don't Heal and How They Can</i>, she builds on her
          earlier teachings of the seven different energy centers of the body to
          provide a vital self-healing program for physical and spiritual
          disorders. With her characteristic no-nonsense style and high-voltage
          storytelling, she exposes and explodes the five myths about healing,
          explains the cultural and individual contexts in which people become
          physically and spiritually ill and invested in "woundology," and
          teaches new methods of working with the challenges that the seven
          energy centers embody.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />To
          help you get and stay on the path to wellness, Dr. Myss provides
          rituals and prayers for gaining a symbolic perspective on your life
          issues; for bolstering your personal power; and for connecting with a
          universal divine energy. Dr. Myss's breakthrough views on energy
          medicine and her active approach to healing life issues and physical
          illness will help you overcome the mental blocks that keep you from
          becoming well.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Caroline Myss</b> earned her B.A. in journalism, her M.A. in
          theology, and her Ph.D. in energy medicine. In 1982, she began working
          as a medical intuitive, one who "sees" illness in a patient's body by
          intuitive means. In 1994 she stopped giving such readings (which
          Harvard-trained neurosurgeon C. Norman Shealy estimated to be 93%
          accurate), opting instead to deliver her message to a wider audience
          through lectures and workshops. Her schedule is now booked two years
          in advance, and her workshops draw an average of 1,000 people each. In
          1996, Harmony Books published Myss's book
          <i>Anatomy of The Spirit</i>, which continued to hit bestseller lists
          a year after publication. As Sounds True's bestselling audio author,
          Myss sells hundreds of audiotapes each week. In December 1997, PBS
          aired a&nbsp;nationwide show on Caroline and her work, titled
          <i>Why People Don't Heal and How They Can</i>.
