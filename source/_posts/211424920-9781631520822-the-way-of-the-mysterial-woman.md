          <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> is for every woman who feels the
          call into greatness, authenticity, and meaningful living. This is The
          Way for women who are stepping into their lives with mind, body,
          heart, and soul fully engaged, ready to awaken to their true
          potential. We hear the clarion call, but how will we meet it? It’s
          almost like we need a completely new internal operating system. The
          Mysterial Way is the upgrade we’ve been searching for. Women’s
          leadership development pioneers and co-authors Suzanne Anderson and
          Susan Cannon know that we’re not alone in our yearning to meet this
          call. In fact, they assure us that this is a naturally occurring
          global imperative for women.
          <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> reveals a Feminine source code,
          helping us once and for all break through our old limitations, and
          effectively take our lives to the next level so we can meet the unique
          callings and urgent challenges of these dynamic times. This is not a
          passive book for armchair travelers. Drawing upon real life success
          stories, based on their 12 years of running University certificate
          women’s leadership programs, readers are guided through a
          step-by-step, transformative “Mysterial Sequence.” Each interactive
          chapter offers practical and fun insights and practices that compel us
          toward genuine shifts and solid growth.
          <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> is a blend of cutting edge
          transformational psychology, ancient Mystery school secrets, and
          visionary evolutionary thinking delivered in a warm, down-to-earth
          style. Here is the elegant code we‘ve been searching for that finally
          unlocks our greatest potential.

          “In <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i>, Suzanne Anderson and Susan
          Cannon present their brave, pioneering, richly-informed proposals for
          the advance of womankind. This is a big and unique set of proposals,
          which is bound to enlarge our thinking about both the thwarting and
          liberation of our greater potentials. It's time now for women to get
          out of jail. Reading this book, I say ‘hurrah’!" —Michael Murphy,
          co-founder of the Esalen Institute and author of
          <i>The Future of the Body</i><br />
          “<i
            >The Way of The Mysterial Woman: Upgrading How You Live, Love, and
            Lead</i
          >
          is awesome! Here I am at 85 reading it with recognition of so many
          growth potentials still to come in my own life! The ‘Mysterial Woman’
          offers a new source code for our culture. Beyond equality and
          empowerment lies the evolving woman, a new archetype I have named the
          Feminine Co-Creator. It is a new map for women. She’s in the midst of
          an evolutionary move, between mystery and manifestation at the edge of
          a new world. With great compassion and wisdom we are guided through
          dynamic steps toward a new level of wholeness. Highly recommended.”
          —Barbara Marx Hubbard, The Foundation for Conscious Evolution and
          author of
          <i>Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our Social Potential</i
          ><br />
          “In their excellent book, <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i>, Susan
          Cannon and Suzanne Anderson describe sophisticated yet user-friendly
          leadership models and techniques that are empowering for women and men
          alike. <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> reveals the full
          complexity of the mature Feminine essence, providing a new source
          code—a fundamental set of inner instructions for personal and
          professional growth.” —Steve McIntosh, author of
          <i>The Presence of the Infinite</i>, and president of the Institute
          for Cultural Evolution<br />
          "In their new book, Suzanne Anderson and Dr. Susan Cannon engage a
          recognition that could not be more timely and significant: current
          images of realization for women, those that in recent decades have
          provided more equal roles and essential new freedoms, while important,
          are not in themselves enough. The book’s sensitive inquiry into what
          more must lie ahead is richly pertinent not just to the lives of
          women, but also to broader questions of what will be needed if
          humanity as a whole is to progress in ultimately rewarding ways.”
          —Charles Johnson, M.D., author of
          <i>Cultural Maturity: A Guidebook for the Future</i>, and founder of
          the Institute for Cultural Maturity<br />
          “<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> presents a code, a sequence of
          experiences that, if followed in order, delivers a woman to a place of
          wisdom, love, and power beyond any prior accomplishments in business
          or service or personal life. This transformational pathway is rooted
          in the co-authors collective years of graduate studies, coaching,
          research, and leading cohorts of intelligent and soulful woman.
          Anderson and Cannon have mapped what could be called a rite of passage
          for women who are ready to draw up the love of being from the well of
          the Feminine and combine that with the creative action of the
          Masculine in ways that are both powerful in the world and nourishing
          in their personal lives.” —Vicki Robin, author of
          <i>Blessing the Hands that Feed Us</i> and
          <i>Your Money or Your Life</i><br />
          “<i>The Way of The Mysterial Woman</i> is an amazing compilation of
          wisdom and practice. Our most successful leaders will recognize this
          book’s guidance as akin to what they follow. What Anderson and Cannon
          provide is a well-researched, practical roadmap for how woman can
          consciously develop this capacity to positively guide the future. Men
          should read this—and not enough of us will. We all, male and female,
          need to lean in this book’s direction and become our deeper, truer
          selves. The next generation will be very grateful that we did!” —Geoff
          Bellman, consultant and author of <i>Your Signature Path</i><br />
          "<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> brings health, depth, and
          clarity to the rising feminine voice. Flip through it, you’ll catch
          the vision. Read it, you’ll feel the challenge. Work through it and
          you will grow." —Rev. Samuel G. Alexander, author of
          <i>Evolving Christianity, Life After Faith Crisis</i><br />
          "Ever longed for a more fulfilling, joyful life, enriched by deep
          relationships and satisfying accomplishments? Anderson and Cannon
          offer an original roadmap for achieving such a dream. Derived from
          their own life journeys, years of research and work with women, they
          draw together myth, psychology, complexity science, and more. The
          resulting alchemical mix is a nuanced, comprehensive, and actionable
          approach that changes how women live, love, and lead, with exciting
          implications for us as individuals and as a society." —Peggy Holman,
          author of
          <i>Engaging Emergence: Turning Upheaval into Opportunity</i> and
          co-author of <i>The Change Handbook</i><br />
          “<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> is a powerful, resonant, and
          original offer to the world. I loved every chapter—especially when I
          followed the “Mysterial Sequence” and found myself in all the
          archetypes and their fascinating shadows. Think of this as a
          transformational guidebook—as life changing as
          <i>The Artist’s Way</i>, anchored in a conversation as groundbreaking
          as <i>Women Who Run With the Wolves</i>. This is our time and this is
          our book.” —Gail Hudson, writer, life coach and co-author with Jane
          Goodall of

          “<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> at once heralds, activates, and
          incarnates a worldview shift of inconceivable proportions. If that
          sounds exaggerated, we would do well to submit ourselves to Suzanne
          Anderson and Susan Cannon’s tutelage here, which transmits the
          Mysterial disposition and capacity they describe and gives such
          superbly realized, informed, and tested guidance for achieving it.
          Though it fiercely celebrates and serves women, this book has much
          insight for both the Feminine and the Masculine in men too. If anyone
          wants a viable path beyond chronic Hypermasculinity, take off your
          spurs and your helmet, press your palms together before your heart,
          enter in, and go all the way through this book, doing the work you
          find here that really calls to and challenges you. The journey may
          change you more than you can presently imagine.” —Saniel Bonder,
          author of <i>Waking Down: Beyond Hypermasculine Dharmas</i>,
          co-founder, Human Sun Institute<br />
          “What a rich book! Like the wise women they are, Anderson and Cannon
          take us by the hand and guide us confidently through the
          transformation that is already underway for thousands of women—and
          men—who have felt the tug of the Mysterial potential within. In
          delineating five clear stages and multiple practices to support the
          maturation of integral capacities at each stage, the authors have
          created an elegant map for a brave new emerging model of leadership.
          Brava!” —Belinda Gore, PhD, senior faculty at The Deep Coaching
          Institute, author of

          <i>The Ecstatic Experience: Healing Postures for Spirit Journeys</i
          ><br />
          “This book provides a compelling, overarching theory of human, and
          particularly women’s, development. It weaves multiple psychological,
          sociological, futurist, and philosophical systems into a stunning arc
          of individual and societal development. But the book goes beyond
          theory. This is a working manual. You can feel the traction given this
          work by the ten years of on-the-ground training, coaching, and
          consulting that were the cauldron from which the vision and methods
          emerged. As a man, I learned more about myself and about women, and I
          completed this book inspired and hopeful. There is little doubt that
          the emergent feminine power is sadly and deeply needed in our atomized
          and hierarchically damaged world. If there is one thing to take from
          this book, it is the confident and well-etched vision of feminine
          capacity fully realized and its potential influence on our world’s
          future.” —Gregory Kramer, co-creator of Insight Dialogue, founder of
          the Metta Foundation, and author of

          <i>Dharma Contemplation: Meditating Together with Wisdom Texts</i
          ><br />
          “Let's face it. The masculine leadership that has run the world for
          millennia is a double-edged sword. Its focus on hard science, economic
          growth, military might, and political dominance has left us a world
          that, despite the consumer cornucopia produced by its powerful
          technologies, is coming apart at the seams from war, greed, climate
          change, and over-exploitation of resources. And until now, much of the
          world’s female political leadership has gotten where it has by
          governing in the same way and with the same priorities. But The
          Mysterial Woman—using carefully developed new paradigms and
          illustrative case studies—uncovers a new way of female leadership
          capable of bringing about the ‘great transformation’ our world so
          deeply needs. In this book, Susan Cannon and Suzanne Anderson bring
          all of their insight together in one volume. Beautifully written and
          clear, this is a book for both men and women who believe that another
          world is possible and much needed." —John de Graaf, co-author of
          <i>Affluenza</i> and <i>What’s the Economy for, Anyway?</i><br />
          “Original, dynamic, compelling, and eminently practical,
          <i>The Mysterial Woman</i> is a blessing of a book for any women whose
          inner guidance system is nudging her to grow into her authenticity and
          wisdom to make a powerful contribution to the world, one that is hers
          alone to make. Rich with lyrical content, as well as down-to-earth
          action, Cannon and Anderson’s book is a step-by-step guide to
          recognizing and freeing ourselves from our limiting beliefs and
          patterns. This is one of those books you’ll want to keep as a
          reference, but also one you’ll recommend to others, so buy several
          copies!” —Kerul L. Kassel, author of
          <i>The Thinking Executive’s Guide to Sustainability</i><br />
          “Anderson and Cannon had me when they used the expression ‘the long
          emergency.’ They were talking about the world situation, but I felt
          they were looking at my life. And so it continued, page after page.
          They were by my side on a journey through the book—my companions as I
          saw through a new lens, analyzed from a new perspective, and made
          choices using a new way of knowing. Perhaps you, yourself, are
          experiencing ‘the long emergency.’ Perhaps you are at one of life’s
          critical intersections and unsure which way to go. Perhaps you are
          feeling stuck without even knowing why. The Way of the Mysterial Woman
          will help you answer the question: What next? It can help you to
          decide mindfully and spiritually, and then to move forward with
          confidence, courage, and hope.” —Ruth Middleton House, EdD, president
          of Middleton-House &amp; Company and author of
          <i>It’s Time to Change the Way You Change</i><br />
          “<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> offers a ground-breaking look
          at women’s leadership that is beautifully written and deeply thought
          provoking. Susan and Suzanne draw from the worlds of mythology,
          leadership theory and proven practice to create a path for women to
          EVOLVE. This book inspires the reader to think bigger and make the
          changes required to revolutionize the way we lead. If we do this, it
          will have a profoundly positive impact on society.” —Maureen Metcalf,
          author of the award-winning <i>Innovative Leadership</i> book
          series<br />
          "<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> offers women leaders a pathway
          to inner discovery through multi-dimensional self-evaluation,
          understanding of mythological prototypes, and common sense. The
          well-researched, beautifully written book gives its readers an
          approach that is both intelligent and compassionate. It allows them to
          embrace their inner strengths as women and unique human beings."
          —Julie Benezet, founder of The Journey of Not Knowing® and Academic
          Advisor, Harvard Graduate School of Design Executive Education,
          Challenges of Leadership<br />
          "<i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> is an elegant, deep, and
          personal call for women to arise at this moment in history and
          activate their power to lead humanities’ story forward. This is more
          than a book—it’s a repository of wisdom that evokes a new way of
          being, and offers a detailed path forward called the mysterial
          sequence to open the doorway. If you are a woman who wants to love
          herself, or a man wants to bring the full life of your woman into the
          world, this is your guidebook." —Ross Hostetter, author of
          <i>Keepers of the Field</i>, and lead teacher of the Fieldwork
          School<br />
          "When the Dalai Lama famously suggested that the world will be saved
          by Western women, he was talking about the kind of 'Mysterial women'
          who emerge from the processes that inform this deeply wise guidebook.
          It details a powerful alchemical journey of spiritual and
          psychological integration that manifests in real-world wisdom and
          leadership. Usefully, it’s grounded with real-life examples from
          participants in the authors’ leadership academy. It also offers a
          profoundly insightful integral lens that enables the reader to
          understand all the dimensions of each step of her transformation,
          inner and outer, personal and relational. This guidebook sets a new
          standard of excellence, depth, thoroughness, and systematic clarity."
          —Terry Patten, author of <i>Integral Life Practice</i><br />
          “What if it were no accident that we came to earth at this time to
          bring a particular presence into the challenges of the day? What if
          women were especially needed now, with our strength, beauty, unique
          instincts, and affinity with the earth? What if the discontent,
          yearning, confusion, depression, and exhaustion we are feeling signal
          the awakening of our full Self, pressing to be set free?
          <i>The Way of the Mysterial Woman</i> answers these questions with
          hard-won experience, decades of research, workshop by workshop, client
          by client. What Suzanne and Susan offer is no less than an initiation
          into our true nature and personal calling. Highly recommended to any
          woman who feels like she is cracking out of an old shell!" —Barbara
