          Animals / Mind Body Spirit <br /><br />Millions of family pets, often
          otherwise physically fit and healthy, are put to death every year to
          give human companions peace and rest from their incontinence,
          unruliness, excessive noisiness, aggression, possessiveness,
          destructiveness or other inconvenience. A behavior problem often
          becomes a ‘terminal disease’. Indeed euthanasia for behavior problems
          is the main cause of death in young animals, and many people regard it
          as a treatment. The high cost of veterinary attention also results in
          many animals being discarded or neglected by their owners. The
          consequent price of animal suffering, and cost of human regrets and
          need for welfare services, are incalculable.They are also avoidable.
          <br /><br />Correcting the behavior problem often saves an animal’s
          life as effectively as surgery or other medical procedures, and
          greatly reduces the suffering of all concerned. It does not require
          expensive behavior therapy or extensive behavior modification on the
          part of the owner. It can be brought about in many cases quite simply
          and inexpensively through the use of flower essences. This book offers
          descriptions of each of the 38 Bach Flower Remedies, and their
          application to the treatment of a range of domestic animals, including
          horses and farm, wild and zoo animals. It also describes diagnostic
          symptoms, animal by animal, together with appropriate treatment
          regimens, illustrated with case material obtained from veterinarians,
          animal behavior specialists and health practitioners.
          <br /><br />Other important and helpful areas discussed are: <br />•
          emotions in animals and their influence on behavior <br />• the
          emotional bond between animals and humans <br />• the pros and cons of
          thinking of animals in human terms <br />• the principles of flower
          remedies and their suitability for usein the treatment of animals.
          <br /><br />Helen Graham was a Lecturer at Keele University, England,
          and is the author of several books on psychology and complementary
          medicine. She breeds Salukis, and lives in rural France with her
          husband. Gregory Vlamis is a researcher and author of bestseller Bach
          Flower Remedies to the Rescue. He has been researching the life and
          work of Dr. Edward Bach since the early 1970s, and divides his time
          between the USA and Greece.
