          • Explains the three distinct architectural styles found at the
          majority of sacred sites, representing three ancient world ages<br /><br />•
          Examines evidence of the two oldest architectural ages at sites in the
          Sacred Valley of Peru in depth, connecting them to other sites around
          the world<br /><br />• Explores the sophisticated science behind the
          construction of these stone sites, including modern research on
          acoustic levitation and ancient use of geopolymers<br /><br />All
          around the world are mysterious ancient monoliths with strange
          features—perfectly carved terraces, massive steps, basins, and
          abstract forms with underground grottos and cave systems. Most
          archaeologists have a hard time explaining them and attribute their
          construction to the earliest known cultures in the area.<br /><br />Examining
          sacred sites in Peru and their counterparts around the world,
          researcher and journalist Camille M. Sauvé shows how these sites share
          specific architectural characteristics and reveal evidence of a very
          ancient culture that once existed worldwide. She examines the work of
          Peruvian researcher Alfredo Gamarra, who first described in detail the
          three distinct building styles and construction methods of these sites
          and how they represent three ancient world ages. She explains how
          Hanan Pacha ("heaven above") constructions, the oldest style, are
          universally revered as sacred by the civilizations that came after
          them. Weaving together a tapestry of what early humanity looked like,
          Sauvé examines the writings of famous clairvoyants like Rudolf
          Steiner, Madame Blavatsky, and Edgar Cayce who recorded the works of
          early man through the Akashic records.<br /><br />Besides the more
          esoteric questions about who could have built these wonders, Sauvé
          also examines the unique properties of the monoliths themselves and
          the sophisticated science behind the construction of these stone
          sites. She shows how they seem to be placed on earth power spots and
          how most of the rocks have significant piezoelectric properties from
          high quartz and silica content. <br /><br />Revealing that many sacred
          sites are much older than previously thought, Camille Sauvé shows that
          Peru may hold the secret to remembering our forgotten prehistory.

          “In <i>Sorcerers of Stone</i>, Camille Sauvé conjures up a visionary
          and transformative archaeological experience. She guides her readers
          deeply into the magical world of mysterious megalithic monuments with
          a focus on Peru and Bolivia. Going beyond the imposing physicality of
          these perplexing lapidary manifestations, she takes us into more
          esoteric topics such as sonic manipulation of stone, advanced human
          life in distant ages, and more.”
