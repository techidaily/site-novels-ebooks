              >Self-defeating behavior is something that many people struggle
              with, but it’s not always clear where the behavior stems from.
              &nbsp; These self-imposed limitations are toxins, preventing us
              from achieving the love, success and happiness we deserve in our
              lives.&nbsp;</strong

              plan. &nbsp; Nicole shares her experiences growing up in an
              atmosphere where addiction, denial, lying, and keeping secrets was
              the norm.&nbsp; Within the chapters, you will be guided through a
              journey that taps upon these eye-opening topics:</strong

              and uncovers the link from the experience to the type of behavior
              it can manifest in your life.&nbsp; This book offers three
              revelations of action to transform behavior from self-defeating to
              life-enhancing. Feeling the pain, healing from the pain and then
              letting go of that pain.&nbsp; With anecdotes and usable insights
              drawn from personal experiences, Nicole shares ideas that have
              helped her overcome pain, fear and confusion and how to approach
              life's challenges with confidence, love, courage, and even
              humor.&nbsp;</strong

              into the discomfort instead of the human instinct to avoid it,
              Nicole’s message provides practical steps toward change that can
              be worked into everyday life - Feel It. Heal It.&nbsp; Let It Go
              leads you to stop subscribing to the painful yet stagnant stories
              of your past, create momentum and emerge into the most incredible
              version of yourself yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong
