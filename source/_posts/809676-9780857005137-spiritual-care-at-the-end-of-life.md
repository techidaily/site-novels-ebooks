            Chaplains in healthcare settings offer patients spiritual care that
            involves companionship, counselling and maintaining hope. This is
            particularly important at the point where a patient has run out of
            treatment possibilities. This book reflects creatively on the work
            that chaplains do with people who are dying and the unique quality
            of the relationship that palliative care professionals construct
            with patients at the end of life.<br /><br />Based on qualitative
            research with practising palliative care chaplains, Spiritual Care
            at the End of Life explores the nature of hope in its different
            forms at different stages of terminal illness, and asks how
            chaplains can help dying people to be hopeful even when facing the
            inevitability of their death. The book identifies key moments in
            this relationship, from the person's initial reaction to the
            chaplain, to the chaplain becoming an accompanying presence and
            creating the potential to provide comfort, strength and "hope in the
            present".<br /><br />This thoughtful and inquisitive book
            investigates the underlying theory that spiritual care is rooted in
            relationship. It has implications for practice in the work of
            chaplains, counsellors and all healthcare professionals supporting
            people who are dying.

          This is an extraordinary book. Steve Nolan invites his readers to
          enter into those intimate moments between the health care professional
          and the person who is dying in which hopes and fears are held together
          in sometimes painful but beautiful experiences of spiritual integrity.
          The book draws on material from interviews with hospice chaplains, but
          its insights into spiritual care have much to offer any worker in
          palliative care services. Using the concept of 'dwelling', Nolan
          explores the idea of the worker as 'presence' - a dynamic interaction
          between two people in proximity to death in which my death and death
          of another become fused. We often talk about empathy in this field,
          but Steve Nolan has explored empathy with the person who is dying in
          all its demanding, challenging and privileging richness.
