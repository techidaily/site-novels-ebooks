          The first book to explore the history and influence of egregores,
          powerful autonomous psychic entities created by a collective group
          mind <br /><br />• Examines the history of egregores from ancient
          times to present day, including their role in Western Mystery
          traditions and popular culture and media <br /><br />• Reveals
          documented examples of egregores from ancient Greece and Rome, Tibetan
          Buddhism, Islam, modern esoteric orders, the writings of H. P.
          Lovecraft and Kenneth Grant, and the followers of Julius Evola and
          Aleister Crowley <br /><br />• Provides instructions on how to
          identify egregores, free yourself from parasitic and destructive
          entities, and destroy an egregore, should the need arise
          <br /><br />One of most important but little known concepts of Western
          occultism is that of the egregore, an autonomous psychic entity
          created by a collective group mind. An egregore is sustained by
          belief, ritual, and sacrifice and relies upon the devotion of a group
          of people, from a small coven to an entire nation, for its existence.
          An egregore that receives enough sustenance can take on a life of its
          own, becoming an independent deity with powers its believers can use
          to further their own spiritual advancement and material desires.
          <br /><br />Presenting the first book devoted to the study of
          egregores, Mark Stavish examines the history of egregores from ancient
          times to present day, with detailed and documented examples, and
          explores how they are created, sustained, directed, and destroyed. He
          explains how egregores were well known in the classical period of
          ancient Greece and Rome, when they were consciously called into being
          to watch over city states. He explores the egregore concept as it was
          understood in various Western Mystery traditions, including the Corpus
          Hermeticum, and offers further examples from Tibetan Buddhism, Islam,
          modern esoteric orders such as the Order of the Golden Dawn and
          Rosicrucianism, the writings of H. P. Lovecraft and Kenneth Grant, and
          the followers of Julius Evola and Aleister Crowley. The author
          discusses how, even as the fundamental principles of the egregore were
          forgotten, egregores continue to be formed, sometimes by accident.
          <br /><br />Stavish provides instructions on how to identify
          egregores, free yourself from a parasitic and destructive collective
          entity, and destroy an egregore, should the need arise. Revealing how
          egregores form the foundation of nearly all human interactions, the
          author shows how egregores have moved into popular culture and
          media--underscoring the importance of intense selectivity in the
          information we accept and the ways we perceive the world and our place
          in it.

          "The idea of egregores could inspire paranoia in a certain kind of
          personality, and of course that is unwise. But it is no doubt a good
          idea to remember that false idols can take the form of thoughts and
          ideas as well as objects. Stavish's book is a timely, intelligent, and
          enjoyable reminder of this truth."
