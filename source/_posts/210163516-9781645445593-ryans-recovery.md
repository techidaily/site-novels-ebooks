          <p>
            Ryan's Recovery: The Darkest Before the Dawn takes you on a journey
            of almost twenty years in time, starting in 2000 and ending in 2019.
            It is a story of heartache to triumph and everything in between,
            raising an autistic child. Ryan Ward went from being diagnosed as
            severely autistic with only echolalic speech, no need for human
            affection, and no understanding of the world around him, to becoming
            an artist and a working adult with high-functioning autism. The time
            line starts in the midst of recovery protocols and goes back in time
            to reveal the entire story. It is a story of climbing out of
            complete despair, confusion, and depression, to standing up and
            making a difference. It truly shows you what it takes to put someone
            first in your life in every aspect. Everyone will say they put their
            children first, but when it comes to special-needs children, this
            phrase takes on an entirely different meaning. The book guides you
            through special diets, homeopathic protocols, several different
            therapies such as OT, PT, sensory, visual, behavioral, chiropractic,
            and craniosacral. It also touches on battles with school
            authorities, IEP meetings, and bullying. The story also shows how
            autism has the ability to interfere with marriages, relationships
            with other children in the family, social life, and just plain daily
            living. It does, however, also send the message that if you put your
            mind, heart, and soul into anything you want to accomplish, that
            nothing is impossible. It is a story that proves that when presented
            with a mountain that looks too high to climb, you find a way to
            tunnel under the mountain, go around the side of the mountain, or
            fly over it if you have to; but you never ever give up. In the end,
            the story will show you that no matter which way you choose to get
            to the other side of the mountain, you will indeed get there, and
            when you do, the feeling of accomplishment and pride in what you
            have done makes all the difficult times in the past only a stepping
            stone that got you there. What seemed impossible twenty years ago
            has now become reality, and walking through this journey with my now
            adult son has made me a stronger person and given me the confidence
            to know there is nothing that can't be obtained with the correct
            professionals, friends, family, and love.
