            >“A thoughtful and fresh perspective on life’s compassionate journey
            to success. <i>Irrational Kindness </i>is powerful, provocative, and
            palatable.” —Linda Cash, former Vice President, Quality and New
            Model Launch Program at Ford Motor Company</b
          ><br /><br />
          This work from a fast food entrepreneur and rare triple-franchisee
          Kevin Williams was written as part-employee handbook, part-operating
          manual for life. <i>Irrational Kindness</i> flips traditional wisdom
          on its head and gives a different lens through which to look at
          life.<br /><br />
          Often the idea of being irrational is smeared with negative
          connotations. It can sound illogical, senseless, unjustifiable, or
          groundless. It may even represent ludicrous and mad behavior! But
          Kevin Williams argues that being irrational can be just the opposite.
          And it is the most positive, inspiring, and empowering way to be.
          Being irrational has to do with thinking outside the box—way outside.
          It has to do with viewing life as a journey and still being willing to
          reverse the route, shake things up, or flip the map upside down. Why?
          Not just to be different, but to
          <i>make a difference</i>.<br /><br /><i>Irrational Kindness</i> can
          serve as a harmonious reminder that one’s hopes and dreams do not have
          to be derailed—not by their fears, their pasts, or by people who make
          them feel like they have to know everything to be successful, or even
          just to get started. Throughout its pages, Kevin provides the
          inspiration everyone needs to favor understanding over being
          understood and prioritize kindness—toward themselves as well as
          others—over everything.<br /><br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Kevin Williams</b> is one of only a few triple-franchisees within
          Chick-fil-A, one of America’s fastest growing companies. After
          graduating with a degree in Management Information Systems from the
          University of Georgia and working in banking for nearly five years, he
          switched gears to follow his passion as an entrepreneur. This path has
          led Kevin to become an incredible Waffle-Fry Cook, a creative
          recording artist, a collector of potentially useless domain names, a
          lover of all medium-roast coffees, a proud husband to one wife, and a
          blessed father to four children. He currently resides in Canton, GA.
