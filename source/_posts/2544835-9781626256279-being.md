          "Spiritual" dialogues usually aim to guide the seeker towards
          enlightenment, towards escape from identification as a suffering
          individual. In <i>Being: The Bottom Line</i>, however, Nathan Gill
          points out that "enlightenment" only appears significant from the
          viewpoint of "me" - it's only the story of "me" that requires
          enlightenment. Your true nature is Being, and Being is already all
          that is (even when there is seeming ignorance of that), with no
          requirements whatsoever.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Born in 1960 into a working-class family in South-East England,
          <b>Nathan Gill</b>’s early fascination with the mysteries of the body
          and the universe led him to experiment with diet and herbal
          treatments, and to push his body to the limit with weight-training and
          body-building. When a shoulder injury brought the weight-training to
          an end, his thoughts turned to spiritual and esoteric matters. His
          investigations led him to the teachings of Da Free John, whose message
          that we are already awake and need no liberation struck a strong
          chord, and eventually to Tony Parsons and the philosophy of
          non-duality.<br /><br />
          One day, in September 1998, when Nathan was gardening in the drizzling
          rain: “I looked up, and there was a subtle sense of ‘me’ not being
          there. I got on my bike and cycled around the lanes and it seemed as
          though there was a movie going on, without any effort necessary on my
          part to be taking part in it.”<br /><br />
          Whilst this event had a profound impact on him, he came to discover
          that such happenings where the ‘I’ suddenly disappears could actually
          be very confusing: “Such an event may last a few seconds or ten years
          or more, but unless the ‘I’ is seen for what it is – as simply a
          thought – then when this ‘I’ returns, there is a sense of loss, a
          sense of confinement in being an identified character again.”<br /><br />
          He went on to hold meetings where, with characteristic humour and
          acuity, he shared his profound understanding that: “Any coming and
          going is merely the play of life. As far as Your nature as Being is
          concerned, the absence or presence of a personal self is
          inconsequential. Being simply is, and all of these appearances and
          happenings may simply be described as the cosmic entertainment.”<br /><br />
          During his years of spiritual seeking, Nathan was divorced, married
          and divorced again, a single parent to his two daughters throughout
          most of their school years, working as a gardener in a small village
          in Kent. His health, however, never robust, deteriorated increasingly
          over time and he became weaker and weaker. Unable to work and with no
          prospect of a cure, rather than live in pain and dependency, in June
          2014 he took the decision to end his own life.
