          <b>The Owner's Manual for Your Life!</b><br /><br />
          Founded in the twentieth century by the late spiritual teacher Ra Uru
          Hu, Human Design is often called the "new Astrology," and the
          "intersection of science and spirituality." Your Human Design chart is
          formulated by taking your birth date, time, and location and
          extrapolating specific personality traits and life paths from this
          convergence. A Human Design chart offers an astonishingly accurate
          guide to your personality, as well as direction and counsel on how
          each individual can deal with challenges in their life.<br /><br />
          Previously, Human Design charts have been notoriously difficult to
          interpret and decipher, usually taking a dedicated expert to read and
          translate them into plain English. At least, that used to be the
          case--until now.<br /><br />
          In
          <i
            >Understanding Human Design: The Science of Discovering Who You
            Really Are</i
          >, author Karen Curry walks you through the sometimes complex and
          intimidating Human Design chart with simple, direct language. You will
          learn about each level of Human Design, from the most basic elements
          of the chart to the deeper, more nuanced insights Human Design offers,
          all in an approachable and interesting way. Understand how every line,
          intersection, and symbol correlates to a personality trait that can
          directly affect your life with an experienced guide by your side.<br /><br />
          Your personal Human Design Chart can reveal your strengths, your
          weaknesses, and perhaps most importantly, your potential. Prepare for
          repetitive difficulties that you might encounter throughout your life,
          and embrace the opportunity to grow as you understand your personal
          Human Design strategy. With author Karen Curry's assistance and
          knowledge, you have a path to overcome these difficulties simply by
          following the directions set out in your Human Design chart, the
          "owner's manual" to your life.
