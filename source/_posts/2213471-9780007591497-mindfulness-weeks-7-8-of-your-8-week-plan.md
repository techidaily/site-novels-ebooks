            Available as a four fortnightly mini-programs or a full length
            e-book, this revolutionary 8-week Mindfulness program gives you the
            mental flexibility to manage your emotions, implementing cognitive
            therapy strategies to lower stress levels, anxiety and mental
            pressures, and achieve perfect balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weeks 7-8 focus on taking good care of yourself, using breathing
            space and choosing an action step that brings a sense of
            satisfaction, achievement and control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Living mindfully involves acceptance and change in order to
            understand reactions. A key step to becoming self-aware is
            understanding stress and its effects on kindness and compassion.
            These last weeks will tie together the key ways to continue staying
            mindful and how to keep making progress for the rest of your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Made up of a hybrid of the two most popular approaches to
            Mindfulness currently sweeping the world, Mindfulness: Weeks 1-2
            helps establish crucial life skills, such as learning to control
            behavior and regulate the body’s natural processes with meditation,
            while also enhancing emotional intelligence, proven to be associated
            with efficiency, good social skills and an increase in self
            awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start the journey today. Strengthen relationships with friends and
            family, reach your full personal and academic potential and detox,
            de-stress and de-clutter your mind with Weeks 1-2 of Mindfulness in
            Eight Weeks.
