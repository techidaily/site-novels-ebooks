            >I have read a slew of spiritual books over the years and I have to
            say that "ONE...Embracing Life and Illuminating YOUR Spirit!" is one
            of the few that offers such a thoughtful combination of deep
            spiritual truths with real life examples including many of the
            common areas we humans can suffer or fall and then grow and awaken
            to the fact that we are all ONE. ONE allows the reader to embrace,
            or more deeply embrace their spirituality in a much more attainable,
            practical and real way. The flow of the book, through each "chakra"
            or energy center, will be familiar to anyone who has studied energy
            medicine, yoga or other ancient teachings, and for those unfamiliar
            with the chakra systems, ONE offers a great breakdown which will
            help the reader better understand where blockages or breakthroughs
            can occur and the emotional/physical/spiritual connection we all
            experience...as we are all ONE. This is definitely a must have book
            to add to your collection!</span
