          Why has a tiny old mining town straight out of Gunsmoke or Deadwood —
          Crestone, Colorado — become home to twenty-five spiritual centers
          representing nearly all the brand-name faiths of the world? With the
          keen eye of a storyteller, the insights of a scholar, and the heart of
          a seeker, Jeffery Paine narrates a truly unique adventure. He explores
          Crestone’s wintry, oxygen-thin mountain geography and introduces a
          cast of spiritual mavericks and unlikely visionaries. Paine finds in
          Crestone a remarkable dedication to coexistence. Paradoxically, the
          town’s amazing spiritual diversity highlights fundamental
          commonalities in a way that will strike and even inspire believers,
          agnostics, and searchers of every stripe.

        </h4>
        <p>
          “A witty, in-depth exploration of a unique place and its spiritual
          inhabitants.”<br />
          <strong>— Foreword</strong> (starred review)<br />
          <br />
          “Crestone is now home to twenty-five spiritual communities, including
          Vajrayana, Zen, Catholic, and Hindu. Enlightenment Town is the
          fascinating story of how these communities live and thrive side by
          side.”<br />
          <strong>— Lion’s Roar</strong><br />
          <br />
          “Who knew that among the mountains of Colorado there exists a town
          devoted to enlightenment — and boasting twenty-five religious centers,
          coexisting in perfect amity? How is that possible? In Enlightenment
          Town, Jeffery Paine takes us on a journey to meet its unforgettable
          inhabitants in Airstream trailers, disused mineshafts, and quiet
          retreats, across nineteen years. Fascinating, beautifully written,
          often funny, sometimes weird — you will love this modern Thoreau.”<br />
          <strong>— Nigel Hamilton,</strong> award-winning biographer of JFK,
          Thomas Mann, Bill Clinton, Bernard Montgomery, FDR, and others and
          senior fellow at the University of Massachusetts, Boston<br />
          <br />
          “In Enlightenment Town, readers go on the most uncanny, humorous,
          profound, and completely surprising journey to the heart of the
          spiritual Wild West. If you thought you knew what makes contemporary
          pilgrims tick, guess again. Jeffery Paine gives us wonderfully vivid
          portraits of renegade seekers of truth. He anoints our language with
          his splendid prose; he is our most creative journalist-scholar of
          religion. An indispensable book.”<br />
          <strong>— Howard Norman,</strong> author of The Bird Artist and My
          Darling Detective<br />
          <br />
          “What if Thornton Wilder had read The Tibetan Book of the Dead before
          writing Our Town? What if Norman Rockwell had spent time in a Native
          American sweat lodge and then decided to paint spirit animals? What if
          Billy Graham had befriended Allen Ginsberg and they had done ayahuasca
          together? This is the sort of wild nowhere/everywhere American
          landscape Jeffery Paine describes with great flair, courage, and
          insight in Enlightenment Town.”<br />
          <strong>— Dana Sawyer,</strong> author of Aldous Huxley: A Biography
          and Huston Smith: Wisdomkeeper<br />
          <br />
          “Paine . . . is an open-minded pilgrim who has written an edifying and
          entertaining book about his journey to Crestone, Colorado.”<br />
          <strong>— Spirituality &amp; Practice</strong><br />
          <br />
          “Enlightenment Town is a generous, delightful book, full of divine
          misfits and quasi-saints who have dared — or been forced — to widen
          their (and our) horizons. You won’t be able to resist Jeffery Paine’s
          openness to this community, nor his sly proposal that spiritual life
          can be both gentler and quite a bit wilder.”<br />
          <strong>— Kate Wheeler,</strong> Buddhist teacher and author of Not
          Where I Started From<br />
          <br />
          “I am not a religious man. Perhaps my few years incarcerated in a
          South Indian missionary boarding school cured me of this quest. But as
          Jeffery Paine intimates, even those of us who are ‘postreligious’
          nevertheless seek some ‘hallowed understanding’ of the human
          condition. Paine writes such vivid stories about Crestone’s eclectic
          spiritual characters that, I have to confess, I am charmed beyond
          belief.”<br />
          <strong>— Kai Bird,</strong> Pulitzer Prize–winning biographer and
          author of The Good Spy: The Life and Death of Robert Ames<br />
          <br />
          “With warmth, wit, and tenderness, Jeffery Paine introduces us to a
          remarkable community where the secular and the sacred exist side by
          side — often indistinguishably. What is it about a small mountain town
          in Colorado that has drawn Buddhists, Christian mystics, Sufis, and a
          host of other denominations to live together, not with mere tolerance
          but with something approaching transcendence? Whatever their secret,
          the residents of what Paine calls a ‘Wild West Jerusalem’ have lessons
          for all of us.”<br />
          <strong>— Tim Folger,</strong> science journalist and series editor of
          The Best American Science and Nature Writing<br />
          <br />
          “Whenever we open our hearts with unconditional love and illumine our
          brains with boundless wisdom, everything arises as the world of
          enlightenment. Enlightenment Town portrays a true land of Dharma,
          where this can happen.”<br />
          <strong>— Tulku Thondup,</strong> author of The Healing Power of Mind
          and The Heart of Unconditional Love<br />
          <br />
          “In Enlightenment Town, Jeffery Paine takes us on pilgrimage into the
          heart of what it means to be human. In Crestone, Colorado, home to the
          world’s most religiously diverse community, we venture high into the
          mountains on sacred vision quests and into cathartic sweat lodges, and
          join spiritual activists ‘on the path.’ We leave behind the old stale
          debate of religion vs. atheism — and belief vs. nonbelief — as we see
          people living their enlightenment. Joining this pilgrimage, you will
          be well rewarded.”<br />
          <strong>— Matteo Pistono,</strong> author of In the Shadow of the
          Buddha and Meditation<br />
          <br />
          “Enlightenment Town is a lively meditation on the nature of religion
          and an inquiry into the dynamics of spirituality, articulated with
          genuine compassion, empathy, and warm, humane humor. A personal and
          heartfelt exploration of the spiritual, Jeffery Paine’s quest situates
          him in the town of Crestone, high in the mountains of central
          Colorado, where he interacts with a quirky cast of fascinating
          characters, spiritual beings from diverse traditions — Hindu, Tibetan
          Buddhist, Carmelite Christian, Jewish, Taoist, Native American — all
          of whom have something profoundly in common and each of whom teaches
          Paine something about the myriad meanings of our relationships with
          nature and other human beings. As the journey progresses, Paine begins
          to understand and show us the ways in which everything, no matter how
          mundane, may be appreciated in some way as sacred.”<br />
          <strong>— Lee Siegel,</strong> author of Love in a Dead Language,
          Trance-Migrations, and other books<br />
          <br />
          “Via Crestone, CO, Jefferey Paine chronicles the strange reality of
          being a mind and body on earth, our interconnectedness and the
          necessity of having to rely on one another. A fascinating read.”<br />

          Love
