              >From a lifelong spirit&nbsp;communicator and professional medium
              comes a wealth of insight and exercises&nbsp;to guide you in
              communicating with spirit, defining your spiritual&nbsp;path, and

            A respected spirit medium, certified spiritual coach, and Reiki
            healer, Amanda R. Edwards helps people connect with spirits and find
            support, confidence, and peace of mind. In&nbsp;Quiet Voice, Awesome
            Power, Amanda reveals how spirit isn’t an inaccessible world where
            deceased loved ones disappear, but a significant part of us and all
            life around us. She shares how to ready your mind-body-spirit
            ecosystem to welcome powerful daily guidance from spirit; how to
            invite new experiences, heal hurtful ones, and move beyond loss; how
            to engage your body’s physical form to receive and impart messages;
            and much more. This unique volume, a hands-on, practical guide with
            exercises throughout, will connect with readers who, like Amanda,
            found themselves the “weird kid” because of a quieted spiritual
            ability and those who are new to or practiced in spirit channeling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside this pivotal guidebook, you’ll find:<br />-Insight into what
            spirit is and why it matters to connect with it.<br />-Guidance on
            readying your mind, body, and soul to engage with spirit.<br />-Instructions
            to recognize signs and interpret the “language” spirit uses with
            you.<br />-The know-how to commune with spirit through both
            traditional and personalized methods.<br />-An understanding of how
            to live a more connected, more empowered life using your
            natural-born gifts.
          </p>
          <p>
