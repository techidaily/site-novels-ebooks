          There is a place in the Nevada desert the size of Belgium that doesn't
          officially exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the airbase where test flights of
          our top-secret experimental military aircraft are conducted and --not
          coincidentally--where the conspiracy theorists insist the Pentagon is
          hiding UFOs and aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is Dreamland--or Area
          51.&nbsp;&nbsp;For Phil Patton, the idea of writing a travel account
          of a place he couldn't actually&nbsp;&nbsp;visit was
          irresistible.&nbsp;&nbsp;What he found was a world where Chick Yeager
          and the secret planes of the Cold War converged with the Nevada Test
          Site and alien landings at Roswell.<br /><br />A think tank for
          aviation engineering, Dreamland can be seen from a summit outside the
          base's perimeter, a hundred miles north of Las Vegas.&nbsp;&nbsp;On
          Freedom Ridge, groups of airplane buffs gather with their camouflage
          outfits and binoculars.&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the Stealth chasers, the
          Skunkers, guys with code names like Agent X and Zero, hoping for a
          glimpse of the rumored raylike shapes of planes like Black Manta and
          "the mother ship."&nbsp;&nbsp;The most mysterious craft is Aurora, the
          successor to the legendary U-2, said to run on methane and fly as fast
          as Mach 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanning the same horizon, the UFO buffs are
          looking for the hovering lights and doughnut-shaped contrails of alien
          aircraft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they looking at something sinister and
          mysterious?&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagined?&nbsp;&nbsp;Or more terrestrial than
          they think?&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dreamland</b> shows how much we need mystery
          in the information age, and how the cultures of nuclear power and
          airpower merge with the folklores of extraterrestrials and earthly
          conspiracies.<br /><br />Patton found people who found themselves in
          the mysteries of the place.&nbsp;&nbsp;John Lear, the son of aviation
          pioneer Bill Lear--who gave his name to the jet--served as a pilot for
          the CIA's Air America, but back home, he became fascinated by UFOs and
          eventually believed in it all: the underground bases, the alien-human
          hybrids, the secret treaties.&nbsp;&nbsp;But was he a true believer,
          or part of a disinformation campaign?&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Lazar seems to
          know when the saucers will come, and has made three clear sightings at
          night along Dreamland's perimeter, but is his story real, or a vision
          of what's possible?<br /><br /><b>Dreamland</b> is an exploration of
          America's most secret place: the base for our experimental airplanes,
          the fount of UFO rumors, an offshoot of the Nevada Test
          Site.&nbsp;&nbsp;How this "blackspot" came to exist--its history, its
          creators, its spies and counterspies--is Phil Patton's
          tale.&nbsp;&nbsp;He tunnels into the subcultures of the conspiracy
          buffs, the true believers, and the aeronautic geniuses, creating a
          novelistic tour de force destined to make us all rethink our
          convictions about American know-how--and alien inventiveness.
