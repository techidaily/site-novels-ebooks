            Human existence depends on relationships. Our brains rely on
            interconnected neural networks to function. Our minds relentlessly
            encode complex matrices of meaning to make sense of the world. And
            our physical and psychological development is contingent on the
            social bonds we share with others.<br /><br />Mindful Relationships:
            The Seven Skills for Success integrates the science of mind, body
            and brain to reveal how stress undermines these relationships, and
            what we can do about it.<br /><br />Chronic stress threatens our
            wellbeing and relationship success by creating systemic
            dysregulation of the mind, body and brain.<br /><br />This
            dysregulation leaves us relying on primal defense strategies like
            aggression and withdrawal, and inhibits key cognitive-behavioral
            capacities essential to relationship success such as accurate
            appraisal, effective coping, and coherent communication.<br /><br />The
            inspirational and accessible book introduces the BREATHE model - an
            evidence-rich approach that synthesizes the science of mind, body
            and brain to alleviate stress, increase self-awareness,
            self-regulation, and emotional intelligence, and cultivate resilient
            social bonds.<br /><br />These Seven Skills are essential tools for
            creating and maintaining a healthy, harmonious, and successful
            relationship with yourself and others.<br /><br />Filled with sound
            science, engaging stories and experiential exercises, this book is
            bound to change the way that you relate to your life and those in
            it.
