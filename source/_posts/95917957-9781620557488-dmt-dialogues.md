          Cutting-edge explorations and discussions of DMT experiences and plant
          sentience from leading luminaries in the field of psychedelic
          research<br /><br />• Includes contributions from Rupert Sheldrake,
          Rick Strassman, Dennis McKenna, Graham Hancock, Jeremy Narby, Erik
          Davis, Peter Meyer, David Luke, and many others <br /><br />• Explores
          DMT beings, plant sentience, interspecies communication, discarnate
          consciousness, dialoguing with the divine, the pineal gland, the
          Amazonian shamanic perspective on Invisible Entities, and the science
          behind hallucinations <br /><br />Encounters with apparently sentient
          beings are reported by half of all first time users of the naturally
          occurring psychedelic DMT, yet the question of DMT beings and plant
          sentience, interspecies communication, discarnate consciousness, and
          perhaps even dialoguing with the divine has never been systematically
          explored. <br /><br />In September 2015, ten of the world’s leading
          luminaries noted for exploring the mysterious compound DMT
          (dimethyltryptamine) gathered with other researchers at Tyringham Hall
          in England to discuss the subject. Over three days, they pooled their
          expertise from a wide range of subjects--archaeology, anthropology,
          religious studies, psychology, neuroscience, chemistry, and
          psychopharmacology, to name a few--to explore the notion of
          “entheogenic plant sentience” and the role of DMT as a conduit between
          Spirit and Matter. <br /><br />Offering cutting-edge insights into
          this visionary domain, this book distills the potent exchange of ideas
          that occurred at Tyringham Hall, including presentations and
          discussions on DMT entities, the pineal gland, the possibility of DMT
          as a chemical messenger from an extraterrestrial civilization, the
          Amazonian shamanic perspective on Invisible Entities, morphic
          resonance, and the science behind hallucinations. Contributors to the
          talks and discussions include many leading thinkers in this field,
          including Rupert Sheldrake, Rick Strassman, Dennis McKenna, Graham
          Hancock, Jeremy Narby, Erik Davis, Ede Frecska, Luis Eduardo Luna,
          Bernard Carr, Robin Carhart-Harris, Graham St. John, David Luke,
          Andrew Gallimore, Peter Meyer, Jill Purce, William Rowlandson, Anton
          Bilton, Vimal Darpan, Santha Faiia, and Cosmo Feilding Mellen.

        <p>
          “<i>DMT Dialogues</i> is a courageous attempt in the best tradition of
          the scientific process to wrestle with the meaning of anomalous DMT
          experiences, reported by a substantial number of people, involving the
          sense of being in touch with alien intelligences. Like all great
          mysteries, there is no single interpretation that everybody who
          participated in the <i>DMT Dialogues</i> arrived at by consensus.
          Reading <i>DMT Dialogues</i> will not bring you certainty but rather
          will bring you in direct contact with profound minds struggling to
          plumb the depths of consciousness.”
