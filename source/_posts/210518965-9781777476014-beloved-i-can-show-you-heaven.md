          <strong>A True Story of Love After Death</strong>
          <p>
            When Jennifer's husband of 25 years dies unexpectedly, her heart
            breaks and her life is torn apart. When her husband Joe realizes his
            horrific death, he finds unbelievable ways to communicate with his
            beloved wife.

          <p>
            In desperation, she delves deeply into the spiritual realm and finds
            healing with the help of her soul mate from beyond the grave. Joe,
            who was a gifted genius in life, shares powerful messages from the
            hereafter about past lives, karma, Source energy, personal
            empowerment, what happens when we die, and even sheds light on the
            souls of suicides.

            state of separation. He implores us to use our ability to
            communicate with the divine and to merge with higher consciousness
            to create unity in our world.
