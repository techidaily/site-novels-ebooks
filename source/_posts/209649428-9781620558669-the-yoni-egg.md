          Reveals the practices and rituals of the yoni egg for physical,
          emotional, sexual, and spiritual growth and healing <br /><br />•
          Explains how to use a yoni egg at different stages of life to access
          inner beauty and wisdom, improve your sex life, prevent urinary
          incontinence and other women’s concerns, prepare for and recover from
          childbirth, release emotional trauma, boost confidence, and enhance
          vital energies <br /><br />• Reveals the properties and benefits of 12
          different stone eggs along with guidelines for choosing the egg that
          will work best for you <br /><br />• Includes contributions from
          Taoist and tantric master teachers, including Mantak Chia, Minke de
          Vos, Aisha Sieburth, Jutta Kellen-Shepherd, Sarina Stone, Shashi
          Solluna, and Jose Toiràn, as well as testimonials from women of all
          ages <br /><br />Used for thousands of years throughout Asia,
          including by the royal concubines of the Chinese emperors, yoni eggs
          are egg-shaped stones used internally to help tone the pelvic floor
          and vaginal muscles as well as increase sensitivity, enhance intimate
          awareness, release emotional traumas, and open access to the sacred
          feminine within. <br /><br />In this full-color step-by-step guide,
          Lilou Macé details the techniques and rituals of yoni egg practice,
          aiming to dispel fears and reservations about its use and reveal its
          profound benefits for body, mind, and spirit. She explains how the
          yoni is not merely a body part, but the portal to greater wisdom and
          self-knowledge--your temple of the sacred feminine. Providing an
          anatomical guide to the yoni, she shows how it contains reflexology
          points and energy meridians that can be worked with through different
          placements of the yoni egg. She offers detailed instructions for yoni
          egg exercises, including how to use a yoni egg for the first time, and
          explores how these techniques can help you have more intense orgasms,
          prevent urinary incontinence and other women’s health issues, prepare
          for and recover from childbirth, release trauma and negative emotions
          trapped within your body, boost your confidence and femininity, and
          unlock access to your inner source of creativity and wisdom.
          <br /><br />The author explores the properties and healing benefits of
          12 different gemstone eggs, from the well-known jade egg to
          lesser-known eggs such as amethyst, obsidian, and green aventurine,
          along with guidelines for choosing the stone type and egg size that
          will work best for you. Concluding with rituals for initiating
          yourself into the power of your yoni and for releasing the sacred
          feminine within, the author shows how each of us has the power to
          heal, to be kind to ourselves, and to reveal our own inner beauty and
          wisdom.
