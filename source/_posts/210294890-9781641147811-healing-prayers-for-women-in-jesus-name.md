            This book, Healing Prayers for Women in Jesus' Name, was written to
            let women know how much they are loved by God. After retiring from
            teaching young children, Gail and her mama, Ms. Jean spent over five
            years together worshiping God, reading the Bible and singing hymns
            together. Gail's dear mama became ill, and the doctors were not sure
            she would make it. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance, and
            they almost lost her. Four days later, she awoke in her hospital
            room smiling, and telling Gail that she had been with Jesus. Mrs.
            Jean was so excited, and Gail truly believed her. Gail's mama told
            her that she went to Heaven and talked to Jesus. He asked Ms. Jean
            if she would come back and help encourage her daughter to finish
            this women's book. She saw her loved ones, held her precious
            granddaughter she longed to hold, and agreed to come back, so that
            Gods will for them would be done! Even though Jean passed away on
            August 3, 2016, Gail promised her she would do what Jesus told her
            to do. Thanks to Faith Christian Publishing Company, mama's heart,
            this book will be shared with many women. Mrs. Gail is so humbled by
            this book and prays it will touch women's lives everywhere. It is
            also Ms. Jean's heart and legacy! May God bless this book for women!
            Gail adds, "I learned so much during this time with Mama. I learned
            to be humble, more patient, and to stop complaining. I also learned
            that God's timing is always the best, and he will never lead you to
            do something for Jesus, without equipping you to do his will. Many
            human angels have touched our lives and we pray that they will be
            blessed. Our prayer for you is that you will receive a special
            blessing from this book and appreciate God's beautiful nature. We
            also pray that you will receive his salvation through grace, and
            worship him each day. He made you and he loves you just the way you
            are. We also pray that you will receive a special blessing from the
            Lord, and we pray you will be drawn closer to your Heavenly Father.
            Be blessed, dear woman. Jesus loves you! Your faith will make you
            whole!"
