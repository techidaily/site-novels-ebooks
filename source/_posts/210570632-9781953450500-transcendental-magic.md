            Transcendental Magic: Its Doctrine and Ritual by Éliphas Lévi
            explores magic, the "esoteric science," and its place between
            science and religion.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Born Alphonse Louis Constant in 1810, this French occultist
            originally planned for a career in the Catholic Church. Constant was
            educated at Saint Sulpice's seminary, and planned to become a
            priest. Yet just before he was to receive his ordination at age 26,
            Constant renounced his ecclesiastical goals and returned to civilian
            life.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The following years tested Constant's conscience and resilience. He
            was disowned by his family, and worked as a tutor to earn an income.
            Without the structure from the seminary, he found himself adrift.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Constant dedicated much of his early life to promoting the ideals of
            a utopian socialist society that worked for the economic improvement
            of all people. He shared these ideas in an early work called The
            Bible of Liberty. Within an hour of its release, the copies were
            seized by French authorities, and Constant spent the next six months
            in prison.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            After a failed marriage and the death of his young daughter,
            Constant discovered the world of the occult and mysticism. He became
            a ceremonial magician, and developed a social circle of many of the
            occultists and Kabbalists of the time. Writing on the subject under
            the Hebrew name Éliphas Lévi, he began to share his ideas on magic
            with the public in the 1850s.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Lévi's first published book on ritual magic is the two-part work,
            Transcendental Magic: Its Doctrines and Rituals. The two parts were
            first published as single work with a thorough biographical
            introduction in 1958.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This work explores the magician's foundations for his spiritual
            beliefs, as well as his idea that an elite class of priests would be
            necessary to lead the people into both social and magical order. He
            writes, "Occult philosophy seems to have been the nurse and
            godmother of all intellectual forces, the key of all divine
            obscurities, and the absolute mistress of society, in those ages
            when it was exclusively reserved for the education of priests and of
            kings...Magic is the traditional science of the secrets of Nature
            which comes to us from the Magi."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Part One, The Doctrine of Transcendental Magic, was first published
            in 1854. This work establishes the concepts behind symbols like the
            tetragram and pentagram, the significance of Hebrew letters and
            numbers, and the relationship between science, occultism, and formal
            religion. Lévi was the first to document the meaning of the points
            of the pentagram. He stated that a pentagram with only one point up
            and two down is a symbol of the Savior, and a pentagram with two
            points up and one down is a "symbol of evil and attracts sinister
            forces."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Part Two, The Rituals of Transcendental Magic, was published in
            1856. It discusses the actual materials, processes, and settings for
            conducting ritual magic. The practitioner must purify himself
            through a temperate diet, regular sleep, and thorough attention to
            cleaning and hygiene.&nbsp;A complete description of tools like a
            magical lamp, rod, sword, and dagger follows, leaving the magician
            well equipped to perform ceremonies and rituals. Lévi also added the
            Tarot to the tools of the magician, which was a new development in
            the occultism of the time.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Although Lévi didn't enjoy much notoriety during his life, his works
            eventually became highly influential among other occultists, and he
            is now considered one of the fathers of modern mysticism. Famous
            occultist Aleister Crowley even claimed to be Lévi himself in one of
            his past lives. Additionally, Arthur Edward Waite and Pamela Colman
            Smith created the Waite-Smith deck based on Éliphas Lévi's writings,
            which is the basis for most modern Tarot decks.
