          <br />
          Through her work with thousands of people, Corin Grillo has discovered
          a form of creative magic that is both accessible and effective. In
          Angel Wealth Magic, she speaks to anyone looking for solutions to grow
          a bank account, manifest an entrepreneurial dream, or create the home
          life they crave.<br />
          <br />
          All we need to do is call upon the divine intervention that is ready
          and able to help us fulfill our financial and best-life dreams. Along
          the way, Corin teaches us how to detox from self-defeating notions of
          lack, unworthiness, and personal or familial shame. Through simple
          practices, rituals, and everyday mindset shifts, she shows us how to
          be the happy, healthy, and truly fulfilled people we were meant to
          be.<br />
