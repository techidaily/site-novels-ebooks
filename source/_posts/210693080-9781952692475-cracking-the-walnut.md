            >Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh's commentary on Nagarjuna's Treatise on
            the Middle Way, one of the most famous Buddhist texts in
            existence</b
          ><br /><br />Nagarjuna is a giant in the Buddhist canon, thought to be
          the greatest Buddhist philosopher after the Buddha. He lived in
          southern India in the 2nd century CE.<br /><i>Cracking the Walnut</i>
          contains the text of Nagarjuna’s Treatise on the Middle Way
          (Mulamadhyamakakarika), defending the essential premise that all
          things have the nature of emptiness, they have no self-nature, but are
          in a constant process of change and interrelationship with one
          another.<br />Weaving&nbsp;Nagarjuna’s text with commentary by Thich
          Nhat Hanh, taken from talks given at two 3-month-long
          retreats,&nbsp;helps us bring these teachings into our daily life.
          They are strong teachings, designed to break through all metaphysical
          speculation. To a greater or lesser extent, we all have notions and
          ideas about life. Sometimes our ideas can contribute to the
          advancement of humanity, but the problem comes when we are caught in
          our ideas and believe them to be the absolute truth. When people
          believe that something is the absolute truth, they may be ready to
          fight, kill, or die for it. This brings about polarization, deep
          division, and suffering in ourselves, our society, community, and
          family. This is not the way ahead for humanity. This book helps us let
          go of our ideas and go in the direction of understanding and
          compassion.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Thich Nhat Hanh was a world-renowned spiritual teacher and peace
          activist. Born in Vietnam in 1926, he became a Zen Buddhist monk at
          the age of sixteen. Over seven decades of teaching, he published more
          than 100 books, which have sold more than four million copies in the
          United States alone. Exiled from Vietnam in 1966 for promoting peace,
          his teachings on Buddhism as a path to social and political
          transformation are responsible for bringing the mindfulness movement
          to Western culture. He established the international Plum Village
          Community of Engaged Buddhism in France, now the largest Buddhist
          monastery in Europe and the heart of a growing community of
          mindfulness practice centers around the world. He passed away in 2022
          at the age of 95 at his root temple, Tu Hieu, in Hue, Vietnam.<br /><b

          >
          (Chan Duc, True Virtue) was born in England and studied Classics and
          Sanskrit. In 1988, in India, she became the first European person to
          be ordained as a monastic by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh.
