          Richard Gordon maps out new territory in the rarely explored
          intersection of science and spirituality in this
          fascinating&nbsp;investigation of the profound relationship between
          matter and consciousness. Building on the Quantum-Touch technique he
          developed in previous books, Gordon explains how the hands-on energy
          healing technique that he uses to help to alleviate nerve pain,
          headaches, back pain, hip pain, TMJ, and more provides a unique window
          onto the secret nature of matter. He explains how, by examining pelvic
          and occipital torsion, and then aligning people without the use of
          touch or suggestion, he is able to run a wide range of simple
          experiments that challenge many dogmas of science. This book teaches
          readers the technique along with 57 easy-to-reproduce experiments that
          allow them to test the results. These experiments clearly demonstrate
          that our consciousness can profoundly influence matter, and that an
          object charged with energy and intent can dramatically affect us
          physiologically in seconds.

          “Richard Gordon’s <i>The Secret Nature of Matter </i>is a gift to all
          those who have asked the question, “What is the reality of existence?”
          Readers, prepare yourselves to expand beyond any cherished beliefs you
          currently hold about the scientific and spiritual laws governing the
          universe and how you may apply them to unveiling the mysteries that
          permeate our seemingly ordinary, everyday lives. Read this book. Then
          read it again, allowing the beauty of its liberating wisdom free your
          spirit.” <br />—Michael Bernard Beckwith, author of
          <i>Spiritual Liberation and Life Visioning</i> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “It is a delightful read to follow Richard Gordon as he experimentally
          discovers that consciousness is fundamental, that an intent infused
          with love serves as the organizing principle of consciousness, and
          that our so called “physical” reality is a virtual reality computed by
          the Larger Consciousness System. Better yet, Gordon’s process provides
          a scientific evidential path that allows scientists and laymen alike
          to unequivocally experience for themselves ancient wisdom and
          spiritual truths that reduce materialism to an irrational belief. What
          could be more useful and significant than that?” <br />
          &nbsp;—Thomas Campbell, physicist and author of
          <i>My Big TOE</i> (Theory of Everything)<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Richard Gordon presents many convincing phenomena demonstrating that
          our consciousness affects the world around us. He shows the limits of
          materialistic thinking by outlining the paradoxes of quantum physics.
          In the “double slit” experiments, the presence of the consciousness of
          an observer changes the behavior of atomic particles. With infectious
          childlike curiosity, he then reports on a series of personal
          experiments. He charges objects like coins with healing intent, and
          finds that these are later able to produce postural alignment in
          others. Told with a warm and enthusiastic tone, Gordon provides
          mind-bending evidence that holds profound implications for the domains
          of science and of healing. He shows how we can use these gifts to heal
          our own bodies and those of the people around us, and by changing our
          subjective consciousness, change the objective world. This practical
          and provocative book is of great interest to professionals as well as
          anyone seeking optimal wellness.” <br />
          &nbsp;—Dawson Church, PhD, award-winning author of
          <i>The Genie in Your Genes</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Once in a great while, someone comes along and challenges the status
          quo and all that we know to be true. Inspiring and inviting us to open
          our minds and to become pioneers in new ways of seeing and thinking
          about our reality. Richard Gordon is one such person. In
          <i>The Secret Nature of Matter</i>, Richard Gordon takes us on a
          fascinating journey, pointing out new ways to experience matter and
          our very own consciousness. He brings a significant contribution to
          many unanswered questions about energy healing, offering key teachings
          and deep insights about the role of consciousness in the quantum
          world. I am particularly excited about conscious entanglement and the
          new laws of matter and look forward to the momentous shift they will
          bring to the world.” <br />
          —Marie Mbouni, MD, #1 bestselling author of
          <i>Reclaiming Your Gifts: A Guide to </i><br />
          <i>Awakening Your Purpose <br /></i><br />
          “This groundbreaking and thought-provoking book challenges scientific
          dogma about how reality works by systematically examining how matter
          responds to consciousness and the importance of entanglement. Gordon’s
          brilliant exploration of how his Quantum-Touch technique can create a
          spontaneous postural alignment is a demonstration of real magic, a
          seminal contribution that builds a bridge between science and
          spirituality. Gordon teaches everyone how to replicate his experiments
          that have empirical and undeniable results. He encourages everyone to
          join his journey of discovery—a do it yourself paradigm shift.” <br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          Richard Gordon is recognized as one of the pioneers in the field of
          energy healing. He has been developing new healing techniques that are
          powerful yet simple and easy to learn, teaching them in workshops
          worldwide, and making them accessible to everyone in books since the
          mid-1970s. Today, as the founder of Quantum-Touch, Richard is an
          internationally acclaimed speaker at conferences, medical centers,
          chiropractic colleges, and holistic health institutes. He has been on
          faculty at Heartwood Institute and The Holistic Health Institute. His
          worldwide Quantum-Touch workshops sell out quickly, and his original
          Quantum-Touch video workshop is now available online at
          QuantumTouch.com. He actively posts videos of amazing Quantum-Touch
          healing stories and demonstrations on the YouTube/QuantumTouch
          channel.
