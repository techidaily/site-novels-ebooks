            forms, entities and beings inhabiting our universe.

          <p>
            Building on their decades of research into the paranormal, mystical,
            and supernatural, the Steigers analyze the influences and theories
            behind these mysterious “visitors,” whether they appear as aliens,
            ghosts, spirits, angels, demons, monsters, or some other form. The
            visitors have been called metaterrestrial, extradimensional,
            interdimensional, ultraterrestrial, and supraphysical intelligences,
            but regardless of the label, these inscrutable existences have left
            their mark on the people they've met—and a host of weird, wondrous,
            and horrifying stories. There are more than 200 thought-provoking
            stories that make you wonder about the Truth, including ...<i
