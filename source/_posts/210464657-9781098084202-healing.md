          <p>
            Have you ever been in a place in your life where you needed the Lord
            to heal you and you knew that he was the only one who could, yet you
            doubted? Have you prayed and prayed and felt like your prayers were
            not being heard? Do you need a mighty move of God in your life? Then
            this book, Healing: The Children's Bread Journal, is your answer. It
            is full of the Word of God, affirmations based on the Word of God,
            prayers, and testimonies that will work together for your good. The
            Lord is waiting for you to put your trust in him.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            One testimony says, "Reading the scriptures has given me a sense of
            peace in knowing that everything will be okay... As I was reading
            the confession of faith, I felt like God was speaking to me,
            touching me, and acknowledging my pain... I felt free, rejuvenated.
            I felt like I could run for miles. I learned that day that all I
            have to do is believe in his Word and keep God close."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Another testimony says, "The healing scriptures within this book
            were encouraging and comforting, coupled with faith... I shared the
            scriptures and prayer with a former coworker who was facing a cancer
            diagnosis. God miraculously moved on her behalf, and all of her lab
            results came out negative." I have the same testimony, praise God.
            To God be all the glory for his marvelous, wondrous works!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Reciting scriptures like, "Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed;
            save me, and I shall be saved, for you are my praise" (Jeremiah
            17:14) and "I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the
            Lord" (Psalm 118:17), combined with prayers and daily affirmations,
            these will bring you to a place of healing that only the Lord can
            perform.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            "Father God, in the name of Jesus, you are Jehovah-Rapha, our
            healer. I connect my faith with whomever is reading this and agree
            with them for their healing to manifest. We know that it is our
            covenant right to walk in healing. Jesus, our Savior, bore stripes
            so that we could walk in divine healing and health, and I command it
            to come forth and manifest in Jesus's name. Father, we trust you and
            know that you will do this for us. We bind the attack of the
            enemy--he has no power, he is a defeated foe. We loose healing in
            Jesus's name. We speak life now in Jesus's name. Amen."
