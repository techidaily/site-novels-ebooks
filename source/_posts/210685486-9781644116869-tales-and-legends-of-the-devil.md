          ><br /><br />• Draws on folk traditions from all over Europe,

          gods<br /><br />The devil has many more guises than the cliché red
          boogeyman named Lucifer or Satan who haunts Christianity. In some
          traditions the devil is sinister and cunning, while others portray him
          as an oaf who can easily be conned and evaded by anyone with an ounce
          of cleverness. In other tales and legends, he is the primal
          shapeshifter, and the Roma, also known as the gypsies, claimed his
          talents of metamorphosis were so strong he could even assume the
          appearance of a priest. <br /><br />Drawing on folk traditions from
          all over Europe, including Transylvanian Romania, Bulgaria, Albania,
          Switzerland, Italy, France, Scandinavia, Moravia, Bohemia, Lapland,
          and the Baltic countries, Claude and Corinne Lecouteux explore the
          many forms and abilities of the devil in stories, tales, and legends
          throughout the ages. They trace the devil’s shapeshifting powers back
          to their Vedic origins in ancient India and look at his connections
          with witches, storm magic, and other magical events. They examine the
          symbolic implications of the appearance of the devil in these tales,
          such as how he is often either limping or disfigured with the legs or
          feet of a goat or other animals traditionally linked to the lower
          powers or passions. They explain how the devil’s limp or his goat-like
          feet reflect the prevalence in world mythology of the sacred nature of
          crippling injuries. <br /><br />Peeling back the Christian veneer
          embedded in many tales and legends about the so-called Evil One, the
          authors ultimately reveal how many of the qualities and magical powers
          attributed to the devil were once those belonging to pagan gods, like
          the Lithuanian thunder god Perkūnas or the Titan Chronos, as well as
          to playful woodland spirits and the sometimes helpful, sometimes
          fearful fauns and satyrs of Greco-Roman mythology.

          “In their majestic collection of folk stories about Satan, authors and
          curators Claude and Corinne Lecouteux unearth a truth that our culture
          translates into myth: we as a human community remain deeply
          affectionate toward our old gods. What in cinema is called Loki, Darth
          Vader, and Maleficent are the same archetypes that populate these
          Old-World legends in which our forebears were brave enough to call
          their antihero by his name. With the very able hand of translator Jon
          E. Graham, the Lecouteuxs have created a forbidden feast.”
