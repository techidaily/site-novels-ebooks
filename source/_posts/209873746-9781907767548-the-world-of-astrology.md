          Sleeve Notes from Brazilian EditionWe see in the present century,
          after its relative decline in European societies in the seventeenth
          century, a return of astrology in modern urban centres, where the
          number of astrological consultants increases and the newspapers
          publish 'horoscopes' with predictions for the natives of each Sun
          sign. Astrology, the ancient divinatory system which has been
          experiencing growing popularity in large Brazilian cities in recent
          years, has rarely received attention in the social sciences.This book
          analyses the beliefs and cultural constructions of their world in a
          group of individuals belonging to the middle classes in Rio and
          involved in the use of astrology. By means of research and interviews,
          the author, approaching the urban middle classes, takes the following
          question as his hypothesis: to what extent can we say that astrology
          contributes to the construction of [a] particular lifestyle?The author
          begins his analysis from the main principles of the symbolic system of
          astrology and its divinatory practice, attempting to show that, in the
          same way as the structure of myth investigated by Lévi-Strauss, the
          structure of this system remains constant across its various versions.
          Despite this stability throughout its history, it is capable of
          receiving several different social appropriations. In the case of
          interest here, it is the appropriation made of it among sectors of the
          urban middle class in Rio de Janeiro, for whom psychotherapy is
          already an influence, and whose views are analysed in detail in the
          last chapter. Relating itself to varying degrees with psychoanalysis
          and religion, astrology shows itself to be a symbolic language capable
          of engaging the fragmentation of modern daily life. Thus it becomes
          clear that this little-known phenomenon of contemporary culture cannot
          be reduced to a mere irrational survival. This book is an original
          contribution to the study of the middle classes in Brazil, and of
          astrology as an "alternative culture", an area little studied by the
          social sciences. In addition to discussing the classics and more
          recent anthropological works on the subject, the author examines the
          ambiguous relation which modernity has with astrology: 'arising in its
          very heart, it presents a discourse marked by criticism of the values
          of modernity'.Complementing this volume, the reader will find a
          glossary explaining astrological terms in Appendix 2.About the
          AuthorLuis Rodolfo da Paixão Vilhena took his Master's degree in
          Social Anthropology in the Postgraduate Programme in Social
          Anthropology of the National Museum (Federal University of Rio de
          Janeiro, UFRJ). He was a researcher at the National Institute of
          Folklore (FUNARTE), 1988-1989, where he studied the history of
          Folklore Studies in Brazil and was a lecturer at UERJ and of the
          Faculty Veiga de Almeida. He died in 1997.
