          <p>
            This book is an account of the personal and collective struggles of
            First Nations people and how the principles which held traditional
            societies together can be used today to promote harmonious and
            cooperative relationships by both aboriginals and non-aboriginals.
            Calvin Morrisseau provides in it the fundamentals for healing that
            he has learned over twenty years through his training in counselling
            and addiction studies; his education in traditional practices by
            aboriginal elders, healers, and teachers; and his personal recovery
            from alcoholism, drug addiction, abuse, and the effects of
            assimilation, racism and poverty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The model of healing Morrisseau advocates is simple, insightful, and
            based on the values that allowed aboriginal people to live in accord
            with each other in the past. His approach centres on people
            accepting responsibility and making choices that give them the
            freedom required to enter into recovery by recapturing their sense
            of harmony, cooperation, sharing, balance and spirituality. The
            deepest healing takes place on a spiritual level. Morrisseau
            describes an interdependent system of individual, family, and
            community in which needs, desires, values, and purpose are
            communicated, and the responsibility to ensure everyone has an
            opportunity to grow to their full potential is shared. The book is
            unique in that it offers guidance on ways in which communities can
            heal.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the book was written for people who work with aboriginal
            people, the wholistic approach Morrisseau uses can benefit anyone.
            The healing model can be used by an individual seeking to heal
            himself, by a professional as a tool for assessment and treatment,
            and by a community in crisis.

          'Morrisseau's story of self-abuse and self-redemption is an inspiring
          one. The book ... is a gift of healing to others ... By going back and
          dealing with his childhood trauma - his sense of betrayal and
          abandonment - Morrisseau found the insights necessary to help others.'
