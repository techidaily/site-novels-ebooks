          <p><strong>Landmark Articles in Near-Death Research</strong></p>
          <p>
            This volume is the first of a new book series that draws on landmark
            articles published in the Journal of Near-Death Studies (JNDS) to
            provide an overview of the past four decades of basic research
            within the field of near-death studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The anthology of which this volume is part covers the broad spectrum
            of scientific and academic work published by the International
            Association for Near-Death Studies (IANDS) and addresses, arguably,
            some of the most pressing and relevant questions on the nature of
            near-death experiences (NDEs). By presenting research over the past
            nearly forty years, this book also offers insights into the history
            and foundation of ideas within near-death research.
          </p>
          <p>
            This volume provides a systematic overview—a map—of what scholars
            have achieved so far within conceptual and phenomenological research
            in the field. It identifies how nearly forgotten or neglected
            earlier research trends might inspire and enrich current research
            and points toward areas still left to be covered. The focus of the
            chapters moves consecutively from articles on epistemology—How do we
            approach the phenomenon of NDEs?, to phenomenology—What is the
            experience of an NDE like?, to ontology—What are NDEs, and who has
            them?, and, finally, to the wider implications—What do NDEs really
            mean?.

            For all serious students and scholars interested in the field of
            near-death studies, this collection of some of the most important
            articles published in the Journal of Near-Death Studies over the
            last nearly forty years is a must — an indispensable and invaluable
            resource. Of particular value is the brilliant and incisive
            historical overview of the field by the editor of this volume,
            Alexander Batthyány.<br />--

            This wonderful book offers a great opportunity, not only for
            scientists, philosophers, psychologists and physicians, but also for
            near-death experiencers and the public, to have a better
            understanding of the implications and results of NDE research.<br />--

            This incredibly insightful book is long overdue. The ground-breaking
            articles presented in this volume informed how future near-death
            research was conducted and enabled refinement of methods. A ‘must

            A landmark collection of seminal studies that will be invaluable to
