          A comprehensive handbook of more than 1,000 magical words, phrases,
          symbols, and secret alphabets <br />
          <br />• Explains the origins, derivatives, and practical usage of each
          word, phrase, and spell as well as how they can be combined for custom
          spells <br />
          <br />• Based on the magical traditions of Europe, Greece, and Egypt
          and recently discovered one-of-a-kind grimoires from Scandinavia,
          France, and Germany <br />
          <br />• Includes an in-depth exploration of secret magical alphabets,
          including those based on Hebrew letters, Kabbalistic symbols,
          astrological signs, and runes <br />
          <br />From <i>Abracadabra </i>to the now famous spells of the Harry
          Potter series, magic words are no longer confined to the practices of
          pagans, alchemists, witches, and occultists. They have become part of
          the popular imagination of the Western world. Passed down from ancient
          Babylon, Egypt, and Greece, these words and the rituals surrounding
          them have survived through the millennia because they work. And as
          scholar Claude Lecouteux reveals, often the more impenetrable they
          seem, the more effective they are. <br />
          <br />Analyzing more than 7,000 spells from the magical traditions of
          Europe as well as the magical papyri of the Greeks and recently
          discovered one-of-a-kind grimoires from Scandinavia, France, and
          Germany, Lecouteux has compiled a comprehensive dictionary of ancient
          magic words, phrases, and spells along with an in-depth
          exploration--the first in English--of secret magical alphabets,
          including those based on Hebrew letters, Kabbalistic symbols,
          astrological signs, and runes. Drawing upon thousands of medieval
          accounts and famous manuscripts such as the Heptameron of Peter Abano,
          the author examines the origins of each word or spell, offering
          detailed instructions on their successful use, whether for protection,
          love, wealth, or healing. He charts their evolution and derivations
          through the centuries, showing, for example, how spells that were once
          intended to put out fires evolved to protect people from witchcraft.
          He reveals the inherent versatility of magic words and how each
          sorcerer or witch had a set of stock phrases they would combine to
          build a custom spell for the magical need at hand. <br />
          <br />Presenting a wealth of material on magical words, signs, and
          charms, both common and obscure, Lecouteux also explores the magical
          words and spells of ancient Scandinavia, the Hispano-Arabic magic of
          Spain before the Reconquista, the traditions passed down from ancient
          Egypt, and those that have stayed in use until the present day.
