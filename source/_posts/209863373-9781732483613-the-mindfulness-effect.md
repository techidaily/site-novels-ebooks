            How can mindfulness change your life, and your impact on the world?
            In addition to challenging and dismantling systemic inequalities we
            are facing globally, we must also reflect on ourselves, our life’s
            purpose, and the effect our social identities have on us and on
            others. Unpacking our social conditioning and the systemic
            inequalities that frame society allows us to discover what might be
            keeping us from fulfilling our life’s potential and from deeply
            connecting with others. Building authentic relationships across
            cultural differences is an antidote to social injustice, provides us
            with a sense of belonging, and paves the way for a richer, more
            rewarding life. Offering 25 mindfulness practices and activities,
            The Mindfulness Effect provides specific strategies for healing,
            empowerment, and social justice so that we can live our lives fully
            and freely, with intention, connection, excellence, innovation, and
            meaning.

          “Dr. Dena Samuels teaches with radical authenticity, courageous
          vulnerability, and deep wisdom. The Mindfulness Effect is a rich and
          practical manual for personal and collective healing, empowerment, and
          profound social justice.”

          “The Mindfulness Effect has changed how I interact with the world and
          myself. I love how immediate and interactive it is! I’ve been unsure
          how to meditate in the past, I felt like I wasn’t doing it right. I
          had no idea that meditation/mindfulness was so useful in self-healing.
          The practices really pulled me in and I ended up writing a meditation
          journal which was a useful tool of introspection. I see so much more
          clearly how mindfulness can help me lead a happy and more meaningful
          life. A life that I’m choosing. Also, the way the book seamlessly
          connected mindfulness and social justice changed my whole schematic. I
          wouldn’t have thought of the connection before, but now I don’t know
          how we would even try to resolve social justice issues without
          mindfulness and self-healing. Teaching people mindfulness helps them
          see their own biases and can soften their views on those who are
          different than themselves.”

          “So much wisdom and caring is felt in these words and the simplicity
          with which the information about mindfulness is related is easy and
          inspiring to receive. Samuels’ storytelling is an integral part of
          diving into the material, as it demonstrates the ideas and concepts in
          experiential form. As a kinetic learner, that helps me a lot. It also
          brings a rich creative hand to the book, moving it from instructional
          to “felt.” … Samuels brings a most heart-satisfying, wholeness and
          healing gift to the world”

          “So much to absorb and ponder. Thank you for this wonderful book! It’s
          such a wise and also humble offering.”

          “This beautifully written and insightful book helps me understand more
          and more clearly that through mindfulness, meditation and decluttering
          practices, I am happier, healthier, more connected, more awake and
          conscious and aware. The practices Dr. Samuels encourages her readers
          to engage with are a journey toward personal freedom that also enables
          me/us to be of better service for social and environmental justice
          work.” <strong>~ KRISTEN SUTTLES, writer</strong>
