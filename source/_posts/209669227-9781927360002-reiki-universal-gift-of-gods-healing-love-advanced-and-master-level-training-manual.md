          After eighteen years as a practitioner and teacher of Reiki, Sister
          Eileen has been astonished by the sheer number of people who have
          continued to stream through the door. People of all ages and
          traditions have come seeking their healing and finding it as Eileen
          did when she first embarked on this foreign road that soon became home
          to her. Eileen has come to recognize through her many years of
          practice that there is an inherent healing power within each of us and
          that the gift of Reiki is able to activate it. In her manual, Eileen
          brings with her a core community of Reiki practitioners and teachers
          from different traditions and backgrounds that journey alongside her
          and recognize, as she does, the simplicity, wonder and beauty of God’s
          universal gift for our time. The healing stories are too numerous to
          count but she does include specific testimonials within her manual
          that speak for the thousands of others who have been healed through
          the doorway of Reiki. In this way, Eileen’s Advanced and Master Level
          Training Manual, becomes a living testimony as she thoroughly covers
          all the information required to be a successful and competent Reiki
          practitioner and teacher. Written with inspiration and clarity, Eileen
          takes the reader on an amazing journey into the dynamic world of the
          inner self. Like a fresh current of air, she presents her material in
          an appealing and easily digestible manner. The uniqueness of Eileen’s
          Reiki training manual lies in her ability to weave the Christ
          conscious healing dimension into it just as an alchemist would when
          producing gold. In this way, Eileen shows how the revered eastern
          practice of Reiki discovered by Dr. Mikao Usui, a Japanese Buddhist,
          in the early 20th century can blend perfectly with a Christian
          heritage of healing where the one enhances the other. At the same
          time, she shows how this simple, profound method of hands-on healing
          transcends cultural and religious boundaries in a way that makes this
          universal gift of Life Force Energy accessible to anyone. Often people
          who encounter Reiki for the first time experience an inner bliss and
          harmony which leads them to explore the gift more fully. Others go
          away from the treatment or training feeling restored, refreshed and
          renewed. Reiki, the universal Life Force Energy of God, is not a new
          invention or modern day fad. Its roots are planted deep in ancient
          history. In the Old Testament, Life Force Energy was spoken about
          eloquently and has been pulsating through the whole of creation from
          the beginning of time. Even science and the world of medicine are
          looking at this complementary form of healing called “Reiki” with
          fresh new eyes. Its worldwide impact can no longer go unnoticed. About
          the Author: Eileen Curteis, a Sister of Saint Ann, is a Reiki Master
          teacher and practitioner, who has taught and treated thousands of
          people over the last eighteen years at Queenswood, a former retreat
          and spirituality centre in Victoria, BC. Preceding this, Eileen was a
          teacher, principal and educator for twenty-seven years. Her greatest
          passion lies in her healing ministry and in the literary arts. She has
          authored eleven books to date and through the years has become an
          accomplished poet, artist, writer, as well as being a producer of six
          CDs and three films.
