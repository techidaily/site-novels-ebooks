              >This comprehensive workbook sets the stage as a 'Hero's Journey'
              with the Hero embarking on a discovery of recognizing anxiety,
              coping with it, and ultimately finding freedom and a new sense of
              'normal.' Five stages of discovery include New Beginnings, Tune
              In, Walk the Talk, Deep Dive and Whole Hearted You. Much like in
              professional therapy, the reader is able to peel back layers of
              their psyche in a series of stepping stones, within each discovery
              stage. Stepping stones are full of not only theory, in order to
              understand anxiety, but also a host of practical applications. For
              people with anxiety, the process unfolds one step at a time, going
              from the surface dimensions of their story to deeper causes that
              are often hidden. A wide array of strategies, techniques and
              worksheets support the process on a conscious level. At the same
              time, this workbook engages the subconscious as well. In this way,
              significant change and healing is not only attainable but also
              sustainable.</span

          <p>
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >The program begins with a preliminary 'Suiting Up' section that
              prepares the reader's mindset along with a contract with self - a
              basic structure for health and wellbeing. The 5 stage discovery
              journey then begins.</span

            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >In Discovery 1, New Beginnings, the reader is introduced to the
              stages of change and what to expect with the various stages. An
              orientation to the subconscious, neuroplasticity and the conscious
              mind helps lay the groundwork to understanding both parts of the
              dynamics of the brain. That also includes hidden truths and blocks
              that people resist. In Discovery 2, Tune In, anyone working
              through anxiety is shown various ways to pay attention to how
              anxiety affects his/her life. Topics include mindfulness,
              multi-generational family stories and the authentic self. This
              stage focuses on the punch and poor of being present. Discovery 3
              is the third stage of the Anxiety Therapy at Home: Dancing with
              Your Shadow program. Called Walk the Talk, it peels back another
              layer of the psyche as it focuses on practising with awareness and
              intention. Sabotage thinking, vibe care, and calming are all
              specific routes to managing the ongoing anxiety in daily life.
              This stage is all about, 'what are you practicing?' Discovery 4
              takes you deeper into the root cause of anxiety and stress in
              general. Indeed, it is called, Deep Dive. Here the reader explores
              the trauma capsule and Clinical Meridian Tapping, that works
              directly with the subconscious through the body. In addition, the
              stepping stone called Hero, Parts and Your Shadow introduces and
              works with the hidden and often resistant personality part that
              holds onto that person's trauma. This core part is able to then
              receive the long-awaited attention that it needs. Freedom awaits
              the Hero (reader) on the journey. In Discovery 5, the Hero is
              given more tools and strategies in integrating the various
              stepping stones in the whole program. This stage is called Whole
              Hearted You. It includes the stepping stones for digging deeply;
              anger management, forgiveness, and ritual. All are designed to
              round out a platform for wellness and balance in life, no matter
              what the reader encounters on his/her journey. Each discovery
              stage opens with an overview of the stepping stones to be
              presented. At the end of each stage, a stepping stone called
              review &amp; reflect, gives the reader an opportunity to integrate
              the learning of that stage.</span
