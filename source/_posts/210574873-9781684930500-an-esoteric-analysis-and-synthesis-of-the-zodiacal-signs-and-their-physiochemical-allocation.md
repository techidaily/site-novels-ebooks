            An Esoteric Analysis and Synthesis of the Zodiac Signs and their
            Pyshio-Chemical Allocations (1932) by Inez Eudora Perry is a work of
            astrology, homeopathy, and biochemistry that offers an explanation
            of the secrets of the universe and human health.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Inez Eudora Perry (b. 1871, d. 1961) was an American astrologer and
            colleague of the homeopath and physician George W. Carey. Dr. Carey
            was a pioneer in the field of biochemistry. He believed that the
            application of certain minerals, called cell-salts, could cure
            disease-causing mineral deficiencies. Through these cell-salts, Dr.
            Carey proposed that cellular equilibrium could be returned to the
            human body, eliminating symptoms and creating a health-full, vibrant
            human.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Dr. Carey believed that each person's being is the sum
            of the vibrations that were present in nature at the time of our
            birth. These vibrations are categorized into the signs of the
            zodiac. Each sign corresponds to a certain cell-salt, which is
            consumed by the body more quickly than the others. Supplementation
            of these diminished salts, then, is required to maintain health and
            well-being.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Ms. Perry was an adherent of Dr. Carey's work and his long-time
            collaborator. She edited and co-authored books with Dr. Carey, like
            God-Man: The Word Made Flesh and The Tree of Life. In 1923, Dr.
            Carey brought Ms. Perry on as a partner into his biochemical
            foundation, renamed The Carey-Perry School of The Chemistry of
            Life.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Many years before Dr. Carey and Ms. Perry's working relationship
            began, Dr. Carey published a booklet titled The Relation of the
            Mineral Salts of the Body to the Signs of the Zodiac. After Dr.
            Carey's death in 1924, Ms. Perry revisited this short theoretical
            work and wrote a much longer book to expound on the concepts
            presented in the booklet. The result was An Esoteric Analysis and
            Synthesis of the Zodiacal Signs and their Physiochemical
            Allocations, published alongside a reprint of The Relation of the
            Mineral Salts in 1932.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Ms. Perry expounds on Dr. Carey's ideas and provides thorough
            explanations of the changes of the seasons, signs of the zodiac,
            myths of the great civilizations, and the natural world-and how all
            of this relates to the biochemistry of the human body. Digging deep
            into the symbolism of religion and language, she thoroughly explores
            the nature of each zodiac sign and the practical uses of each
            cell-salt. By supplementing these deficient salts, we can restore
            equilibrium.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            A lack of potassium phosphate, for example, can lead to nervousness,
            headaches, hysteria, and even paralysis. Quoting Dr. Carey, Ms.
            Perry suggests that we, "'Let the overworked business man take it
            and go home good-tempered. Let the weary wife, nerves unstrung from
            attending to sick children or entertaining company, take it and note
            how quickly the equilibrium will be restored and calm and reason
            assert her throne.'"
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Foundational to this teaching is the concept of "body building." The
            incorrect way to apply this biochemistry is to only take the
            applicable salts when one is in physical distress, and then to cease
            when the symptoms are gone. By consistently adding the supplemental
            cell-salts to a "moderate diet of natural food, simply prepared," we
            keep our bodies nourished and free from disease.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Today, cell-salts, also called tissue salts, are still prescribed by
            homeopathic medicine&nbsp;practitioners.
