          As an avid reader of self help books, I can honestly say this one
          stands apart from the rest. Why? Well, it’s filled with powerful
          affirmations and meditations, but what makes this special is the
          author shares her real life experiences and then how she transcended
          them using her exercises. - M (Verified Amazon Purchaser)

          This is a quick read, but you will find yourself deep in contemplation
          throughout the chapters. I appreciate the format of the book too. Ms.
          Shaw weaves her own experiences throughout and ends each chapter with
          affirmations and useful tools to help individuals reflect on their
          experiences and beliefs. -Readernj (Verified Amazon Purchaser)

          I have been looking for ways to lift my spirit after a tough breakup.
          I started reading through the affirmations and have incorporated their
          use in my life. This book serves as a catalyst in my healing process.

          I thought this was very captivating and real; the author's personal
          experience combined with self awareness is key to growth and inner
          peace. I can identify with the self destructive thinking and
          maladaptive responses to obstacles. The acceptance and faith in ones
          higher power is Critical to truly be able to let go of negative
          automatic thoughts that does not serve a my growth. The author
          articulated clearly that her past experience are spiritual lessons. I
          felt like she was talking about my personal experience. -Laura
