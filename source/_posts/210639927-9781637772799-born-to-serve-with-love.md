          <p>
            The inspired writings from this book, have come from my faith in
            Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit of Truth! Since my enlightenment
            (spiritual epiphany) took place in a dark time in my life, while
            facing a lot of issues, many may doubt the inspiration that the Holy
            Spirit had on me or these writings; yet, it is very accurate and
            appropriate to give God all the Glory! Before I started these
            inspired writings, I had no peace or direction. Now the peace of the
            Lord has not left me, and I feel born again; a true spiritual
            rebirth, through faith in Christ Jesus! Most of these writings are
            inspired, with very little thinking involved. They come all of a
            sudden and I just write it out, as it comes! Actually trying to
            express it to the readers now, forms a challenge to me. Trying to
            explain a spiritual experience, is not an easy task; yet, it is a
            beautiful experience to go through! I have had the pleasure of
            sharing these writings all over the world and receiving positive
            reactions from many people! This book is a compilation of many
            writings over a 5 year period. The writings in this book consist of
            many virtues to live by, through faith in Christ Jesus; as well as
            sharing the love of Christ with the doubters and steadfast
            believers. Moreover, it is about becoming that which you seek in the
            world, so you search no more! The spiritual truth is, we never had
            so much, until we gave it all away! It's the paradoxical reward of
            giving! Furthermore, my hope in putting this book together, is to
            reach more people in all kinds of situations and bring light into
            darkness for those who suffer; as well as make a good day better for
            many through faith in Christ Jesus!
