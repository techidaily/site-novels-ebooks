          MaryAnn DiMarco has been communicating with the Other Side since she
          was 5 years old. As a psychic medium, intuitive counselor, and
          spiritual teacher, clients from all over the world have sought her out
          for both personal guidance and as a means to connect with their
          departed loved ones’ souls. Even so, DiMarco’s greatest gift is her
          ability to teach others how to connect to the universe themselves—and
          in a way that sets meaningful change in motion. Now, in her
          extraordinary first book, DiMarco shares her teachings for developing
          intuition that will enable you to control your life using three
          powerful steps:<br /><br /><b>Believe</b> is about recognizing and
          demonstrating a belief in a higher power, whether you refer to this
          powerful energy as God, Divine, Source, or another name.<br /><br /><b
            >Ask</b
          >
          teaches you how to pose the right questions to a personal team of
          angels, spirit guides, departed loved ones, and evolved souls who help
          you navigate life’s ups and downs. Their job is to love, lead, and
          protect you as you dream, plan, and move along your soul’s best
          path.<br /><br /><b>Act</b> is a powerful call to get off the
          meditation cushion and put one earthly foot in front of the other to
          create momentum and positive change.<br /><br />When you connect to
          your Universal Team’s wisdom and guidance using Believe, Ask, Act, you
          will raise your intuition and learn how to identify and remove the
          spiritual, emotional, and real-world obstacles that hold you back.<br /><br />It’s
          time to awaken. Pay attention. Understand your role on this planet and
          what the world has to offer. You’ve already signaled to the universe
          that you’re ready to trust, listen, and work to realize your greatest
          potential.
