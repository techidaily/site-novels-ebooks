          A practical handbook to the history, exercises, and techniques of
          German rune work <br /><br />• Explores the four traditional runic
          systems: the Older Futhark, the Anglo-Frisian Futhorc, the Younger
          Futhark, and the Armanic Futhork <br /><br />• Details powerful rune
          work techniques and exercises, including rune yoga and dance, runic
          hand gestures (mudras), rune singing (mantras), runic healing, runic
          tantra and sex magic, rune rituals, runic divination, and the runic
          theory of crystals <br /><br />• Examines the history of esoteric
          runology and the trailblazers of modern rune magic, including Guido
          von List, Friedrich Bernhard Marby, and Rudolf John Gorsleben
          <br /><br />Although the rune renaissance began blossoming in
          Anglo-American occult circles in the 1970s, the runes have been part
          of the occult revival in Germany since its beginning in the late 19th
          century, with roots that go back centuries further. Exploring the
          history of esoteric runology and the work of the trailblazers of
          modern rune magic, including Guido von List, Friedrich Bernhard Marby,
          and Rudolf John Gorsleben, author Edred Thorsson details the secret
          practices and runic systems of the German rune magicians, including
          techniques for using runes in unprecedented ways to draw power into
          your life. <br /><br />Thorsson explores all four of the traditional
          runic systems: the Older Futhark (24 runes), the Anglo-Frisian Futhorc
          (29-33 runes), the Younger Futhark (16 runes), and the Armanic Futhork
          (18 runes), developed by Guido von List. The author explains the
          similarities and differences between them as well as how they are all
          facets of the same underlying runic reality. He examines the early
          history and possible origins of runic symbols and systems, the
          renaissance of rune magic from 1919 to 1935, the effects of the Third
          Reich and Nazis on the runic revival, as well as the reemergence of
          German runology after World War II. <br /><br />Providing an extensive
          practical section, Thorsson details powerful runework techniques and
          exercises, including rune yoga and dance, runic hand gestures
          (mudras), rune singing (mantras), rune yodeling, runic healing, runic
          tantra and sex magic, group rites with runes, and two powerful methods
          of engaging transpersonal powers: the Ritual of the Ninth Night and
          the Ritual of the Grail Cup. He also explores runic divination, the
          runic theory of crystals, runic symbolism in medieval German
          buildings, and runic material from the documents of the Fraternitas
          Saturni, the Brotherhood of Saturn. <br /><br />By immersing yourself
          in the world of the runic pioneers and the practices they designed,
          you will emerge with a deeper understanding of runes as well as the
          magical world from which they emanate.

          “No form of the runes is more controversial--and misunderstood--than
          the Armanen runes, originally arranged and interpreted by Guido von
          List and later co-opted by the Nazis, who ignored and undermined their
          true intent and meaning. Edred Thorsson delves into this fascinating
          area of rune-work while demonstrating his skill as the foremost figure
          in speculative runology. He is a scholar-magician who can interpret
          these runes and the practices associated with them in their true
          context, and with a careful eye for the legitimate and relevant facts
          about their sometimes outré associations. Ever mindful that an
          effective neo-tradition must have deep roots in the true tradition,
          Thorsson places the Armanen runes in their proper place in relation to
          the three primary historic rows, while suggesting fascinating
          practices that lead to a true synthesis of the eternal mysteries
          behind these runic systems.”
