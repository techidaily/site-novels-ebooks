            ><i>The Sacred Promise</i> offers scientific proof of Spirit’s
            existence—be it the deceased, angels, or spirit guides—and shows
            Spirit’s willingness and promise to offer guidance and help with the
            challenges of day-to-day living.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Sacred Promise</i> brings us into the laboratory of
          scientist Dr. Gary Schwartz, where he establishes the existence of
          Spirit by its own Willful Intent—a proof of concept for deceased
          spirits. The author takes readers on a personal journey into the world
          of angels and spirits and reveals their existence and desire to help.
          <br /><br />Dr. Schwartz candidly discusses the challenges as well as
          the rewards of connecting with Spirit. He poses several important
          questions. What if our feelings of emptiness, loneliness,
          hopelessness, and meaninglessness are actually fostered by our belief
          in a “spiritless” Universe? What if our physical hunger is symptomatic
          of a greater spiritual hunger? What if Spirit is actually all around
          us, ready to fill us with energy, hope, and direction, if we are ready
          to ingest it? What if Spirit is like air and water, readily available
          for us to draw within; that is, if we choose to seek it?
          <br /><br /><i>Sacred Promise</i> shows how we can attune ourselves
          and receive this guidance from Spirit, which is all scientifically
          documented by Dr. Schwartz experiments and research. Prepare to
          suspend your beliefs about Spirit.

          “Gary Schwartz has been on a remarkable journey throughout his
          lifetime. His body of work is inspirational to me because his passion
          to bring science and spirit together is dominated by an empirical
          doctrine that is unimpeachable. His latest research as recounted in
          [<i>The Sacred Promise</i>] is likely to impress even the most diehard
          skeptic. I am proud to recommend this book and to heap as much praise
          as possible upon my friend, Gary Schwartz.” <br /><br />—Kelsey
