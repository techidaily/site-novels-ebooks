          Engage with the intelligence of nature to discover your unique role
          and deepen your spiritual path on Earth <br /><br />• Presents
          practical ways to rekindle your connection with nature and open up to
          plant consciousness as a way to enrich your spiritual path
          <br /><br />• Offers guidance on how to meet plant allies with wisdom
          teachings specific to you and your path <br /><br />• Provides over 40
          exercises, including shamanic journeys, as well as links to digital
          downloads for a shamanic drumming track and guided meditations
          <br /><br />As our lives become more absorbed in screen time rather
          than the great outdoors, it feels essential to open up our senses
          again to the riches of nature, reestablishing our connection with the
          heartbeat of the Earth. In this book, Fay Johnstone provides a road
          map for bridging the gap between plants and people, allowing our
          sacred relationship with the Green Kingdom to be restored.
          <br /><br />Fay shows how to confidently meet, explore, and build
          relationships with key plant allies to enjoy a more balanced
          connection with yourself and your environment. Sharing her passion for
          the plant world, she provides a practical guide to rekindling your
          connection with nature, opening up to plant consciousness as a way to
          enrich your path and weave the enchantment of nature back into your
          own life. She includes more than 40 simple, practical exercises and
          meditations to guide you on a heart-centered journey of transformation
          and commune with the environment, the seasons, the cycles of the moon,
          and the Earth Heart. Addressing plants as conscious beings we meet
          their spirit, while at the same time aligning with our own true nature
          and sense of purpose as a creature of this Earth. <br /><br />The book
          also introduces the shamanic practice of plant spirit healing,
          emphasizing that ceremony begins at home with our local plants, rather
          than with the famous plant healers of the Amazon. Guided meditations
          and shamanic journeys enable a deeper exploration and interaction with
          the spirit of plants for healing and support. The author offers
          practical advice on how to initiate a conversation with plants and
          meet a plant ally with wisdom teachings specific to you and your path.
          <br /><br />Whether you explore your back garden, office plants, or
          morning cup of tea, Fay reveals how to introduce the magic of plants
          into your daily routine and appreciate the important role plants play.
          Reaching out to interact with nature is a step forward not only on
          your personal journey to wholeness but also toward healing our Earth.
