          <i>Partnering with Nature</i> is a simple book with a powerful
          message: our connections to the natural environment— and ultimately,
          to ourselves—are crucial in today’s fragmented world. As each
          successive generation moves farther away from nature, the growing
          disconnect is expressed through physical as well as mental stress,
          from depression and fatigue in adults to attention disorders and
          obesity in children. The way we relate to nature helps define our
          place within it, and by awakening this natural, yet dormant connection
          to the environment around us, we can move beyond solitary stewardship
          and into partnership.<br /><br />In <i>Partnering with Nature</i>,
          Catriona MacGregor weaves together scientific and historical wisdom,
          spiritual insights, and inspiring stories that illuminate the energies
          that link humans, animals, and the natural world. Through observation
          and conscious practice, we can open up to the power of nature to
          transform our lives, uplift our spirits, and even to direct our bodies
          to a healthier potential. For everyone who has a sense of something
          missing, who wishes to make a difference in their world, who yearns to
          reclaim their sense of wonder and awe, or who struggles with their
          health or emotional balance—nature speaks to all who will listen.

          “I have been deeply impressed by Catriona MacGregor for many years.
          Her striking kinship with the animal world and her vision of the
          natural world are compelling and apparent when you are in her
          presence.&nbsp;Many people carefully copy native traditions, hoping
          for a shamanic experience. Catriona MacGregor is a shaman.<br />
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Catriona's book
          <b><i></i></b>is a gentle yet somehow startling book, a work
          of&nbsp;unsuspected beauty, and generously far-ranging in its scope,
          considering how much it encompasses. It is written with the clarity of
          one who is consciously living in the web of life and empowered by a
          unique and enduring vision.”<br />
