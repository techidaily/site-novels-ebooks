            >A delightfully fresh and irreverent take on living well, based not
            on changing you but on fully being you</strong
          ><br />
          <br />Have you ever wondered why you don’t feel empowered, sexy, and
          free? This refreshingly authentic book will help you recognize and
          release whatever energetic baggage is weighing you down, from
          difficult relationship dynamics to financial challenges to feeling a
          lack of clarity in purpose — it’s all here for you to discover. Author
          Jolie Dawn admits that the process won’t always be comfortable, but
          she promises and shows through her personal stories of addiction,
          family trauma, internalized sexual shame, and debilitating self-doubt
          that a fearless, bold life is possible. The daily practices and tools
          she offers come from her lived experience of successfully transforming
          her life from the inside out. You’ll discover the power to radiate
          your inner light, dare to be your truest self, and expand the heart of
          every human who witnesses your divine feminine essence.<br />

          “Jolie Dawn has the gift of writing; her words become ours. Her book
          guides you from immaturity to wisdom. Jolie’s is the voice of the big
          sister, elder, and mentor my youthful self always wished for to bring
          her home to self-comfort. There is nothing like a good book that
          paints the picture of a youthful broken woman transformed into a wise,
          enlightened one. May this book shorten your journey to the best parts
          of you.”<br />

          private coach and a big sister who empowers you to bloom into the best
          version of you. Jolie Dawn lets no one, as challenged as they might
          feel with their life’s circumstances, get stuck into thinking they
          don’t have the power to create their life with more abundance and joy.
          Read this book if you dare to unlock the magic you have within and to
          live your desires as your reality.”<br />

          must-have road map for the modern woman for how to embody the new
          paradigm for living a wildly successful, turned-on, and purposeful

          shifts and cried lots of tears even in the first few pages. I’m
          eternally grateful this book exists — for me and for women everywhere.
          Jolie, thank you for sharing your magic to inspire our own.”<br />
