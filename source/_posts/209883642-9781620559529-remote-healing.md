          A practical guide to the Sagi method of healing across space and time
          <br /><br />• Shows that we can interact with the Akashic information
          field to diagnose and treat illnesses nonlocally and that the effects
          are controllable and verifiable <br /><br />• Details techniques for
          diagnosing and transferring healing information at a distance, using
          geometric symbols to treat acute infections and reduce pain, and
          integrating information medicine with homeopathy and chakra therapy
          <br /><br />• Shares the author’s development of her method, including
          stories of successful remote healings and her interactions with
          pioneers such as Erich Körbler <br /><br />Remote healing is healing
          over space and time. Often called “nonlocal healing,” it is no longer
          a magical occurrence or a mysterious technique reserved for powerful
          shamans. Remote healing has moved from magic to science, and it can be
          learned. <br /><br />In this practical guide to the Sagi method of
          information medicine, Maria Sagi, Ph.D., reveals that nonlocal healing
          is a quantum science that works through the transmission of
          information and that its effects can be controlled and verified.
          Drawing on the Akashic information field of Ervin Laszlo, she explains
          that the universe is not a mechanical system composed of matter--it
          operates like an overarching network that runs on and is connected by
          information. Cosmic information “in-forms” and underlies the whole
          physical world, including the human body. Sharing stories of
          successful remote healings she facilitated and her interactions with
          pioneers Erich Körbler, Gordon Flint, and Franz Stern, Sagi shows that
          we can access the Akashic information field to diagnose illnesses,
          treat symptoms, and heal the causes of disease, whether we are in the
          same room as our patient or on the other side of the earth.
          <br /><br />Moving beyond the theoretical to the practical, Sagi
          explains how to diagnose and treat someone with information and how to
          attune to the information emanating from the patient. She shares
          techniques for transferring healing information across space and time
          by using geometric symbols to treat acute illnesses and infections and
          reduce pain. The author also explores how to integrate information
          medicine with homeopathy and how to diagnose through photographs,
          through the chakras, and through morphic patterns in the Akashic
          information field. <br /><br />Opening up a new dimension in the art
          and science of healing, Maria Sagi demonstrates that by working with
          the Akashic information field we can trigger the body’s self-healing
          mechanisms and restore order to a person’s energy and information
          systems.

          “Current science is going through seismic paradigm shifts suggesting
          that all existence is consciousness and its modified expressions, that
          fundamental reality is nonlocal, and that intention is how
          consciousness organizes its own fulfillment. These revelations lay the
          basic framework for dormant human potentials such as remote healing.
          This book will give insight into a phenomenon known in wisdom
          traditions across the world and now getting the attention of healers
          and medical practitioners that it deserves.”
