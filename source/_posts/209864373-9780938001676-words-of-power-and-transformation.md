          <p>
            Drawing from an ancient well of magickal power, the same divine
            source used by acclaimed sorcerers, witches and spiritual masters
            through the ages, the 101+ magickal words and sigils are revealed to
            the public for the very first time. They can create quick and often
            profound improvements in your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            It doesn't matter what religion you follow or what you believe or do
            not believe. The magickal words and sigils are like mystical keys
            that open secret doors regardless of who holds the key. If you put
            the key in and turn it, the door will open and the magick will swirl
            around you!
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginner to the Adept, the Celestine Light words of power
            and sigils will expand your world and open up possibilities that may
            have seemed previously unachievable. Everything from something
            simple like finding a lost object, to something powerful like
            repelling a psychic or physical attack, to something of need such as
            greater income, to something life changing like finding your Soul
            Mate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some may wonder how a few spoken words combined with looking for
            just a moment at a peculiar image could have such immediate and
            often profound effects. The secret is these are ancient magick words
            of compelling power and the sigils are the embodiment of their
            magickal essence. Speaking or even thinking the words, or looking at
            or even picturing the sigil in your mind, rapidly draws angelic and
            magickal energies to you like iron to a magnet to fulfill the worthy
            purpose you desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a book of potent white magick of the light. Without a lot of
            training or ritual, it gives you the ability to overcome darkness
            threatening you from inside or out. For what is darkness except
            absence of the light? When light shines, darkness fades and
            disappears, not with a roar, but with a whimper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use the words and sigils to call in the magickal energies to
            transform and improve your life in every aspect. In this
            comprehensive book you will find activators to propel your personal
            growth, help you excel in school, succeed in your own business, or
            launch you to new heights in your profession. It will give you fast
            acting keys to improve your relationships, change your luck,
            revitalize your health, and develop and expand your psychic
            abilities.
          </p>
          <p>

          27th. The checks came yesterday. I'm so SHOCKED and EXCITED!"

          you it is a POWERFUL book. These words of power combined with the
          sigils connect you within seconds to powerful forces that will work
          with you to bring about change in your life." ~&nbsp;Clearblueskies<br /><br />"This

          It will gradually transform YOUR life when YOU put YOUR mind to it."
          ~&nbsp;<strong>^_^</strong><br /><br />"An extensive list of Words of
          Power with audio files for pronunciation of each Word..(cool)."
          ~&nbsp;bfl428<br /><br />"Really excellent book. I got very obvious
          results right off the bat using this very simple but powerful method.
          The author makes it very clear that you will get the results with
          incredible ease and he is not joking. This is a brilliant book."

          “I like the book and have used it successfully to improve aspects of
          my life. I can't explain it rationally, but it works. The information
          is contemporary and ancient. Regardless of its history - the book
          delivers.” ~&nbsp;Earthian

          “Fantastic book! This was a very good read, something I will utilize
          and use in just about any occasion. The words of Power and sigil used
          for anger or to help calm down worked immensely. One thing that has
          continually helped me is to use the Words of Power slowly and mentally
          think and visualize the sigil in your minds eye. It will help
          materialize your desired effect. I love this book and wish everyone
          had access to it to help with whatever is challenging them. I highly
          recommend it to everyone.”&nbsp;~ Matt Pepple&nbsp;

          “My adult son was very angry ( at himself for doing something stupid)
          on a family beach vacation. I was stuck in the car with him for hours.
          I didn’t want to put up with his mood. I stared at the sigil to
          improve some one’s mood and said Magic words to myself. Within a
          minute or two he was back to chatting. Then he got into politics and
          was being a little mean spirited. So I did the one about making people
          less critical. Yep. That worked too. Interesting book. And the words
          are just fun to say. I love that part.”&nbsp;~ Ann Tweardy&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
