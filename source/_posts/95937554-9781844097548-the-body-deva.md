          A step-by-step guide to accessing the body deva, your body
          consciousness, for physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual healing
          <br /><br />• Details how to dialogue with the consciousness of your
          body to heal a variety of issues, from physical pains to limiting
          beliefs <br /><br />• Explains how our bodies, consciousness, and
          spirit are interconnected and how our physical bodies hold emotions
          and past traumas <br /><br />• Explores how to work with the body deva
          to heal spiritual patterns through the physical body, including
          techniques of ancestral healing, past life healing, and karmic
          resolution <br /><br />We are not our pain or our disease, nor are we
          defined by our limitations, restrictions, or the labels given to us.
          We are a whole body, a consciousness, and a spiritual being. As a
          holistic, interconnected being, our emotions, beliefs, physical pain,
          past traumas, and even imbalances created through spiritual issues are
          held within our physical form. By accessing them through the physical
          body with the body deva--the spiritual consciousness of our human
          body--we can heal the continuum of mind, body, and spirit.
          Understanding this is the true key to healing. <br /><br />In this
          step-by-step guide to understanding and working with the body deva,
          the consciousness of your body, Mary Mueller Shutan explains how our
          bodies hold the traumatic energies, emotions, physical issues, and
          restricting beliefs that cause us pain and feelings of disconnection.
          She details how to make contact and dialogue with your body deva to
          heal a variety of issues, from physical pains to ancestral and past
          life patterns to limiting ideas about what we can accomplish in this
          world. By working with the body deva, she shows how we can discover
          the reasons why our pain, beliefs, or imbalances developed and resolve
          them to heal mind, body, and spirit, every layer of our being. She
          explores how to work with the archetypes, labels, limiting beliefs,
          and myths that underlie our unique history and reasons for being.
          Shutan also examines how to work with the body deva to heal spiritual
          patterns through the physical body, including techniques of ancestral
          healing, past life healing, and karmic resolution. <br /><br />By
          learning to dialogue with the body deva, you can understand who you
          are on the deepest levels. You can learn why your pain and imbalances
          came to be and what lies unhealed within you. You can evolve beyond
          the limitations and restrictions in your body and your life and evolve
          into greater health, connection, joy, and consciousness.
