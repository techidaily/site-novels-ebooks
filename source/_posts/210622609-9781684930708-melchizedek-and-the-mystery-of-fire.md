            Melchizedek and the Mystery of Fire: A Treatise in Three Parts
            (1926) is a short work by mystic and occultist Manly P. Hall. It
            explores the symbolism of ancient rituals in Christianity, and their
            sources in earlier religions and cultural traditions. It also
            explains the human body's "occult anatomy," giving meaning and
            symbolism to our very organs and glands.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Canadian-born Manly P. Hall (1901-1990) was a writer and lecturer of
            mysticism for over 70 years. Introduced to the mysteries of the
            ancient world upon moving to Los Angeles in 1919, he quickly became
            a preacher at the Church of the People. At just 18 years old, he
            spoke about Pythagoras and Plato, along with newer doctrines like
            Theosophy and Rosicrucianism.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Soon, this intense young man had caught the attention of the wealthy
            Carolyn Lloyd and her daughter, Estelle. The Lloyds became his
            patrons, funding an expedition around the world that gave Hall
            insight into ancient religions and traditions across the globe. He
            collected an extensive library of rare books of philosophy which he
            brought back with him to Los Angeles.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Over a seven-decade career, Hall embarked on an ambitious career of
            writing and lectures, giving thousands of talks throughout his life
            including two at Carnegie Hall. He wrote 150 books and pamphlets,
            plus countless essays. One of his earlier works is Melchizedek and
            the Mystery of Fire.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Melchizedek is a Biblical figure who first appears in Genesis
            14:18-20. He was a priest-king who offered bread and wine to Abraham
            after returning from battle. This is often considered a precursor to
            the eucharist in the New Testament.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The book does not focus on Melchizedek, but uses him as a starting
            point to explore the mysteries of ancient symbols and how they have
            been incorporated into modern religion-specifically Christianity.
            Hall believed that the stories of the Bible were allegorical and
            that there were secrets hidden within the parables. In his view,
            today's Christians and Biblical scholars, while well-intentioned,
            are unable to look beyond the traditions they have inherited to the
            truth within.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Despite its short length, Melchizedek is packed full of information
            on mysticism. Incorporating ritual and legend from great ancient
            civilizations as varied as India, China, Mexico, and Japan, Hall
            demonstrates that the truth of humanity is rooted in similar stories
            across these cultures, and has continued into Biblical
            allegory.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The final part of the work explores the human body, detailing the
            nerve centers, internal organs, spinal column, and glands. Hall
            associates different parts of the body with signs of the zodiac, and
            with places and events from the Bible and other spiritual stories.
            He felt that each human was a universe to himself, a living temple
            with its own High Priest.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Hall continued to grow in popularity and prominence throughout the
            1920s and 1930s. In the early 1930s, he founded the Philosophical
            Research Society, creating a home for metaphysical thought and
            education, and for his extensive library. While some of the books
            were unfortunately auctioned off after his death, over 25,000
            remain. The center is still in operation today.
