          An exploration of the role that dreaming, psychedelic experiences, and
          mystical visions play in visionary art <br /><br />• Includes
          discussions with 18 well-known female artists, including Josephine
          Wall, Allyson Grey, Amanda Sage, Martina Hoffmann, Penny Slinger, and
          Carolyn Mary Kleefeld <br /><br />• Reveals how they have all been
          inspired by deep inner experiences and seek to express non-ordinary
          visions of reality, reminiscent of shamanic trance states, lucid
          dreams, and spiritually transcendent experiences <br /><br />• Shows
          how visionary art often contains an abundance of feminine energy,
          helping us to heal ourselves and see that we are all connected<br /><br />
          Since early humans first painted from their mystic eye onto cave
          walls, artists have sought to share their sacred visions with the
          world. Created in every medium, from oil painting and sculpture to
          contemporary digital modeling, these visionary works of art give those
          who experience them a chance to “see the unseen,” realize wider modes
          of perception, and discover spiritual and mystical realms.
          <br /><br />In this full-color illustrated book, David Jay Brown and
          Rebecca Ann Hill examine the work and inspirations of eighteen of
          today’s leading female visionary artists, including Josephine Wall,
          Allyson Grey, Amanda Sage, Martina Hoffmann, Penny Slinger, and
          Carolyn Mary Kleefeld. They explore the creative process and the role
          that dreaming, psychedelic experiences, sexuality, and divine guidance
          play in the work of these women, alongside full-color examples of
          their art. They discuss the future of visionary art and reveal how
          these artists have all been informed and inspired by deep inner
          experiences and seek to express non-ordinary visions of reality, often
          reminiscent of those encountered in shamanic trance, lucid dreams,
          psychedelic states, spiritually transcendent experiences, and other
          altered states. <br /><br />Showing how visionary art often contains
          an abundance of feminine energy, helping us to heal ourselves and see
          that we are all connected, the authors explore with each artist what
          it is about being a woman that has most influenced their artwork. They
          also examine the connection between visionary art and spirituality,
          the influence of Nature and sacred geometry, and how this creative
          form is simultaneously ancient, futuristic, and timeless, providing an
          accessible doorway into the visionary realm.
