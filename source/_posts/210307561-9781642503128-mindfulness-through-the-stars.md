            >In this beginner’s guide for amateur astrologists, learn how to use
            astrology houses to gain personal insight and cultivate
            relationships.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Overcome insecurities, love your flaws, and shine like a star.
          Embracing the astrological energy of each unique personality in your
          world can provide cosmic relief to everyday chaos and noise. As the
          planets cycle through the houses of the horoscope, so do individual
          ups and downs. Taking astrology aspects like your sun sign and rising
          sign into consideration, Mindfulness Through the Stars teaches you to
          use your personal horoscope for self-knowledge and self-care.<br /><br />
          All horoscope signs have a good, a bad, and an ugly. And each zodiac
          personality trait can provide guidance to target improvement and
          encouragement and become an evolved version of your sign. On this
          journey of celestial self-development, learn how to take better care
          of the body, mind, and spirit with topics like astrology compatibility
          and mindfulness activities. Aries, enjoy a facial with your Leo
          bestie. Sagittarius, unwind with a little wine and a new book. No
          matter your sign, it’s time to listen to the secret language of the
          stars.<br /><br />
