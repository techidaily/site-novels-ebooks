            ><br /><br />In this continuation of the Warrior Goddess path,
            author HeatherAsh Amara shares a revolutionary new method to help
            you reconnect with your sense of authenticity and power.
            <br /><br />Too often we allow old narratives—about past failures,
            broken relationships, or damaging experiences—to define us,
            depleting our joy, limiting our passion, and whispering the
            poisonous lie that we are not enough. <br /><br /><i
              >The Warrior Heart Practice</i
            >
            is a revolutionary new method that will help you reevaluate those
            well-worn narratives and shift your thinking and intentions in a
            new, empowered way. Based on the four divisions of the heart, the
            practice leads you forward through the four chambers of
            experience—Feeling, Story, Truth, Intent—gently questioning your own
            assumptions along the way, and then back through the chambers in the
            reverse, so that you emerge armed with a clear understanding of your
            situation and a new sense of purpose and power. <br /><br />For
            those who have loved and lived <i>Warrior Goddess Training</i> and
            readers who are searching for a new freedom, The Warrior Heart
            Practice offers an inner revolution and a new path towards freedom.

          Irresistible, engaging, and liberating in a way that only the truth
          can. A much-needed guide to moving beyond the chatter of the mind and
          the noise of the emotions to discovering true peace.<br />—Alberto
          Villoldo Ph.D. Author of One Spirit Medicine and Shaman, Healer,
          Sage.<br /><br /><br />In this wonderfully helpful and enlightening
          book, HeatherAsh Amara tells us that “In each moment we have the
          choice to wake up, reconnect to our inner light, and stop believing
          the stories and lies our minds tells us.” Drawing from personal
          stories and deep wells of Toltec wisdom, HeatherAsh has produced a
          masterpiece of a guidebook to show us the way to transformation. You
          are “a brilliant, nuclear-bomb force of love and potential” she tells
          us. I love hearing that, and reading HeatherAsh’s book, I believe it.

          transforms life. HeatherAsh Amara shares her own story in a way that
          gives her the credibility as a teacher and reveals how her own
          extraordinary quest for healing and joy is universal. We all want what
          she has offered here with her trademark humility and sense of
          humor.<br />—Jacob Nordby, author: Blessed are the Weird--A Manifesto
          for Creatives<br /><br /><br />HeatherAsh Amara has the amazing gift
          of identifying key issues that are critical for us to look at in order
          to experience our authentic self, our truth, and to feel empowered.
          The Warrior Heart is filled with a wealth of tools to perform an inner
          clearing of old stories, release agreements that limit us and leave us
          feeling stuck and disconnected from our creative strength. This book
          is written with so much clarity and depth that it guides us into a
          whole new perception, new ways to operate in life and greet our
          light-filled presence. The Warrior Heart lays out a path for us that
          is filled with treasures. HeatherAsh Amara is a brilliant guide!
          <br />—Sandra Ingerman, MA award-winning author of 12 books including
          Soul Retrieval and The Book of Ceremony: Shamanic Wisdom for Invoking
          the Sacred into Everyday Life <br /><br />HeatherAsh takes readers on

          Practice is a powerful inquiry practice that will help anyone, from
          business people to athletes, from parents to those working through
          trauma or abuse, and from those in recovery or in big life transition
          to claim their courage and power and step into their most authentic
          self. <br />—Dannion Brinkley, author of Saved by the Light<br /><br /><br />HeatherAsh
          Amara is a trustworthy and seasoned guide, helping us discover the
          unexplored regions of our hearts. She gets us to the real questions,
          leading us towards lives that agree with our deepest convictions. The
          Warrior Heart Practice is an invaluable resource for finding out what
          we really want and who we really are.<br />—Clark Strand and Perdita
          Finn, authors of The Way of the Rose: The Radical Path of the Divine
          Feminine Hidden in the Rosary<br /><br /><br />Life is a big,
          sometimes fantastic, sometimes tragic, sometimes mysterious, sometimes
          the same ol' ride through time and space. Along our journey, we ALL
          take on a lot of stuff, Stories, opinions, fears, scorecards, awards
          and heartbreaks. There comes a point, a very important point where we
          might step back and look into the mirror of our life for the sake of
          cleaning house, heart, and soul. This book and all of HeatherAsh's
          teaching serve that most important time. We deserve the opportunity to
          clean our self and shed the skins of what is not serving us. This is
          it. Just do it - you will be so glad you did.<br />—Lee R. Mccormick,
          author of The Spirit Recovery Books, Medicine Bag, Meditation Journal,
          Heart Reconnection Guidebook<br /><br /><br />HeatherAsh Amara’s
          genius resides in embodying a state of being undivided, of integrity,
          and of clear perception. As I read, I am aware of an authentic energy.
          In this book, she leads us through ancient teachings with a feminine
          touch that both opens our hearts and builds the inner warrior. She
          guides us through our tumultuous feelings and our calcified stories to
          a collaborative intent, an intent that links us with the larger forces
          of possibility radiating from our big souls. For close to a decade, I
          have walked with HeatherAsh on the Teotihuacan path of consciousness,
          and her new book distills that wisdom into everyday life practice, one
          that does my heart good.<br />—Will Taegel, Ph.D., author of Walking
          With Bears: On Bridges to Earth’s New Era<br /><br /><br />"By walking
          bravely with open hearts through the Four Chambers, we navigate the
          turbulent waters of life to overcome depression, alienation, and
          wounding. We emerge empowered with the warrior’s heart energy to
          become a beacon of light in our world."<br />—Luisah Teish, author of

            Practical Rituals<br /><br /></i
          >"In <i>Warrior Heart</i>, HeatherAsh tackles the murky landscape
          where personal experience mingles with external facts, and guides us
          beyond the repetitive stories that no longer serve us to absolute
          freedom. This is more than just learning resilience. HeatherAsh is
          channeling a power source that ignites our soul's calling - exactly
          the medicine our hearts are longing for. Brava!"<br /><br />—Chantal
          Pierrat, CEO, Emerging Women<br /><br />“While driving around in a
          truck hauling an Airstream Camper, back and forth from New Mexico to
          New York, living life, HeatherAsh Amara wrote a marvelous book.
          <i>The Warrior Heart Practice</i> is an inner journey towards inner
          healing and peace, through feeling, story, truth and intent—the Four
          Chambers of the Warrior Heart. This book is a reflection of a warrior
          putting into practice all that she has learned, the moment when
          knowledge turns into wisdom, in order to heal a heart that is not
          afraid to love.”<br />— Don Miguel Ruiz Jr, author of T<i

          >"I was exhilarated reading HeatherAsh Amara's
          <i>The Warrior Heart Practice</i>. She arouses us to step out of our
          little stories into a bigger and braver story. She guides us, chamber
          by chamber, through the practice of finding and following the truth of
          the heart. She prepares us to rise to the perspective of a witness
          self who can observe our everyday behavior and attitudes from a
          perspective that often escapes us in the confusion of ordinary life.
          She inspires us to be artists of life and wide-awake dreamers who can
          manifest what we most deeply desire when we move beyond ego agendas,
          follow the secret wishes or our souls, and recruit the wisdom of the
          body and the blessing of a greater self."<br /><br />—Robert Moss,
