          In October 2007, a new phenomenon appeared in the sky, was named the
          Comet Holmes, and is being claimed and acclaimed by the Hopi Nation as
          the Blue Star of their prophecy. The Blue Star is the harbinger.
          Between now and somewhere in 2013-2014, when the Red Star appears,
          great shifts in human consciousness will continue. With the
          fulfillment of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 2012 and the
          appearance of the Red Star, many are predicting that human
          consciousness will rise to the next level. Although there may be
          catastrophic events associated with this period, and life as we know
          it will surely change, if we do the work, this will not be the
          Apocalypse. In <i>The Astrology of 2012 and Beyond</i>, Garrison
          explores the changing sky, starting with the movement of Pluto into
          Capricorn, a region it hasn’t inhabited since 1733. It’s revolutionary
          times coming for individuals, governments, and the planet. Garrison
          draws on traditional astrology and her understanding of the Hopi
          prophecies and their relationship to the Mayan 2012 predictions, as
          well as the ending of the 13,000 year masculine kundalini cycle, to
          offer practical advice and information that will help us evolve
          through the next four years, including what to expect during the
          nearly inevitable polar shift.

          "If you're even remotely curious about the insights of astrology, this
          is the book and now is the time. In one of the most realistic,
          transcendent, and yet compassionate astrological interpretations we’re
          likely to find, Cal Garrison offers big-picture answers that help make
          sense of 2012 prophecies and sheds light onto some of the most
          troubling questions of our day. How likely are the 2012 prophecies?
          Very. What choices do we have? Many. Through a wonderful marriage
          between astrology and the wisdom of our ancestors, Garrison reveals
          not only what to expect before 2012, but what internal preparations we
          might make on the way. Though we live in a time of great promise, it's
          not a time to sit back." --Jock Whitehouse, author of
          <i>The Ledge of Quetzal, Beyond 2012</i>
