          I Married a Mystic—one woman’s leap of faith to discover a love that
          never ends.<br /><br />It was a surprise to gutsy, Kirsten Buxton when
          Jesus appeared to her, announcing he would be her guide. At
          twenty-seven years of age, a serious bike accident had left her
          physically, psychologically, and emotionally devastated, with no
          control over her life. Having had no previous relationship with Jesus,
          she began studying A Course in Miracles, and developing trust in the
          Spirit within. Miraculously, world-renowned teacher of A Course in
          Miracles, David Hoffmeister, visited her hometown. Jesus told Kirsten
          to trust this man completely in order to experience a relationship
          like no other. Her courageous acceptance of this guidance opened her
          heart and mind in ways she never could have imagined.<br /><br />Throughout
          this diary of radical self-inquiry, Kirsten candidly exposes her
          fears, projections, and private thoughts whilst on an epic adventure
          of holy relationship with a tirelessly happy mystic! A must read for
          those seeking to intimately apply non-dual spiritual teachings in
          every aspect of daily experience: in the bedroom, the bathroom, and
          even the supermarket.<br /><br />This profound and often humorous
          account is literally a ‘how-to’ guide for awakening.
