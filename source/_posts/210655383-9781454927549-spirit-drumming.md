            >A heartfelt examination of the spiritual power of Native American
            drumming, including authentic stories, chants, and rituals.</b

            >Perhaps the first conscious beating of the drum sound occurred as
            we gestated in the wombs of our mothers.<br />
            Beat after beat, we grew within the sea of our births, and then we
            were born into the air of the world—<b
              >when did we begin to separate from that beat?<br />
              How long will it be before we hear the beating again?</b

          Gabriel Horn, White Deer of Autumn, is an award-winning writer who has
          provided a nuanced look at Native American culture and spirituality
          for decades. Now, he shows how drumming can take us back to our true
          selves and connect us to each other and the earth.
          <i>Spirit Drumming</i> follows his journey to the drums, including a
          history of drumming in Native American communities, an investigation
          of drums as living beings, and an authoritative reckoning on vibration
          as a conduit for healing.<br /><br />
          In addition to sharing stories of people he has known who have been
          affected by the drums, he also provides information on how to
          integrate other sacred elements in your drumming (such as feathers,
          cedar, sweetgrass, and tobacco), transcripts of chants you can use in
          your own practice, and ceremonies for thanksgiving, birth, the
          harvest, children, and more.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <i>Booklist</i> called Gabriel Horn “A generous, searching writer…”
          and his work “…mesmerizing… lyrical… powerful.” He is an award-winning
          author and retired professor of literature and creative writing whose
          publications span across four decades. Excerpts of his works have been
          anthologized in college texts on writing and for Western Humanities,
          and included in several acclaimed literary anthologies. Gabriel has
          also instructed young journalists for the Poynter Institute for Media
          Studies and taught graduate courses and addressed audiences at
          universities across the country. On different occasions, he served as
          a wisdomkeeper for The Wisdomkeepers Program in North Carolina, where
          he also cofounded and codirected the first Native American Writers
          Camp for children on the Cherokee reservation. He has been a special
          guest on various local television programs, National Public Radio,
          MSNBC’s <i>Time &amp; Again</i>, Wolf Mountain Radio for Peace
          International, and a record-breaking listening audience on Gia Scott’s
          radio program,<i> Dawn of Shades</i>. For over 40 years, from
          reservation schools, to American Indian Movement (AIM) Survival
          Schools, to public schools, colleges, and universities, Gabriel Horn
          has unwaveringly advocated the academic respect due the history,
          literature, and philosophy of Native America as well as for the
          spiritual rights of traditional Native peoples and the natural world.
          His Narragansett/Wampanoag uncles, Metacomet and Nippawanock, wrote of
          Gabriel: “We are proud of our nephew, for it is in blood as strong as
          his, that the words of the people ring on the land.” He lives in FL.
