          Reveals sacred spiritual tools to connect with the love, passion, and
          creative powers of the Great Mother for spiritual transformation
          <br /><br />• Explores the three faces of the Great Mother’s love and
          wisdom in our lives and how to build our magician’s wand, which
          enables us to be masters of our creativity <br /><br />• Details the
          journey of the soul through the twelve signs of the zodiac to
          integrate the shadow self and embody the soul’s true light
          <br /><br />• Explains how we are being called to birth a new world,
          one that embraces the divine feminine qualities of intuition,
          emotional creative power, and rhythmic renewal <br /><br />The year
          2012 marked the birth of a new cycle of time that will last for the
          next 26,000 years. In charge of such birth is the Great Mother, the
          eternal source of all creation. She is calling on the feminine within
          us all to create a world worthy of the next seven generations and
          begin an era of peace, abundance, and spiritual evolution. To birth
          this new world, we must release our hold on old destructive patterns
          and instead embrace the divine feminine qualities of intuition,
          powerful creativity, and rhythmic renewal. <br /><br />As Christine
          Page reveals, the Great Mother hears our heart’s yearning to escape
          our old ways of suffering and struggle to find peace, fulfillment, and
          joy. She is reaching out to us across the dimensions, offering
          spiritual initiation and the chance to know ourselves fully right now.
          Dr. Page explains how important it is to acknowledge and integrate our
          shadow selves--the unloved parts of us--so we can radiate our light
          from the fullness of who we are without shame or judgment. Drawing on
          alchemy and mythology, the author details the journey of the soul
          through the twelve signs of the zodiac until our inner light shines.
          She also explores how to connect with and use sacred spiritual tools
          to open our hearts and merge with the Great Mother’s love and creative
          powers. <br /><br />Exploring the mythology of the Triple Goddess, the
          author explains how the three faces of the Great Mother help us on our
          spiritual journey of transformation: As virgin she inspires us to
          manifest our dreams. As mother, she teaches us to celebrate and
          nurture all living things, especially ourselves. As crone, she shows
          us that creativity changes like the seasons, encouraging us not to be
          possessed by our creations but to embrace mystery and impermanence.
          Finally, the Great Mother emboldens us to build our magician’s wand,
          the rod of light along the spine which enables us to be masters of our
          creativity, bringing forth transformation for ourselves and
          generations of children still to come as we embark into a new era of
          expanded consciousness and love.

          "These two books both contain an incredibly powerful message for our
          time. The message of the Fierce Feminine, the Dark Mother, a
          collective upwelling of universal outrage and sacred rage at the way
          we are treating the planet and each other. You will probably have seen
          the various videos featuring a message from the virus telling us to
          consider the essentials and expressing the Earth’s relief at a slowing
          down of our frenetic activity. Christine expresses this [in The Heart
          of the Great Mother] as the Dark Goddess calling 'time' for all of us
          now: ‘she is not interested in our bargaining tactics, excuses, or
          entreaties, especially those linked to our small ego’s desire not to
          upset the status quo. It is time to move on…whether we are ready to or
          not.’"
