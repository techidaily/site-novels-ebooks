            The word "embodied" is one of those terms, such as "grounded" or
            "centered" that can be discussed forever without being
            experienced.<br /><br /><br />Defining embodiment, though, can be
            quite tricky, because much of what is taught in western societies
            about the body devalues the felt experience. <br /><br /><br />The
            categories of formal learning, particularly anatomy and physiology,
            are taught with the fundamental source being cadavers (dead bodies),
            and conceptualizations that do not include our own vitality, or life
            force. Without the felt experience, embodiment is just another
            concept that can be discussed ad nauseum. The felt experience (or
            "phenomenology" in academic-speak) is the path away from these
            endless discussions and conceptual befuddlement.<br /><br /><br />This
            book provides a basic training on how to become aware of our
            physiological functioning and our sense of vitality. A part of this
            training comes from becoming hyper-aware of how we breathe. This
            awareness makes it possible to feel our own organs and how they
            function and interrelate. To help us refine our awarenesses of our
            own organs we are entirely fortunate to learn and practice methods,
            developed over thousands of years by Indian and Chinese cultures.<br /><br /><br /><br />
            With these fundamentals this book leads us through a series of
            connected experiences using mudras to feel our organs, the flows of
            our life force (Qi) and the flow of that life force through our
            meridians. From that we learn to feel our own chakras and sushumna
            (central channel), and our ability to perceive our connections with
            our environment and ecosystem. This then provides the basis for a
            body sense of our spiritual existence and development. Thus the
            definition of embodiment evolves into deeper awareness within our
            bodies and deeper connection to the world.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Bill Harvey has been a Certified Rolfer since 1984, Certified Advanced
          Rolfer since 1990, Rolf Movement Practitioner since 1999, and
          Biodynamic Craniosacral practitioner since 1984. His interest in
          combining these three approaches while working with clients led to the
          develop-ment of his trainings in Biodynamic Structural Integration,
          which began in 2005.The problem of figuring out how to not run out of
          breath while distance running, and being around adults with emphysema,
          captured Harvey's interest in breathing at an early stage. A large
          part of the attraction that Rolfing held for him lay in that
          discipline's ability to alter the texture and pliability of the
          intercostal muscles of the ribcage so that there could be more room
          for the lungs to expand, and more ease throughout the thorax to allow
          the lungs to de-flate more fully. Since the early 80s his professional
          interest in breathing has followed two paths of inquiry: 1) how to
          free up tissue within the body, by working with connective tissue; by
          increasing the mo-tility of the individual lobes of the lungs through
          visceral manipulation; how to tease out limit-ing habitual holding
          patterns through movement therapy; and how to titrate out emotional
          and kinetic charge through Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy; and 2) to
          discover whether or not there are any inherent feedback loops within
          the body that can be called upon to support our activities.During his
          more than three decade full-time career in manual therapies, Harvey
          has also pur-sued a variety of interests that deepened his work and
          instruction of Structural Integration. These interests have centered
          on questions of how life works. What is our proper place in Na-ture?
          What is the relationship between the wiring of our nervous systems,
          established through our attachment patterns and our physical structure
          and behavior? What is the relationship be-tween our belief systems and
          structure? What is the relationship between ancestral patterns and
          structure and behavior? Most importantly, what can work with these
          realities?Our breathing activates the answers to these questions,
          leading us on a path to embodiment that clarifies and contextualizes
          our inner experiences within the natural world.
