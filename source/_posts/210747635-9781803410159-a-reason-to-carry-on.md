          Henry, a cockney arsonist and psychopath, was the catalyst to Vony's
          enlightenment. Ironically, she started out as the teacher and ended up
          as Eliza Doolittle, the na√Øve student. Perhaps Henry's unwitting
          mission was to help others by telling their story. Angry at a God
          following the death of a sibling, Vony initially rejected religion.
          Eventually she realized that religion, science and philosophy are
          compatible; without investigating them all, the answer to a meaningful
          life would be incomplete. As an exercise therapist teaching classes
          for psychiatric offenders, as well as in nursing homes for people
          living out their final furlong, Vony met Henry. In her work she
          encountered individuals of all ages with mental, physical and
          emotional disabilities in contrast to socializing with the rich and
          famous. She sought to understand them all through a looking glass of
          behavioral psychology, Bible studies, philosophy, poetry, Eastern
          religions, spiritualists, psychics and astrologers. Whatever their
          weaknesses or limitations, everyone is similar at their core, and the
          same universal, simple truths apply to finding a meaningful life for
          them all.
