          An exploration of the Persian poet’s spiritual philosophy, with
          original translations of his poetry <br /><br />• Features extensive
          insight into the meanings and contexts of the poetry and philosophies
          of this spiritual teacher<br /><br />• Includes over 30 complete poems
          by Haféz, including “The Wild Deer,” often regarded as his
          masterpiece<br /><br />For 600 years the Persian poet Haféz has been
          read, recited, quoted, and loved by millions of people in his homeland
          and throughout the world. Like his predecessor Rumi, he is a spiritual
          guide in our search for life’s essence. Haféz is both a mystic
          philosopher and a heartfelt poet of desires and fears.<br /><br /><i
            >Haféz: Teachings of the Philosopher of Love</i
          >
          is the perfect introduction to the man known as the philosopher of
          love, whose message of spiritual transcendence through rapture and
          service to others is especially important to our troubled world. His
          wisdom speaks directly to the cutting edge of philosophy, psychology,
          social theory, and education and can serve as a bridge of
          understanding between the West and the Middle East, two cultures in
          desperate need of mutual empathy.

        <p>
          Haleh Pourafzal (1956-2002) was the daughter of Abdol-Hossein
          Pourafzal, a lifelong student of Persian linguistics and direct
          descendant of the creator of the contemporary Farsi prose form. Haleh
          grew up tuned to the spirit of the great poet during her childhood in
          Tehran, where her father would perform daily recitations of Haféz’s
          poetry. She drew upon her father’s expertise in developing her own
          interpretations of the poet’s verse.From the moment Haleh introduced
          her husband, Roger Montgomery, to the poetry of Haféz, they shared a
          deep love and respect for his work. It was in the spirit of gaining a
          greater understanding of this great poet, sage, and philosopher that
          this book was born. Montgomery is also the author of
          <i>Twenty Count: Secret Mathematical System of the Aztec/Maya </i>and
          lives in Berkeley, California.
