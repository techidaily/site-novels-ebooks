          An in-depth study of humanity’s Anunnaki origins and the Anunnaki
          battle for an intelligent versus enslaved humanity <br />
          <br />• Explains the genetic engineering of humanity by an Anunnaki
          scientist Ninmah <br />
          <br />• Shows how the concepts of sin and the inferiority of women
          arose from Enlil’s will to keep humanity underdeveloped, clashing with
          Enki’s and Ninmah’s plan to make us equal in intelligence <br />
          <br />• Reveals how humanity’s long history of conflict was shaped by
          the battle between Enki and his brother Enlil <br />
          <br />Further developing the revolutionary work of Zecharia Sitchin,
          Chris Hardy shows that the “gods” of ancient myth, visitors from the
          planet Nibiru, created us using their own “divine” DNA--first through
          DNA extraction from their own ribs’ marrow and later by direct
          relations with early human females. Drawing upon multiple sacred
          texts, Hardy details the genetic engineering of humanity by Anunnaki
          scientist Ninmah, with the help of Enki and Hermes. She reveals how
          Ninmah’s first female human creation, Tiamat/Eve, contained more alien
          DNA than the earlier male one, Adamu, and how the biblical Noah
          represents the perfection of her work. <br />
          <br />Examining the war between Anunnaki brothers Enki and Enlil,
          Hardy reveals how the concepts of sin and the inferiority of women
          were born out of Enlil’s attempts to enslave and then wipe out
          humanity, repeatedly thwarted by Enki and Ninmah. The author further
          explains how the sacred sexuality taught to humans--still seen in
          Tantric practice--became suppressed millennia later by the patriarchal
          concept of original sin and how innocent Eve took the blame for the
          expulsion from Eden and fall from Grace. <br />
          <br />Showing that the god who created us was not the same god who
          expelled us from Eden, Hardy explains that there will be no apocalypse
          because the Good/Evil duality has never truly existed--it has been
          only enemy gods fighting and implicating humanity in the wake of their
          own competition for power. With a full psychological understanding of
          how the ancient “gods” have shaped humanity’s ongoing history of
          conflict, we can move beyond the framework of “(my) Good versus (your)
          Evil” imposed by Enlil and begin to steer our own planetary destiny.
