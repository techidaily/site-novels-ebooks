          The first English translation of articles from Maria de Naglowska’s
          newspaper, <i>La Flèche</i> <br />
          <br />• Introduces Naglowska’s advanced occult teachings on the Third
          Term of the Trinity and the spiritually transformative power of sex
          <br />
          <br />• Includes two never-before-published essays by Julius Evola
          <br />
          <br />• Contains the complete collection of articles from all 20
          issues, from October 1930 to January 1935 <br />
          <br />From October 1930 to January 1935, Maria de Naglowska--Russian
          mystic, esoteric high priestess, and self-styled “Satanic Woman” of
          1930s Paris--published 20 issues of her newspaper, <i>La Flèche</i>,
          which she sold on the streets of Montparnasse and by mail-order
          subscription. Bought by many now famous people, including André Breton
          and other Surrealists, the newspaper served as an introduction to
          Naglowska’s revolutionary religious system called the Third Term of
          the Trinity, which considered the Holy Spirit of Christianity to be
          feminine and taught the importance of sex for the upliftment of
          humanity. <br />
          <br />Available for the first time in English, this complete anthology
          of articles from all 20 issues of <i>La Flèche</i> includes an
          introduction and notes by translator Donald Traxler, who
          contextualizes Naglowska’s life and teachings within the larger occult
          systems of the time, such as Julius Evola’s Group of Ur. He explains
          how most of the articles were written by Naglowska herself, often
          under pseudonyms because of the controversial nature of her ideas. In
          addition to writings on sacred sexuality and religious philosophy,
          this collection includes essays on feminism and on other esoteric
          thinkers, such as René Guénon and Krishnamurti, as well as two
          never-before-published essays by Julius Evola on the magic of
          creation, the special power of symbols, and the march of progress and
          materialism.

        </h4>
        <p>
          MARIA DE NAGLOWSKA (1883–1936) was a Russian occultist, mystic, and
          founder of the Brotherhood of the Golden Arrow, whose conferences in
          Paris in the 1930s were attended by many now famous avant-garde and
          notorious writers and artists, such as Julius Evola, Man Ray, and
          André Breton. The author of <i>The Light of Sex</i>,
          <i>Advanced Sex Magic</i>, and <i>The Sacred Rite of Magical Love</i>,
          she is also known for her translation of P. B. Randolph’s
          <i>Magia Sexualis</i>, the classic occult text that has survived only
          through her translation. Donald Traxler is both a translator and
          student of the occult.
