          Claudio Naranjo’s psychedelic autobiography with previously
          unpublished interviews and research papers <br /><br />• Explores Dr.
          Naranjo’s pioneering work with MDMA, ayahuasca, cannabis, iboga, and
          psilocybin <br /><br />• Shares his personal accounts of psychedelic
          sessions and experimentation, including his work with Alexander
          “Sasha” Shulgin and Leo Zeff <br /><br />• Includes the author’s
          reflections on the spiritual aspects of psychedelics and his
          recommended techniques for controlled induction of altered states
          <br /><br />In the time of the psychedelic pioneers, there were
          psychopharmacologists like Alexander “Sasha” Shulgin, psychonauts like
          Aldous Huxley, and psychiatrists like Humphrey Osmond. Claudio Naranjo
          was all three at once. He was the first to study the psychotherapeutic
          applications of ayahuasca, the first to publish on the effects of
          ibogaine, and a long-time collaborator with Sasha Shulgin in the
          research behind Shulgin’s famous books. A Fulbright scholar and
          Guggenheim fellow, he worked with Leo Zeff on LSD-assisted therapy and
          Fritz Perls on Gestalt therapy. He was a presenter at the 1967
          University of California LSD Conference and, 47 years later, gave the
          inaugural speech at the First International Conference on Ayahuasca in
          2014. Across his career, Dr. Naranjo gathered more clinical experience
          in individual and group psychedelic treatment than any other
          psychotherapist to date. In this book, his final work, Dr. Naranjo
          shares his psychedelic autobiography along with previously unpublished
          interviews, session accounts, and research papers on the therapeutic
          effects of psychedelics, including MDMA, ayahuasca, cannabis, iboga,
          and psilocybin. <br /><br />The book includes Naranjo’s reflections on
          the spiritual aspects of psychedelics and the healing transformations
          they bring, his philosophical explorations of how psychedelics act as
          agents of deeper consciousness, and his recommended techniques for
          controlled induction of altered states using different visionary
          substances. Naranjo’s work shows that psychedelics have the strongest
          potential for transforming and healing people over all therapeutic
          methods currently in use.

          "Claudio Naranjo was a profound inspiration to me and to so many
          others. Claudio helped train MAPS' first therapist team for
          MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, for our study in Spain that
          began in 2000. Claudio's talk was the highlight of the recent World
          Ayahuasca Conference. Despite his health challenges, in his final days
          he indicated an interest in being involved in MAPS' psychedelic
          reconciliation project focused on Israelis and Palestinians who are
          taking ayahuasca and sometimes MDMA together. We honor Claudio's
          memory by continuing to work to develop MDMA and other psychedelics
          into prescription medicines, and beyond."
