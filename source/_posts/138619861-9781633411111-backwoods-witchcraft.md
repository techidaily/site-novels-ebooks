            In <i>Backwoods Witchcraft</i>, Jake Richards offers up a folksy
            stew of family stories, lore, omens, rituals, and conjure crafts
            that he learned from his great-grandmother, his grandmother, and his
            grandfather, a Baptist minister who Jake remembers could "rid
            someone of a fever with an egg or stop up the blood in a wound." The
            witchcraft practiced in Appalachia is very much a folk magic of
            place, a tradition that honors the seen and unseen beings that
            inhabit the land as well as the soil, roots, and plant life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The materials and tools used in Appalachia witchcraft are readily
            available from the land. This "grounded approach" will be of keen
            interest to witches and conjure folk regardless of where they live.
            Readers will be guided in how to build relationships with the
            spirits and other beings that dwell around them and how to use the
            materials and tools that are readily available on the land where one
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book also provides instructions on how to create a working
            space and altar and make conjure oils and powders. A wide array of
            tried-and-true formulas are also offered for creating wealth,
            protecting one from gossip, spiritual cleansing, and more.

          "Richards, owner of and folk magic teacher at Little Chicago Conjure
          in Jonesborough, Tenn., presents the charms, conjures, and culture of
          Appalachia in this enjoyable book meant to “piece together lost works
          and ways” he was taught by his great-grandmother. Raised in a family
          with a variety of spiritual influences—including African, European,
          and Native traditions—Richards paints a very personal portrait of his
          childhood spiritual education. At home, rituals and superstitions were
          not thought of as a specific magic system, but rather activities woven
          into everyday life, which is reflected in Richards’s rambling,
          conversational style. He organizes the wealth of material into
          categories that explore how to make use of tools (ribbon, yarn),
          techniques (fortune telling, reading omens), and remedies (cures for
          physical and spiritual ailments). For Richards, following natural
          cycles and engaging in activities such as gardening, farming, and
          hunting keep him “close to the rhythms and seasons of the hills.”
          Though seemingly at odds, the Christian religion plays a prominent
          role in Appalachian magic; Bible verses become templates for spells,
          and references to God, Jesus Christ, and the saints appear throughout
          the rituals. Richards lovingly, thoughtfully provides a rare look into
          the heritage of his people that will appeal to any reader interested
          in American folk spirituality." --<i><b>Publishers Weekly</b></i

        <p>
          While <b>Jake Richards</b> doesn't hold initiations, titles, or
          degrees, he clearly does hold his Appalachian heritage close to his
          blood and bones. He has practiced Appalachian folk magic for almost a
          decade and teaches classes on the subject in Jonesborough, Tennessee,
          where he owns Little Chicago Conjure, a supplier of Appalachian folk
          magic supplies and ingredients. &nbsp; <b>Starr Casas</b>, a veteran
          rootworker and traditional conjure woman, has been helping people for
          over 35 years through her ancestral art of old style conjure. She is
          one of the preeminent modern masters of this southern American style
          of folk magic, and she maintains an active teaching schedule. Starr is
          also among the organizers of the annual New Orleans Folk Magic
          Festival. Visit her at www.oldstyleconjure.com.
