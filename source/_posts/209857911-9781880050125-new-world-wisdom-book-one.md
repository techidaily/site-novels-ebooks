            Can we transform our tumultuous society? Is it even possible to save
            our ailing planet?<br />Yes, say the teachings in this book –
            channeled wisdom from a team of Ascended Masters, one of whom made
            his presence known to the young mother and mystic Lori Toye when she
            least expected it and could do little about it. It took decades to
            channel, transcribe, and publish the prophecies and counsel in this
            book, and even more time – and a second revised printing - for Toye
            to understand the meaning of the material: Prophecies are not
            predictions! Such messages are both metaphorical and literal. They
            are warnings with solutions to avoid what is prophesied. The
            chapters in this book contain information that explains how human
            consciousness has the ability to change and transform, and how this
            microcosmic effect literally extends – guiding social and cultural
            values, physically reshaping the planet's weather, sensitive
            ecosystems, and geography.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, we can change – by accepting our spiritual virtue and innate
            goodness; by learning to consciously cultivate the
            <strong>Twelve Jurisdictions</strong>, shared by the spiritual
            teachers; by engaging in our own personal Ascension process. The
            Spiritual Teachers who contributed their Wisdom call this process
            the “BE-coming.” Be. Come. Add you effort to engender the growth of
            a new global, cultural consciousness – the Golden Age.

            Lori Toye is known for the best-selling
            <strong>I AM America Earth Changes Maps</strong>, which introduced
            spiritual teachings of prophecy and the Time of Change. Her initial
            work was published more than twenty years ago before public
            awareness of the serious environmental issues of Global Warming and
            Climate Change. Lori's work has been featured on NBC, FOX, UPN,
            London's Carlton Television, in the Washington Post and the New York
            Times.

          The phrases global warming and climate change have been at the
          forefront attention of every nation on our planet. The problem is
          everyone has a different take on why it is happening, how fast it is
          occurring, and to whom it will have the most impact. This narrative is
          influenced by special interests, and of course, money. The spiritual
          wisdom presented in Lori Toye's New World Wisdom–Book One addresses
          this issue and details the many layers of Earth Changes: physical,
          metaphorical, and spiritual. Most importantly, these teachings confirm
          that
          <strong
            >Earth Changes Prophecy is not a superficial prediction of when
            destruction will come–but that Earth Changes are tied to our
            personal choices and behavior.</strong
          >
          Since our planet is a living organism, and has an energy field similar
          that is connected to our body's aura. These teachings link it all
          together with real meaning and cause. Perhaps the very best part is
          that New World Wisdom–Book One shows how our out-of-balance thoughts,
          feelings, and actions can be guided ever-upward through our choices
          and through applying the Twelve Jurisdictions of Divine Truth to
          ameliorate these changes. - Lee Emerson
