          A comprehensive exploration of familiars and their many forms and
          powers <br /><br />• Explores witch’s familiars in folklore, shamanic,
          and magical traditions around the world, including Africa, India,
          Scandinavia, ancient Greece, and China <br /><br />• Explains how
          familiars are related to shamanic power animals and how the witch
          draws on her personal sexual energy to give this creature its power
          <br /><br />• Examines the familiar in alchemical, Hermetic, and
          Egyptian magical literature, including instructions for procuring a
          supernatural assistant <br /><br />Exploring the history and creation
          of a “witch’s familiar,” also known as a spirit double or guardian
          spirit, Maja D’Aoust shows how there is much more to these
          supernatural servant spirits and guardians than meets the eye. She
          reveals how witches are not the only ones to lay claim to this
          magician’s “assistant” and examines how the many forms of witch’s
          familiars are well known in folklore throughout Europe and America as
          well as in shamanic and magical traditions around the world, including
          Africa, India, and China. <br /><br />The author explains how
          familiars are connected with shapeshifting and how the classic
          familiars of medieval witchcraft tradition are related to the power
          animals and allies of shamanic practices worldwide, including animal
          guardian spirits of Native American traditions and the daimons of the
          ancient Greeks and Romans. She examines the fetch spirit, also known
          as the <i>fylgia</i> in Scandinavian tradition, and how the witch or
          sorcerer draws on their personal sexual energy to give this creature
          its power to magnetize and attract what it was sent to retrieve. She
          looks at incubus, succubus, doubles, doppelgangers, and soul mates,
          showing how familiars can also adopt human forms and sometimes form
          romantic or erotic attachments with the witch or shaman.
          <br /><br />Reviewing alchemical, Hermetic, and Egyptian magical
          literature, including the nearly forgotten alchemical works of Anna
          Kingsford, D’Aoust explores their instructions for procuring the
          attention of a supernatural assistant as well as an extensive
          description of the alchemical wedding and how this ritual joins the
          magician and familiar spirit into a single unified consciousness.
          Exploring fairy familiars, she reveals how a practitioner can
          establish a “marriage” with a totemic plant or tree spirit, who, in
          return, would offer teachings about its medicinal and visionary
          powers. <br /><br />Delving deeply into the intimate relations of
          humanity with the spirit world, D’Aoust shows how forming connections
          with living forces other than human enables us to move beyond the ego,
          expand our magical abilities, as well as evolve our conscious
          awareness.

          “Guiding us gently through the realms of black cats and demon lovers,
          sibyls and oracles, earth angels and falling stars, Maja D’Aoust
          consistently returns to history and etymology as she reveals how
          familiar spirits, in their various shapes and forms, have always lived
          among us.”
