          How consciousness and quantum energies affect your genetic expression
          and the development of disease and chronic health conditions<br /><br />•
          Draws on cellular medicine, genetics, quantum physics, and
          consciousness studies to define the real underlying mechanisms of
          disease and how they can be addressed <br /><br />• Explains how
          consciousness influences quantum DNA to erase the genetic imprint of
          illness, allowing your body to remember how to function efficiently
          and effectively<br /><br />• Shares the author’s discoveries that
          enabled her to successfully heal the cellular dysfunction at the root
          cause of her cancer, tumors, chronic inflammation, and toxicity<br /><br />•
          Explores consciousness tools to re-encode DNA and includes detailed
          scripts for techniques that readers can apply to their own healing
          journeys<br /><br />Drawing on new advancements in quantum physics,
          cellular medicine, genetics, and consciousness studies, as well as her
          own journey of self-healing from a number of challenging health
          conditions, Althea S. Hawk reveals how you can consciously influence
          your DNA and re-encode it to improve your health and alter your
          genetic destiny.<br /><br />Sharing the discoveries that enabled her
          to successfully heal from her cancer, tumors, toxicity, and
          inflammatory-related conditions, the author explains how genes are not
          solely responsible for creating disease. She shows how human
          physiology interacts with the quantum energies of our external and
          personal environments and how the resulting information triggers the
          development and persistence of disease and chronic conditions. We each
          inherit susceptibilities, but it is our unique experience of these
          environmental factors, as well as our beliefs, thoughts, and emotions,
          that alter the way our genes are expressed. Detailing how our DNA is
          both quantum-energetic and biological-chemical, Hawk explains how your
          environment and your consciousness influence your quantum DNA, which
          in turn interacts with your biological DNA. By working directly with
          energetic information that affects how your quantum and biological DNA
          communicate, you can alter the expression of your genes by re-encoding
          the gene sequences on your physical DNA, erasing the imprint of
          illness and enabling your body to remember how to function
          properly.<br /><br />Hawk explores consciousness tools and mind-body
          techniques to re-encode your DNA, such as sound and breathing work,
          DNA marker removal, recalibration of Akashic information, and cellular
          communication exercises that readers can apply to their own healing
          journeys.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Althea S. Hawk is a healing practitioner and teacher who began her
          career in science and engineering. Her deteriorating health led to her
          discovery of quantum DNA healing and the powerful influences these
          non-physical forces played in her illness and recovery. She lives and
          works in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
