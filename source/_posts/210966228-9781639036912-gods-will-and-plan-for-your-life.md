          <p>
            Will God use me for a purpose and a plan in my life? If He will, how
            can I know it? When I hear these questions from people, I always
            say, "Yes, He will." His personal promise is that He does have a
            plan and purpose for your life. Just read Jeremiah 29:11. You're not
            going to understand everything that comes your way in life. Trust
            one thing: The same God who loved you enough to give you life loves
            you enough to plan for the future of the life that He has given you.
            God promises that if you seek Him, you will find Him; and in doing
            so, you will also discover His plan and purpose for your life (God's
            will).
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            A lot of people spend a lot of time wondering about how God's will
            is an enigma that cannot be figured out. This is a very common
            misconception. We can figure out the plans He has for us. All the
            details may not be crystal clear at first because God keeps some
            aspects of His will to Himself; but with study and meditation of
            God's Word, we can know the path to take in any given situation. He
            will never leave you searching for answers. You will have to spend
            time seeking Him for answers to your prayers; but once you do, He
            will never disappoint you. God is the only one who knows the plans
            He has for us and how they can be achieved. They are plans that hold
            renewed joy and peace. You must renew your mind with scripture from
            God.

            It's my desire that whoever reads this book will let God show His
            everlasting love in a fresh, new way. No doubt, once you come to
            Christ and accept Him as your Savior, the most profound aspect of
            the Christian life is discovering that He has a will and purpose not
            only for your heavenly life but also for every situation you face
            each day.
