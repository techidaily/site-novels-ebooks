          A practical guide to shamanic ancestor work, inspired by Huna and
          supported by guided rituals and exercises <br /><br />• Explains how
          to heal traumatic experiences and old blockages that are stored in the
          memory of your lineage <br /><br />• Includes Hawaiian teachings about
          spiritual and genetic ancestors and reveals how to bond with your
          spirit family, your Aumakua <br /><br />• Shows how unlocking the
          support of your ancestors enables you to shine your light fully
          <br /><br />Knowing your ancestral lineage is not only a matter of
          curiosity, your life path will unfold with much more ease if you are
          aware and in harmony with your origins. Exploring the heritage of your
          bloodline as well as the energy of your spiritual family, which we are
          often less aware of, opens you up to enormous potential for healing
          and self-development. <br /><br />This practical guide explains, in a
          clear and straightforward way, how the energy field of our ancestors
          influences our personal lives and how we can draw from their strength
          as well as liberate ourselves from burdens that have been carried over
          generations. It helps us to lift the veil of forgetting and allow
          ourselves to fully shine our light, supported by the souls that came
          before us, by making peace with past hurts and traumas. Drawing on the
          Huna Hawaiian shamanic tradition as well as other shamanic and
          energetic practices, the authors show how to connect with our Aumakua,
          our ancestors and higher self, which includes our close relatives,
          ancestors stretching back thousands of years, and our spiritual
          ancestors or karmic family. The authors offer practices to reconcile
          with our parents and spiritual family, uncover suppressed matters and
          family secrets, clear and charge our personal energy field and our
          family energy field, and awaken the potential of our bloodline. They
          explain how to perform an ancestor healing circle, carry out an
          ancestor release ritual, and offer blessings for children and
          grandchildren as well as providing meditative journeys to meet our
          ancestors, our spiritual family, and our spiritual roots in other
          realms. They also provide short case studies to illustrate how the
          rituals and exercises have worked for other people. <br /><br />By
          enacting ancestral healing, we can recognize who we are, where we come
          from, and truly fulfill our destiny in this life.
