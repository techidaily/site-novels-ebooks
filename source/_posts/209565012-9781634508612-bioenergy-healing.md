          Widely recognized as one of the most powerful healing methods that
          have ever been developed, bioenergy healing is relatively easy to
          learn. Csongor’s unique writingas if you were listening to him live at
          one of his seminarsmakes this comprehensive book on energy healing a
          light, yet very informative read. If you are a fast reader, you may
          learn to heal in only one day. By the end of the book, you will become
          a healer for a lifetime.<br /><br />Csongor Daniel was one of the
          first officially recognized bioenergy healers in the former
          Yugoslavia, trained by the legendary Zdenko Domancic. While his
          teacher has healed more than a million people, Csongor has no such
          ambitions. Instead, he would like to teach more than a million of you
          how to become healers yourselves. <i>Bioenergy Healing</i> will teach
          you how to feel and see the energy fields of the body and how to
          manipulate the energy in order to induce healing. QR codes throughout
          the book enable readers to see the techniques demonstrated in brief
          videos.<br /><br />Who needs <i>Bioenergy Healing</i>? Anyone who has
          ever dabbled in healing, but is still looking for the right method;
          people who read most books on energy healing, but are still puzzled by
          complicated approaches and explanations; individuals who want to learn
          energy healing, but are too busy to take months or years of courses;
          health professionals who want to add a new effective modality to their
          practices; parents and children who want to help their friends and
          family members reduce or eliminate pain and heal without drugs. In
          other words: everyone wanting to help others to heal.

          <b>Praise for Daniel Csongor’s works:</b><br /><br />"Outstanding
          exploration of a scientist turned healer's experience in working with
          patients to utilize the energy that fills the universe. This short
          volume teaches the reader how to cut to the core of health issues and
          live happily and healthily. [It] gets rid of the crutch mentality,
          where drugs and surgery are the only healing techniques and draws on
          the concepts of traditional medicine globally. Csongor Daniel uses the
          subtle methods of mind, body and spirit for healing and works with a
          clean environment, internally and externally."<br />Diane Wolff,<br />Author<br /><br />"In
          just 238 short pages Csongor eloquently yet simply explains that we
          all have the potential to heal. We are all energetic beings, and
          everything is energy. These are not easy concepts for most of us to
          accept or understand. Yet through undeniable scientific data, relating
          to our personal experiences and using his own often humorous stories,
          Csongor leaves you with no doubt that we all have the innate ability
          to heal simply using energy.<br /><br />What’s more, Csongor uses a
          quarter century of his own experience and the teachings he received
          from his Master to reveal a system of healing that will forever change
          the way you experience and understand how we create disease in the
          body, how the body heals, and how we can heal each other."<br />Stephen
          Edwards,<br />Author, Speaker<br /><br />"I have training in the
          Domancic bioenergy healing method, personal bioenergy healing
          experience with Csongor Daniel, and mentoring experience with him as
          well. It is a privilege to share my impressions of his latest book.
          First and foremost, it is a nicely distilled documentation of
          bioenergy theory, exercises, and practice. It is therefore quite
          useful to apprentice and novice energy healers. Experienced bioenergy
          healers will find utility in the compendium of protocols in the book.
          As a psychotherapist who is blending bioenergy with psychotherapy, I
          am appreciative of the case studies detailing how bioenergy treatments
          are integrated with other modalities. Csongor's writing style is easy
          to read. He invites the reader along at a nice but effective pace.
          It's a worthy read for anyone interested in bioenergy healing."<br />Gregory
          Boyce, M.A.,<br />Author,
          <i>No More Drama: A Practical Guide to Healthy Relationships</i
          ><br /><br />"Csongor Daniel has the most amazing balanced energy of
          anyone I've ever met. He has the ability to then use this incredible
          talent for the good of others. Not only have I watched him heal with
          his abilities, I've been a recipient of his work. I credit Csongor
          with giving my life back to me when I thought fibromyalgia and chronic
          fatigue had reduced my life to that of an invalid. I always refer
          clients to him with the greatest of confidence. I also teach my
          Intuitive Arts students his process of learning to 'see,' 'feel,' and
          'use' energy directly from his book,
          <i>Bioenergy: A Healing for the 21st Century</i>. He truly is a gift
          to all of us."<br />Betty McCormack,<br />Master Practitioner of
          Intuitive Arts
