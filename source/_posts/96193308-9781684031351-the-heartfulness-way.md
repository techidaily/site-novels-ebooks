            Heartfulness is an ideal, a spiritual way of living by and from the
            heart that is inclusive of all ideologies, beliefs, and religions.
            In this heart-centered book, a student in conversation with his
            teacher, Kamlesh D. Patel—affectionately known as Daaji, the fourth
            and current spiritual guide of the century-old Heartfulness
            tradition—present a unique method of meditation with the power to
            facilitate an immediate, tangible spiritual experience, irrespective
            of a person’s faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our modern, fast-paced world can be an overwhelming place. Every
            day, we’re bombarded with messages telling us that in order to be
            happy, fulfilled, and worthy, we must be better, do more, and
            accumulate as much material wealth as possible. Most of us move
            through our busy lives with our minds full of these ideas,
            multitasking as we strive to navigate the responsibilities and
            expectations we must meet just to make it through the day. But what
            if there is another way? What if, rather than letting the busyness
            of life overtake our minds, we learn to be <i>heartful</i> instead?
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on Daaji’s own combination of approaches and practices for the
            modern seeker—which draws from the teachings of Sahaj Marg, meaning
            “Natural Path”—Heartfulness is a contemporized version of the
            ancient Indian practice of Raja Yoga, a tradition that enables the
            practitioner to realize the higher Self within. While many books
            describe refined states of being, <i>The Heartfulness Way</i> goes
            further, providing a pragmatic course to experience those states for
            oneself, which, per the book’s guiding principle, is “greater than
            knowledge.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Heartfulness meditation consists of four elements—relaxation,
            meditation, cleaning, and prayer—and illuminates the ancient,
            defining feature of yogic transmission (or <i>pranahuti</i>), the
            utilization of divine energy for spiritual growth and
            transformation. Using the method, detailed practices, tips, and
            practical philosophy offered in this book, you’ll reach new levels
            of attainment and learn to live a life more deeply connected to the
            values of the Heartfulness way—with acceptance, humility,
            compassion, empathy, and love.

          and current spiritual guide of the global Heartfulness movement. His
          teachings arise from his personal experience on the path of

          for the world’s great spiritual traditions and scientific
          advancements.<br /><br />
          Daaji practiced pharmacy in New York City, NY, for over three decades

          masters. Fulfilling the many duties of a modern-day guru, he travels
          widely, extending his support to spiritual seekers everywhere. A
          self-professed student of spirituality, he devotes much of his time
          and energy to research in the field of consciousness and spirituality,
          approaching the subject with scientific methodology—a practical
          approach that stems from his own experience and mastery in the
          field.<br /><br /><b>Joshua Pollock </b>is a Heartfulness trainer and

          holding practical demonstrations in corporate, educational, and
          governmental settings; and providing ongoing individual support to
          local seekers. Pollock holds a bachelor of musical arts degree from
          Indiana University, and two master’s degrees from Guildhall School of
          Music and Drama in London, UK. He currently resides in India with his
