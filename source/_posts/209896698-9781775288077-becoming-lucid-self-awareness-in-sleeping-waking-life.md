            Are you frustrated that you are of the world and not in the world,
            and that it grinds on day by day without change? Would you like to
            recreate your reality? Do you think you could do this if you could
            wake up in your dreams? This is the topic of Becoming Lucid.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><br /></p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
            If you want to change your reality, the first thing you must find
            out is how it got to be the way it is. Until you become aware of
            what role you play in seeing, believing, and maintaining your
            reality you will not untangle what appears to be from what could be.
            Until you understand how you create your reality, no attempt at
            becoming lucid will be anything more than finding yourself in the
            same place.

          <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">
            Becoming Lucid is a transformation to a different state of mind.
            It's not your image of the walls that you want to dissolve, it's
            your image of the whole reality. Break open your mind to move into
            what's not yet comprehensible. This is not work just for sleep or
            dreams, it's life work.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first book to approach lucid dreaming through hypnosis.
            Each chapter's trance induction, accessed online as an MP3 audio
            file, offers you an altered state. Listen to these inductions while
            falling asleep and they will become your lucid dream environment.
            They will open the new reality.<br /><br />Drawn from the author's
            experience as a theoretical physicist, neurophysiologist, and
            hypnotherapist, Becoming Lucid would like to take your hand and lead
            you into states of mind you can't even imagine.
