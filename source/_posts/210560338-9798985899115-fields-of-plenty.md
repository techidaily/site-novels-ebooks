            Fields of Plenty is a guide to becoming conscious of what you are
            manifesting in your life - coming to know deeply your Soul's design
            and experiencing the plenty that results from this knowledge. Filled
            with practical direction on how to graduate from limited mind
            consciousness to a more expansive perspective of Soul
            identification, Fields of Plenty is a well drawn map to accessing
            your own native wisdom and, as a result, understanding how the
            things in your life manifest.

          "I was thoroughly enchanted reading Fields of Plenty. This book is an
          absolute gem and came to me at a time when I needed it most. It is
          filled with not only deep wisdom, but stories, tools, and techniques
          that make this an essential resource for personal growth "and, yes,
          liberation. Fields of Plenty is one of those books that embodies a
          quality of grace that is, in itself, a great blessing."

          "Readers will benefit from these startling quotes from Solano, which
          resonate as powerful touchstones throughout the book. The author's
          spiritual wisdom, both serious and playful, creates new footholds in
          the realm of spiritual thought, making distinctions between wisdom and
          fear, ego and soul."

        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          "I love Fields of Plenty! Through Solano's wisdom and LD's intuitive
          scribing of this profound material, the read is easy and rich. One
          can't help but to shift the paradigm for oneself even while reading as
          it instantly puts the reader in observer mode. From there, the reader
          will observe the old patterns as a well-trodden path of simply learned
          behavior. Use this book as a call to action, create a new path to
          feeling that sense of plenty that already is known to your soul."
