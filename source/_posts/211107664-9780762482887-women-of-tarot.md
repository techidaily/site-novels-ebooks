            >Discover the hidden stories of tarot and divination—traced through
            the lives and contributions of Lady Frieda Harris, Marie Anne
            Lenormand, Pamela Colman Smith, and Rachel Pollack—in this vividly
            illustrated popular history of the cards.&nbsp;</b
          ><br /><br />
          Tarot's storied history takes us from the highest circles of Italian
          Renaissance society through to present day card creators. And
          throughout that time, women have been the primary drivers of both
          artistic and magical innovation in the form, though they haven't
          always been given adequate credit for doing so. Now, for the first
          time, readers can explore the lives and work of some of the women who
          have brought us the word's most popular divinatory art.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          In&nbsp;<i>Women of Tarot</i>&nbsp;celebrated artist and author Cat
          Willett traces the lives of four women who have pioneered work in
          tarot and divination. There is Lady Frieda Harris, the nineteenth
          century British artist and mystic who created the Thoth Tarot with the
          occultist Aleister Crowley, and Marie Anne Lenormand, the most
          celebrated fortune teller of eighteenth century France, who brought
          card reading to the masses. Then readers will meet Pamela Colman
          Smith, the iconic cross-continental artist whose illustrations adorn
          the world's most popular tarot deck—the Rider-Waite-Smith Deck—and
          finally Rachel Pollack, the trans woman responsible for creating
          scores of decks in her lifetime, as she strove to make tarot an art
          that was inclusive of all practitioners, especially the LGBTQIA+
          community.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          Woven throughout is a timeline of the development of tarot, as well as
          miniature profiles of women from cultures around the world whose work
          has impacted divination and fortune telling, including Nefertiti,
          Voodoo Queen of New Orleans Marie Laveau, author Zora Neale Hurston,
          and contemporary artist Nanse Kawashima.&nbsp;

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Cat Willett </b>is a Brooklyn-based artist and author who holds an
          MFA in Illustration from the Fashion Institute of Technology. She
          received her BFA from the University at Buffalo with a minor in Art
          History and also studied at the Scuola Lorenzo de’Medici in Florence,
          Italy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She primarily works digitally, or with ink on paper, and her drawings
          depict plant life and strong female figures that are deeply rooted in
          history, with a bit of whimsy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her illustration work has been featured by Apple, Madison Square
          Garden, Doc Martens, the Museum of Arts and Design, and more.
