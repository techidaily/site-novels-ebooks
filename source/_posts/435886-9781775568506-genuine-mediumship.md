          <p>
            In reading this book we may begin to see that there is nothing
            "unnatural" in the hypothesis that there may be reports conveyed to
            the consciousness of man by means of higher vibrations than those of
            ordinary sound, or ordinary sight, providing that man has either
            highly developed his ordinary senses of sight, hearing, or touch to
            a degree sufficiently high to register these higher vibrations; or
            else has evolved and unfolded into consciousness certain latent
            faculties of sense-impression which are lying dormant in the great
            masses of mankind. In fact, the thoughtful person will be forced to
            admit that this new knowledge of the nature of sensations, and of
            its relation to vibratory motion, renders extremely probable the
            truth of the great body of reports of such so-called extra-conscious
            knowledge which the experience of the race has furnished from the
            beginning of human history down to the present time. Such a person
            will see that it is not a sign of "credulity" for a person to accept
            such reports, so universally set forth; but that, rather, it is a
            sign of "credulity" for a person to accept blindly the dogmatic
            assertions of the materialistic sceptics to the effect that "there
            is no such thing possible in the natural world, under natural world,
            under natural laws - the whole thing is delusion or else deliberate
            fraud." Such "know-it-all" persons are usually found to really "know
            much that is not true," and to lack knowledge of much that is true,
            regarding Nature, her realm and her laws.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us say that the student of this book will find nothing contained
            within this book which is contrary to Nature's laws and principles.
            He will nowhere in it be asked to suspend the exercise of his
            reason, and to accept as facts things which violate all of Nature's
            laws. Instead, he will find at each point full natural explanations
            of even the most wonderful phenomena; and the appeal to accept same
            will be made always to his reason, and not to his blind faith or
            unreasoning belief. The student is urged to build his knowledge of
            this important subject upon this solid rock of natural law and fact,
            and not upon the shifting and sinking sands of mere dogmatic
            assertion and appeal to assumed authority ancient or modern.
