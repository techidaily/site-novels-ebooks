          Reveals the Nazi-Reptilian infiltration of the U.S. government, their
          secret space program, and their slave colonies throughout the solar
          system <br /><br />• Details “Operation Paperclip,” which enabled
          Nazis and their Reptilian partners to infiltrate the U.S.
          military-industrial complex, including NASA and the CIA <br /><br />•
          Reveals their interstellar space ports in Antarctica and on Mars,
          their base on the Moon, and their alien technologies, including
          nano-technology, antigravity propulsion, mass mind control, and
          hyperdimensional teleportation capabilities <br /><br />• Shares
          testimonies from American and British “supersoldiers” who participated
          in the “20 and Back” age-regression programs, revealing advanced human
          technology and our Space Armada that constitutes a counter-balance to
          the Nazi Dark Fleet <br /><br />The Nazis did not really lose World
          War II. They made it appear that way in order to divert attention from
          the alliance between the Fourth Reich and the race of aliens known as
          the Reptilians--an ancient galactic civilization obsessed with
          conquest and domination. After the German surrender in 1945, the
          Nazi-Reptilian alliance infiltrated the U.S. military-industrial
          complex. Through “Operation Paperclip,” the Nazis and Reptilians
          removed their political opponents, such as the Kennedys, and moved
          into policy-making positions in post-war America, infiltrating
          aerospace companies, banking, media, and the U.S. government,
          including NASA and the CIA. But their real target was not the United
          States--it was the solar system. <br /><br />As Len Kasten reveals in
          startling detail--including revelations of antigravity propulsion
          technology, alien techniques of mass mind control, and
          hyperdimensional teleportation capabilities--the Nazi-Reptilian
          alliance used their newfound power, wealth, and influence to launch a
          Secret Space Program with interstellar spaceports in Antarctica and on
          Mars as well as an eleven-story base of operations on the Moon. They
          commenced mining and manufacturing operations on Mars and Ceres,
          forming colonies there and elsewhere in the solar system. And, most
          shocking, they have used thousands of human slaves, easily transported
          in their spaceships, for both work and sexual exploitation.
          <br /><br />Sharing testimonies from American and British
          “supersoldiers” who participated in the “20 and Back” age-regression
          programs, Kasten reveals the various forces inside and outside
          government that are resisting the Nazis and thwarting Reptilian
          attempts to achieve total dominance of the planet and the solar
          system. The U.S.-led Secret Space Program has its own fleet of
          spaceships, the Solar Warden Space Armada, which patrols the edges of
          the solar system and poses a growing threat to the Nazi Dark Fleet.

        <p>
          “In 1959, Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, the first head of Project Blue
          Book, wrote, ‘When WWII ended, the Germans had several radical types
          of aircraft and guided missiles under development. The majority were
          in the most preliminary stages, but they were the only known craft
          that could even approach the performance of objects reported by UFO
          observers.’ Len Kasten has taken this information a radical step
          forward with his concept that a race of Reptilians has infiltrated the
          military-industrial complex. In that case we could be doomed!”
