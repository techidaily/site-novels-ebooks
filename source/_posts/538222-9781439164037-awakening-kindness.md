            >Learn how to nurture and cultivate kindness, compassion, and love
            in ourselves and others in this “very joyous and deeply spiritual”
            (Betty Williams, Noble Peace Laureate) guidebook from the “dedicated
            student of the Dalai Lama” (Archbishop Desmond Tutu), Tibetan
            freedom fighter, and Grammy-nominated musician.</b
          ><br /><br />In Nawang Khechog’s view, one of the wonders of being
          human is that we can choose to nurture and cultivate kindness,
          compassion, and love. These precious values are the foundation of true
          happiness and are at the core of humanity’s possibility of peaceful
          coexistence with one another and with our environment.<br />
          <br />Based on his years as a monk studying Buddhist philosophy and
          meditation with the Dalai Lama, as well as his own highly regarded
          kindness workshops, <i>Awakening Kindness</i> details the many ways we
          can enrich our lives by simply being kind to each other and ourselves.
          Nawang shares a range of simple meditations, mantras, and practices
          that are easy to incorporate even into the busiest of lives.<br />
          <br />Covering the underlying philosophies of many cultures and
          religions, and touching on everything from human nature as it’s
          portrayed in film to scientific support of our limitless capacity for
          love and compassion, <i>Awakening Kindness</i> takes you on a
          life-changing journey that shows that we all can take part in creating
          a culture of kindness. “Anyone who picks up this book and is receptive
          to its message will immediately enjoy the many benefits of living in
          this simple and sacred way” (Richard J. Davidson, professor of
          psychology and psychiatry at University of Wisconsin-Madison).

        </h4>
        <p>
          Nawang Khechog was a monk for eleven years, including four years as a
          hermit meditator in the Himalayan foothills personally sponsored by
          His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Today he fills a truly unique spot in
          Buddhist culture as a teacher, performer, practitioner, and Tibetan
          freedom fighter, as well as being a Grammy-nominated musician who has
          sold several million of his albums worldwide. &nbsp;Having spent more
          than thirty years in India as a Tibetan refugee, Nawang now seeks
          strength and tranquility in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and
          continues sharing the value of universal kindness and compassion in
          workshops across the country.<br /><br />Tenzin Gyatso, the Fourteenth
          Dalai Lama, is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He
          frequently describes himself as a simple Buddhist monk. Born in
          northeastern Tibet in 1935, he was as a toddler recognized as the
          incarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and brought to Tibet's
          capital, Lhasa. In 1950, Mao Zedong's Communist forces made their
          first incursions into eastern Tibet, shortly after which the young
          Dalai Lama assumed the political leadership of his country. He passed
          his scholastic examinations with honors at the Great Prayer Festival
          in Lhasa in 1959, the same year Chinese forces occupied the city,
          forcing His Holiness to escape to India. There he set up the Tibetan
          government-in-exile in Dharamsala, working to secure the welfare of
          the more than 100,000 Tibetan exiles and prevent the destruction of
          Tibetan culture. In his capacity as a spiritual and political leader,
          he has traveled to more than sixty-two countries on six continents and
          met with presidents, popes, and leading scientists to foster dialogue
          and create a better world. In recognition of his tireless work for the
          nonviolent liberation of Tibet, the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel
          Peace Prize in 1989. In 2012, he relinquished political authority in
          his exile government and turned it over to democratically elected
          representatives.<br />
          <br />His Holiness frequently states that his life is guided by three
          major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular
          ethics in the interest of human happiness, the fostering of
          interreligious harmony, and securing the welfare of the Tibetan
          people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture, and
          religion. As a superior scholar trained in the classical texts of the
          Nalanda tradition of Indian Buddhism, he is able to distill the
          central tenets of Buddhist philosophy in clear and inspiring language,
          his gift for pedagogy imbued with his infectious joy. Connecting
          scientists with Buddhist scholars, he helps unite contemplative and
          modern modes of investigation, bringing ancient tools and insights to
          bear on the acute problems facing the contemporary world. His efforts
          to foster dialogue among leaders of the world's faiths envision a
          future where people of different beliefs can share the planet in
          harmony. Wisdom Publications is proud to be the premier publisher of
          the Dalai Lama's more serious and in-depth works.
