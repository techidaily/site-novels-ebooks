            ><i>Everything Is Here to Help You</i> offers an emotionally
            supportive way to shift out of the inner war of ego, and into the
            illuminated presence of your soul.<br /></b
          ><br />In this book, spiritual teacher and intuitive
          <b>Matt Kahn</b> redefines the spiritual path for the modern-day
          seeker, and offers original, innovative ways to resolve fear, unravel
          judgments, and learn how to view life from a clear, expanded
          perspective. By redefining our understanding of the spiritual journey
          from the point of view of the soul, Matt breathes fresh life into all

          <i>Everything Is Here to Help You&nbsp;</i>is a brilliant synthesis of
          insight, guidance, warmth, and wisdom that will open the heart and
          calm the mind. I loved every word, and will keep it close to my
          bedside as it has so much to offer I want to be able to sip its sweet
          wisdom often. It's a gift to yourself to read it.&nbsp;-&nbsp;Sonia
          Choquette, New York Times bestselling author of
          <i>Your 3 Best Super Powers</i><br /><br />Matt Kahn brilliantly nails
          it with&nbsp;<i>Everything Is Here to Help You</i>. By guiding us to
          see life as it really is, from a soul level, he reveals the phenomenal
          order of the Universe, our lives, and those things that challenge us,
          so that we may gain an upper hand, choosing to live deliberately and
          on purpose, loved and in love.&nbsp;-&nbsp;Mike Dooley,
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>Infinite Possibilities</i>&nbsp;and <i>Playing the Matrix</i
          ><br /><br />Somewhere in the dance between the ego and the soul is
          the truth of our wild ride here on earth. We are most in alignment and
          co-creative brilliance when the soul is driving the bus, but most of
          us are unwitting hostages while the ego drives us around revisiting
          all kinds of spots we'd rather not. Matt's beautiful book teaches us
          how to reassign the ego and elevate the soul. That is when our
          destiny, our true potential awakens-not just for the individual, but
          in service to the whole world. Highly recommended.&nbsp;-&nbsp;Colette
          Baron-Reid, bestselling author of <i>Uncharted</i><br /><br />I love
          Matt and I'm thankful for his existence. Grab this book and change
          your world.&nbsp;-&nbsp;Kyle Cease, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author of <i>I Hope I Screw This Up</i>
