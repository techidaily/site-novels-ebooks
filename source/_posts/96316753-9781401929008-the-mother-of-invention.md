            >A biography of a spiritual visionary, written by one of the great
            thinkers of our time<br /></b
          ><br />A&nbsp;biography unlike any other,
          <i>The Mother of Invention</i> tells the story of every human being
          now on the earth . . . through&nbsp;the telling of the life story of
          futurist and visionary Barbara Marx Hubbard.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are
          all moving through the same process, the book&nbsp;and its subject
          declare. It is the process of the birthing of our species. In what may
          very well be a new literary style, this biography begins in&nbsp;
          December 22, 2012,&nbsp;unraveling Barbara’s
          story&nbsp;backward&nbsp;to the date of her birth.
          <br /><br />Throughout the book are special sections&nbsp;inviting us
          to explore how we may directly apply what Barbara has observed and
          learned&nbsp;during&nbsp;her&nbsp;remarkable&nbsp;80-year journey . .
          . to our own daily lives. On this journey, we will witness Barbara as
          she became one of the first women ever to have her name placed in
          nomination for the vice presidency of the United States by a major
          political party, traveled to Russia as a cultural ambassador for
          peace, visited the Oval Office and&nbsp;asked the President a question
          that he could not answer, and developed a deep acquaintanceship with
          the American space program. Today, we continue to find her at the
          leading edge of contemporary thought and innovative action
          regarding&nbsp;our construction of the future. <br /><br />In a very
          real sense, the story of Barbara Marx Hubbard is the story of&nbsp;the
          future of all of us, rendering it one of the most relevant and
          compelling modern biographies of our time.

        </h4>
        <p>
          With an early interest in religion and a deeply felt connection to
          spirituality, Neale Donald Walsch spent the majority of his life
          thriving professionally, yet searching for spiritual meaning before
          beginning his now-famous Conversation with God series. These books
          have been translated into 37 languages, touching millions and
          inspiring important changes in people’s day-to-day lives. Seven of his
          27 books have reached the New York Times bestsellers list. Neale lives
          in Ashland, Oregon, with his wife, poet Em Claire. In 2001 he founded
          Humanity’s Team, which he describes as a worldwide civil-rights
          movement for the soul (www.HumanitysTeam.org). In 2005 he began work
          on putting into place a global education program, The School of the
          New Spirituality (www.SchooloftheNewSpirituality.com). In 2010 he
          created the CwG Spiritual Mentoring Program for individuals seeking to
          bring their highest spiritual understanding into their everyday lives.
