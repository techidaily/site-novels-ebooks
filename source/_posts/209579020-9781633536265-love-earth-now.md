            >How to live sustainably in an unsustainable society—and not let the
            world discourage your spirit.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Do you find yourself wondering what on Earth you can do about the very
          serious environmental challenges we face on our planet today? Do you
          worry there’s nothing any one person can do that will make a
          difference? Most people say that they would like to do something to
          make the world a better place, but they just don’t believe they have
          the time, energy, money, or power to make a real difference.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>Love Earth Now</i>&nbsp;invites us to explore our own
          thoughts and feelings about the challenge, and to check in with
          internal guidance about the waste and negative environmental impacts
          we see on a daily basis. While most of us can’t stop the Arctic
          icepack from melting, we can decide to make better choices like
          avoiding excessive packaging with our purchases, walking more and
          driving less, planting organic veggies in the front yard instead of a
          water-wasting lawn, and even going as green as possible at work and at
          home. Does your office lack a recycling and composting program? Do the
          research and start one yourself! Each chapter concludes with a “Diving
          In” section, a simple and immediate exercise, much like a guided
          meditation, to prompt us toward our own sustainable solutions.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          By practicing eco-mindfulness, we can discover that&nbsp;<i
            >one thing</i
          >&nbsp;we can do to make a difference today and for all our tomorrows.
          This is not only a source of inspiration but a sourcebook of direct
          actions—large and small—we can all take to ensure our children and
          their children’s children have a healthy future on this planet.
          Drawing from her experiences as an engineering geologist,
          environmental law attorney, small shop owner, and mindfulness
          practitioner, Cheryl Leutjen also reminds us about the importance of
          simplicity—and how all our possessions and the constant shopping for
          more are no better for us than they are for the planet itself,
          contributing to landfills and a tech-tethered society that is
          increasingly isolated. Both helpful and hopeful,<i
            >&nbsp;Love Earth Now</i
          >&nbsp;is brimming with creative suggestions that will get us closer
          to a sustainable lifestyle, one day at a time.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Cheryl Leutjen is a woman of many talents- geologist, environmental
          law attorney, small business owner, spiritual leaders, creative
          nonfiction writer, wife, mother and environmental activist. Her broad
          areas of study and wealth of experiences provide an integrated
          perspective of our place in the Universe, our purpose in being, and
          our relationship with our Mother Earth. Cheryl writes creative
          nonfiction essays sharing her experiences at the border between
          Earth-mindfulness and eco-madness, as she says “In the hope that my
          words may be of inspiration for anyone else who’s stumbling along the
          path of more conscientious living.” Cheryl lives in Los Angeles where
          she teaches, writes and leads workshops on the intersection between
          spirituality and the environment.
