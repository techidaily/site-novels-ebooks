            We are in this world, but not of this world. However, while we are
            here, let us strive to be the best and highest vibrational
            expression of ourselves that we can be. ~ Dawn James

          <p><strong>How to Clear Karma</strong></p>
          <p>
            Mirroring the style of Gary Zukav's&nbsp;&nbsp;The Seat of the
            Soul&nbsp;, this&nbsp;conversational literary masterpiece serves as
            a pathway to peace and personal liberty&nbsp;.&nbsp;Pulling back the

            What should have been a time of celebration and joy turned into a
            time of turmoil and fear for James.&nbsp;After surviving an
            attempted murder-suicide when she was six months pregnant, it took
            her 16 years to finally realize that she had not forgiven the person
            who tried to end her (and her unborn child's) life.&nbsp;<u
              >Choosing to use her pain as a pillar for greater purpose</u
            >, not only did she experience a "spiritual awakening" -&nbsp;making
            the conscious choice to forgive her offenders&nbsp;-But she made it
            her life's mission to teach others how to do the same.&nbsp;

She tells the reader how to empty the cup within that is filled with negativity and connect on a positive note with the world. The relationships we form define us and this book teaches us that by improving them and removing the toxic elements that can sour personal relationships.... She talks about forgiveness and Karma in a manner that can be understood simply. Too often we use crutches to mask our pain when we have the tools within us to heal naturally.
