          • Explains how Kimbanda’s presiding deity Eshu embodies both masculine
          and feminine principles, both god and devil, and thus represents human
          nature itself with all its vices and virtues <br /><br />• Discusses
          Kimbanda’s magical practices, initiation rites, sacred knives, and
          sacrificial offerings <br /><br />• Details the seven realms and the
          entities that inhabit and govern each of them <br /><br />Although it
          has been demonized as a form of Satanic cult, Kimbanda--the tradition
          of Afro-Brazilian black magic--is a spiritual practice that embraces
          both the light and dark aspects of life through worship of the
          entities known as Eshu and Pombajira. <br /><br />Exploring the
          history and practice of Kimbanda, also known as Quimbanda, Diego de
          Oxóssi builds a timeline from the emergence of Afro-Brazilian
          religions in the 17th century when African slaves were first brought
          to Brazil, through the development of Orisha cults and the formation
          of Candomblé, Batuque, Macumba, and Umbanda religious practices, to
          the modern codification of Kimbanda by Mãe Ieda do Ogum in the 1960s.
          He explains how Kimbanda’s presiding deity Eshu Mayoral embodies both
          masculine and feminine principles, both god and devil, and thus
          represents human nature itself with all its vices and virtues.
          <br /><br />Discussing the magical practices, initiation rites, and
          spiritual landscape of Kimbanda, the author explains how there are
          seven realms, each with nine dominions, and he discusses the entities
          that inhabit and govern each of them. The author explores spirit
          possession and Kimbanda’s sacrificial practices, which are performed
          in order to honor and obtain the blessing of the entities of the seven
          realms. He discusses the sacred knives of the practice and the role
          each plays in it. He also explores the 16 zimba symbols and sigils
          used to attract the spirits most apt to realizing the magician’s will
          as well as traditional enchantment songs to summon and work with those
          spirits. <br /><br />Offering an accessible guide to Kimbanda, the
          author shows that this religion of the people is popular because it
          recognizes the dark and light sides of human morality and provides a
          way to interact with the deities to produce direct results.
          <br /><br />DIEGO DE OXÓSSI is a Chief of Kimbanda and Orishas Priest.
          For more than 20 years he has been researching and presenting courses,
          lectures, and workshops on pagan and African-Brazilian religions. He
          writes a weekly column at CoreSpirit.com and is the publisher at Arole
          Cultural. He lives in São Paulo, Brazil.
