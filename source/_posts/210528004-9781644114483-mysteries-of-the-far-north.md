            >Presents evidence of early Norse settlement in Greenland and North
            America</b
          ><br /><br />• Explores in depth how Greenland and its surroundings
          were inhabited for nearly 5 centuries by two Nordic colonies,
          <i>Vestri-bygd</i> and <i>Eystri-bygd</i><br /><br />• Shares
          extensive evidence from the still-living indigenous oral tradition of
          the Far North as well as surviving sculptural art to show how the
          Vikings and the Inuit formed a harmonious community<br /><br />•
          Examines ancient maps and other cartography, such as the 15th-century
          Martin Behaim globe, as well as explorers’ records of their voyages<br /><br />Sharing
          his extensive and meticulous research, Jacques Privat reveals that the
          Vikings were in Greenland, its neighboring islands, and the eastern
          shores of Canada long before Columbus. He examines in depth how
          Greenland and its surroundings were inhabited for nearly five
          centuries by two Nordic colonies, Vestribygð and Eystribygð, which
          disappeared mysteriously: one in 1342 and the other in the 16th
          century. Drawing on the still-living indigenous oral tradition of the
          Far North, as well as surviving sculptural art carvings, he shows how,
          far from being constantly at odds with the native population, the
          Norsemen and the Inuit formed a harmonious community. He reveals how
          this friendly Inuit-Viking relationship encouraged the Scandinavian
          settlers to forsake Christianity and return to their pagan roots.
          <br /><br />Working with ancient European maps and other cartography,
          such as the 15th-century Martin Behaim globe, as well as explorers’
          records of their voyages, the author examines the English, Irish,
          German, Danish, Flemish, and Portuguese presence in the Far North. He
          explores how Portugal dominated many seas and produced the first
          correct cartography of Greenland as an island. He also reveals how
          Portugal may have been behind the disappearance of the Vikings in
          Greenland by enslaving them for their European plantations.
          <br /><br />Dispelling once and for all the theories that the Inuit
          were responsible for the failure of the Scandinavian colonies of the
          Far North, the author reveals how, ultimately, the Church opted to cut
          all ties with the settlements—rather than publicize that a formerly
          Christian people had become pagan again. When the lands of the Far
          North were officially “discovered” after the Middle Ages, the Norse
          colonies had vanished, leaving behind only legends and mysterious
          ruins.

          “The work of Jacques Privat forms a valuable contribution to our
          knowledge of the medieval history of the Scandinavians in Greenland.
          He introduces a new historical, geographical, and ethnographical
          vision. He offers new definitions of the relationship of this people
          with the church, the Inuit people, and the other nations of Europe.
          This book offers a new view of the disappearance of these Scandinavian
          settlers by freeing itself from the overly restrictive context of some
          earlier analyses.”
