            Born on a sugar plantation in Java at the turn of the 20th century,
            psychic, alternative healer, and writer Dora van Gelder Kunz was to
            become one of the most unique and unforgettable women of her age.
          </p>
          <p>
            This biography traces her life from her signs of clairvoyant ability
            in early childhood through her pioneering development, with Delores
            Krieger, of Therapeutic Touch; her presidency of the Theosophical
            Society in America; and, finally, her death at ninety-five.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among her several seminal books in the genre of modern esoteric
            literature are&nbsp;<i
              >The Real World of Fairies, The Personal Aura</i
            >, and&nbsp;<i>Spiritual Healing</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those who knew Dora were captivated by her blunt honesty, tremendous
            perception, deep compassion, and infinite capacity for hilarity. As
            this book lovingly chronicles, hers was indeed a most unusual life.

          "Dora van Gelder Kunz was a driving force in the worlds of alternative
          healing and Theosophy until her death in 1999. Dora had a privileged
          childhood, growing up on a plantation in Java, catered to by servants,
          yet isolated from other children. She ended her life in much simpler
          circumstances, having turned her attention to the practice of
          energetic healing and spirituality. She learned to meditate at the age
          of five and soon after began developing her clairvoyant abilities. She
          was a student of C. W. Leadbeater, and an associate of Krishnamurti
          and Geoffrey Hodson, to name just a few. At the forefront of what
          would eventually become the New Thought and New Age movements, her
          finely tuned mind and rational approach to the metaphysical world
          still sets the bar within the field. Best known for co-creating
          Therapeutic Touch with Delores Krieger, her influence in the early
          days of alternative healing far exceeds her notoriety. In addition to
          being an in-depth portrait of a woman who favored practicality and
          logical analysis over mysticism and phenomenon, this book is also a
          unique behind-the-scenes look into the early days of The Theosophical
          Society. Written by two people who knew her very well, it is a labor
          of love which demonstrates the same determination and attention to
          detail that was the hallmark of Dora van Gelder Kunz’s work. It will
          speak to a broad range of your customers on many levels. Let them know
          that Kunz was especially fond of nurses and worked closely with them
          during her healings." --<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>,
