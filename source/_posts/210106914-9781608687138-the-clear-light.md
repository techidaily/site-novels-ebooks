          As Eckhart Tolle has written, poetry “has been recognized since
          ancient times as a highly appropriate medium for the expression and
          transmission of spiritual truth.” The Clear Light is Steve Taylor’s
          latest contribution to this poetic tradition, offering short and
          powerful reflections as a guide to spiritual awakening and as
          experiential glimpses of the state of enlightenment itself. Taylor
          ranges widely, through subjects including “Making the Human Race
          Whole,” “Freedom from the Past,” and “The Reality of Connection,”
          always in clear and simple language. Best of all, he reminds us of the
          choices we always have when life feels chaotic and overwhelming:
          empathy, acceptance, and love. Soothing but also challenging, Taylor’s
          words continually affirm the profound bedrock of peace and even joy in
          the present that is always available. The book’s eponymous reflection
          says it best:<br />
          <br />
          There is nothing that can’t be undone —<br />
          no past injury that can’t be healed<br />
          no past mistake that can’t be corrected —<br />
          in the clear light of the present.<br />
          <br />
          Reading this book is a transformational spiritual experience in
          itself.<br />

          “A powerful and invaluable guide to the realization of who or what you
          are beyond the conditioned mind. If you read this book slowly,
          attentively, and repeatedly, it can take you beyond identification
          with the content of your mind and into the clear light of
          present-moment awareness.”<br />
          <strong>— Eckhart Tolle, from the foreword<br /> </strong><br />
          “Steve Taylor has gifted us with a collection of illuminating,
          heartful incantations, meditations, reflections, and above all, direct
          pointers to our nondual spiritual nature, in which all our unhealed
          suffering and trauma resolve in the ‘clear light of the present.’ This
          is a book to dip into and savor again and again.”<br />

          ><br />
          “Each poem in this book offers us a beautiful piece of wisdom. Steve
          Taylor writes with the quiet, humble assurance of a Zen master and
          also with sparks of the passion of Rumi and Hafiz. This book is an
          absolute must-read for anyone on a spiritual path in need of guidance
          on how best to live their daily life with mindfulness, heart, and
          equanimity.”<br />

            and Gateways to the Soul<br />
            <br /> </strong
          >“In this time of anxiety about the future, Steve Taylor brings us the
          gift of poetic meditations to rest deeply in the living, loving now.
          He invites us not just to rest but also to be openly compassionate and
          to live courageously. Keep The Clear Light close by to nourish your
          spirit.”<br />
