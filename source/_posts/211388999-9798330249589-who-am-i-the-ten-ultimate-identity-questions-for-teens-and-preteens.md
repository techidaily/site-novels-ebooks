          <p>
            The challenges that our children do face and will continue to face
            in the 21st century are enormous. The explosion of all manner of
            information on all platforms without discretion demands an urgent
            intervention on our parts as parents and ministers. Our Children
            have not only been entangled in the "World Wide Web/Internet" but
            have been thoroughly "raped".
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <strong>R A P E D! YES! R A P E D!</strong>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;<strong>R: RISKED:</strong> exposed to dangers of different
            magnitudes in the physical world
          </p>
          <p>
            and social media. Above all, to ideologies that are contrary to the
            Truth. Col
          </p>
          <p>2:8</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;<strong>A: ABANDONED:</strong> left to themselves because
            parents are too busy. Their
          </p>
          <p>questions are not answered as and when due.</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>P: PRESSURIZED:</strong> the children are under intense
            pressure from peers, from
          </p>
          <p>
            seducing spirits of the age and in the jungle of confusion in terms
            of choices to make. Many of them are simply unable to handle the
            pressures of life, so they become victims of pressure. They are
            doing many things in order to survive using the easy way out like
            drugs, sex, etc.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>E: ESTRANGED:</strong> alienated and isolated from the
            family, they are in the world of their own. They don't have
            affection for or attachment to family. They are withdrawn and are
            easily bored.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>D: DECEIVED:</strong> they are following another Jesus,
            another gospel and another spirit. 2 Cor. 11:3-4 They have become
            strange children with strange identities. Psalm 144:11. They remain
            immature and are not able to handle responsibilities commensurate
            with their ages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just picture in your mind being given a raped child to nurse back to
            life and health with the instruction, 'nurse this child for me, I
            will pay you'. Exo 2:9.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            What will you do? Will you run away telling yourself, 'This is too
            much responsibility or too bad, there is nothing I can do'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or will you choose to submit your fears and anxieties to God, join
            the rescue mission and trust Him to lend you His wisdom on the
            matter?
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This is the reason for this training manual on identity and much
            more. A great number of our children in the midst of the frightening
            emerging trends in the world
          </p>
          <p>
            system need adequate training in knowledge, values and skills. This
            will guarantee the discovery of their true identity and worth. It
            will also empower them to make righteous choices, identify risks in
            their environments, protect their sexual health and have the courage
            to nurture their leadership potentials for a successful adult/family
            life.
