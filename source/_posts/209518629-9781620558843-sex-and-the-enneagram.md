          Understanding your approach to dating, relationships, and sex through
          the lens of your Enneagram personality type <br /><br />• Explains the
          relationship and sexual differences in the 9 Enneagram personality
          types for both genders <br /><br />• Examines how we can create
          greater intimacy with our partners and what blocks our sexual
          enjoyment <br /><br />• Looks at each type’s fantasies and
          investigates how our behavior in relationships alters according to how
          emotionally integrated or disintegrated we are <br /><br />• Explores
          the three types of love and their countertypes; each type’s Enneagram
          Passions and Virtues in relation to intimacy; how to engage with each
          type; and whether some types make better lovers <br /><br />Sex can
          take us from the sacred sublime to the darkest aspects of humanity. It
          can carry us on the wings of pure pleasure, or crush and potentially
          destroy us. No act in the human experience, barring the essential
          survival needs of food and water, can have more of an effect on us.
          <br /><br />In <i>Sex and the Enneagram</i>, Ann Gadd explores
          relationships and sex through the lens of the Enneagram, its nine
          personality types, and the subtypes of the wings and Instinctual
          Triads. The author introduces the Enneagram system and provides a full
          chapter devoted to each type. She examines each type’s approach to
          sex, their fantasies, and levels of integration in relation to love
          and sex, as well as each type’s approach to issues such as
          pornography, sexual problems, and dating sites and whether some types
          make better lovers. The author explains the Enneagram Passions and
          Virtues of each type in relation to sex, divorce, wing influences, and
          gender and explains how the 27 Sub or Instinctual types and the
          Hornevian Triads of the Enneagram system affect our sexuality. Most
          importantly, Gadd looks at how we can heal ourselves sexually so we
          can create more fulfilling, transforming intimacy for ourselves and
          our partners. <br /><br />Through understanding ourselves and our
          partners sexually, with the help of the Enneagram, Gadd hopes to bring
          us to deeper levels of compassion and understanding for each other.
          Sex then can be an expression enhancing our love for each other,
          rather than simply a physical act. By understanding your own and your
          lover’s Enneagram type, intimate giving and receiving can be an
          empowering process to embody our love for ourselves and others.

        <p>
          “<i>Sex and the Enneagram</i> is an approachable presentation of the
          complex ways each Enneagram type may express or repress emotional
          openness in intimate relationships, and how deep-rooted issues of
          vulnerability, fear of self disclosure or shame, and lack of trust can
          cloud and limit our sexual selfexpression. In a warm, instructive, yet
          non-judgmental style, Ann also provides suggestions and reflections on
          ways an individual type might become more sexually, and therefore more
          completely, present to another in intimate connections. However, since
          we hold the potentials of all nine types within us, a studied
          consideration of each chapter in this book can collectively lead to a
          more abundant understanding and acceptance of the full range of our
          sexual lives and, in the process, to the even greater understanding
          that to be authentically present with another person serves to remind
          us, as Don Riso wrote, that we are always in the presence of the
          Divine.”
