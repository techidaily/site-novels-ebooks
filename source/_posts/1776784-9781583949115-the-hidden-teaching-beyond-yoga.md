          Inspired by his time spent with wise sages in Asia in the 1930s, Paul
          Brunton (1898-1981) wrote&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Teaching Beyond Yoga</i
          >&nbsp;(and its companion volume&nbsp;<i>The Wisdom of the Overself</i
          >) at the request of these remarkable teachers, who recognized that he
          had a significant role to play in the transmission of Hindu Vedanta
          and Buddhism to the West. Brunton's books are a profound re-creation
          of the teachings of those two philosophical schools of thought,
          informed by the insights of deep meditation. Clearly written without
          the specialized vocabulary found in those traditions, the books speak
          directly to the contemporary spiritual seeker.<br /><br /><i
            >The Hidden Teaching Beyond Yoga</i
          >&nbsp;is a step-by-step guide to actually experiencing the spiritual
          truth that reality is formed within our consciousness rather than
          outside us in the world of material things. Brunton's expert analysis
          of perception, grounded in science, is designed to awaken us to our
          sacred foundation and to transform our personality into a mirror of
          that reality. Brunton prepares us for this journey by describing the
          attitudes, mental disciplines, and character traits that are
          beneficial for success in this quest.<br /><br />This new edition has
          been updated to incorporate the author's final revisions and includes
          an introduction by the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foundation.<br /><br />Contents<br />Foreword

        <p>
          “Paul Brunton … has sought to throw a bridge across the chasm which
          separates yoga and pure ancient philosophy for searchers in the
          West.”<br />—<i>Dallas Times-Herald</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “… goes to the very roots of the mysteries of yoga and the mysteries
          of modern materialistic sciences.”<br /><i>—New Book Digest&nbsp;</i
          ><br /><br />“One has to acknowledge that many a student will be
          greatly indebted to Dr. Brunton for his assiduous work … should be
          carefully read and studied by everyone interested in the subject.”
          <br />—<i>The Seeker</i> [London]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This is the most mature of Paul Brunton's books and should reach a
          more deeply philosophic audience, as well as his previous circle of
          readers interested in the <i>Overself&nbsp;</i>… Brunton's function is
          to stimulate, to awaken consciousness of these problems in readers who
          would hesitate before the imponderables of Patanjali, Einstein, the
          sages of the East.”<br />—<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Mr. Brunton is an able writer, commanding an extensive range of
          reading. He manages to be bold and modest at the same time … his book
          is an introduction to critical thought, an approach to
          metaphysics.”<br />—<i>Review of Religion</i> [USA]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The book is crammed with telling yet sympathetic analyses of the
          shortcomings of the materialistic credo. In his latest book, Mr.
          Brunton is an entertaining, probing, and precise guide on a
          worth-while intellectual adventure.”<br />—<i>Republican</i>
          [Springfield, Mass.]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “As an antidote for today's confusion, this book will give the reader
          intelligent and practical help in his individual search for that which
          will enable him to surmount the difficulties confronting him in these
          troubled days.”<br />—<i>Book News</i> [Chicago]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>The Hidden Teaching Beyond Yoga</i> by Paul Brunton, which has
          fortunately been given to the world, very quickly impresses one with
          the writer's integrity, boldness, and sincerity.… From my privileged
          knowledge of the writer, I am convinced he is the possessor of this
          great truth, and therefore this work should prove to be a great
          blessing to all who seek The Truth.”<br />—<i>Psychic News</i>
          [London]

        </h4>
        <p>
          PAUL BRUNTON (1898-1981) is one of the twentieth century's most
          brilliant spiritual writers. Generally recognized as having introduced
          yoga and meditation to the West, he was the most popular and
          authoritative source of information on Eastern philosophies, gurus,
          and meditation systems from the mid-'30s to the '60s. His books have
          sold over two million copies in 17 languages.&nbsp;In 1954, he
          withdrew from public life and continued writing the material that was
          posthumously published as&nbsp;<i>The Notebooks of Paul Brunton</i>--a
          truly East-West spiritual philosophy. Written with the passion of an
          authentic pioneer and the thoughtfulness of a seasoned practitioner,
          his work is re-emerging as a beacon for all contemporary seekers.
