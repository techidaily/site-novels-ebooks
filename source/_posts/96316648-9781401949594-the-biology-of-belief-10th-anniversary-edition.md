          <b>Unleashing the power of consciousness, matter and miracles<br /></b
          ><br />It has been ten years since the publication of
          <i>The Biology of Belief</i>, Bruce Lipton’s seminal book on the
          relationship between mind and body that changed the way we think about
          our lives, our health, and our planet. During that time, research in
          this field has grown exponentially – Lipton’s groundbreaking
          experiments have now been endorsed by more than a decade of rigorous
          scientific study.<br /><br />In this greatly expanded edition, Lipton,
          a former medical school professor and research scientist, explores his
          own experiments and those of other leading-edge scientists that have
          unraveled in ever greater detail how truly connected the mind, body,
          and spirit are. It is now widely recognized that genes and DNA do not
          control our biology. Instead, they are controlled by signals from
          <i>outside</i> the cell, including energetic messages emanating from
          our thoughts.<br /><br />This profoundly hopeful synthesis of the
          latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics puts the
          power to create a healthy, joyous life back in our own hands. When we
          transform our conscious and subconscious thoughts, we transform our
          lives, and in the process help humanity evolve to a new level of
          understanding and peace.

          “I read <i>The Biology of Belief</i> when it first came out. It was a
          pioneering book and gave a much needed scientific framework for the
          mind/body/spirit connection. Bruce’s insights and research created the
          basis of the epigenetic revolution that is now laying the foundation
          for a consciousness-based understanding of biology. We are all
          indebted to him.”<br />— <b>Deepak Chopra, M.D., F.A.C.P.</b>,
          co-author with Rudolph Tanzi of Super Genes: Unlock the Astonishing
          Power of Your DNA for Optimum Health and Well-Being<br /><br />“Bruce
          Lipton’s book is the definitive summary of the new biology and all it
          implies. It is magnificent, profound beyond words, and a delight to
          read. It synthesizes an encyclopedia of critical new information into
          a brilliant yet simple package. These pages contain a genuine
          revolution in thought and understanding, one so radical that it can
          change the world.”<br />— <b>Joseph Chilton Pearce, Ph.D.</b>, author
          of <i>Magical Child</i> and <i>Evolution’s End<br /><br /></i>“Bruce
          Lipton’s delightfully written <i>The Biology of Belief </i>is a
          much-needed antidote to the ‘bottom-up’ materialism of today’s
          society. The idea that DNA encodes all of life’s development is being
          successfully employed in genetic engineering. At the same time, the
          shortfall of this approach is becoming evident.
          <i>The Biology of Belief&nbsp;</i>is a review of a quarter-century of
          pioneering results in Epigenetics, heralded by
          <i>The Wall Street Science Journal</i> in mid-2004 as an important new
          field. Its personal style makes it eminently readable and
          enjoyable.”<br />— <b>Karl H. Pribram, M.D., Ph.D., (Hon. Multi)</b>,
          professor emeritus, Stanford University<br /><br />“Dr. Lipton is a
          genius. His breakthrough discoveries give us tools for regaining the
          sovereignty over our lives. I recommend this book to anyone who is
          ready and willing to take full responsibility for themselves and the
          destiny of our planet.”<br />— <b>LeVar Burton</b>, actor and
          director<br /><br />“Bruce Lipton offers new insights and
          understanding into the interface between biological organisms, the
          environment—and the influence of thought, perception, and subconscious
          awareness—on the expression of one’s body healing potential.
          Well-referenced explanations and examples make this book a refreshing
          ‘must read’ for the student of the biological, social, and health care
          sciences. Yet the clarity of the author’s presentation makes it an
          enjoyable read for a general audience.”<br />—
          <b>Carl Cleveland III, D.C.</b>, President, Cleveland Chiropractic
          College<br /><br />“Dr. Lipton’s revolutionary research has uncovered
          the missing connections between biology, psychology, and spirituality.
          If you want to understand the deepest mysteries of life, this is one
          of the most important books you will ever read.”<br />—<b
            >Dennis Perman, D.C.</b
          >, co-founder, The Master’s Circle<br /><br />“In this
          paradigm-busting book, Bruce Lipton delivers a TKO to Old Biology.
          With a left to Darwinian dogma and a right to allopathic medicine, he
          breaks out of the physicalist box into enlightenment on the mind/body
          (belief/biology) system. Must read, much fun.”<br />—
          <b>Ralph Abraham, Ph.D.</b>, professor of mathematics, University of
          California; author of <i>Chaos, Gaia, Eros<br /><br /></i>“Powerful!
          Elegant! Simple! In a style that is as accessible as it is meaningful,
          Dr. Bruce Lipton offers nothing less than the long-sought–after
          ‘missing link’ between life and consciousness. In doing so, he answers
          the oldest questions and solves the deepest mysteries of our past. I
          have no doubt that <i>The Biology of Belief </i>will become a
          cornerstone for the science of the new millennium.”<br />—
          <b>Gregg Braden</b>, best-selling author of <i>The God Code </i>and
          <i>The Divine Matrix<br /><br /></i>“I finished reading this book with
          the same sense of profound respect I have when I am with Bruce
          Lipton—that I have been touched by a revolutionary sense of the truth.
          He is both a scientist and a philosopher; a scientist in that he
          provides us with tools toalter cultural consciousness and a
          philosopher because he challenges our beliefs about the very nature of
          our perceived reality. He is helping us create our own futures.”<br />—
          <b>Guy F. Riekeman, D.C.</b>, President, Life University and College
          of Chiropractic<br /><br />“<i>The Biology of Belief</i> is a
          milestone for evolving humanity. Dr. Bruce Lipton has provided,
          through his amazing research and in this inspiring book, a new, more
          awakened science of human growth and transformation. Instead of being
          limited by the genetic or biological constraints that humanity has
          been programmed to live by, humanity now has before it a way of
          unleashing its true spiritual potential with the help of simply
          transformed beliefs guided by ‘the gentle and loving hand of God.’ A
          definite must read for those dedicated to the mind/body movement and
          to the true essence of healing.”<br />— <b>Dr. John F. Demartini</b>,
          best-selling author of <i>Count Your Blessings </i>and
          <i>The Breakthrough Experience<br /><br /></i>“In a world of chaos,
          Dr. Lipton brings clarity to mankind. His work is thought-provoking,
          insightful, and will hopefully lead people to ask better quality
          questions in their lives and to make better decisions.One of the most
          exciting books I have read, this is a must read.”<br />—
          <b>Brian Kelly, D.C.</b>, President, New Zealand College of
          Chiropractic; President, Australian Spinal Research Foundation<br /><br />“Finally,
          a compelling and easy-to-understand explanation of how your emotions
          regulate your genetic expression! You need to read this book to truly
          appreciate that you are not a victim of your genes but instead have
          unlimited capacity to live a life overflowing with peace, happiness,
          and love.”<br />— <b>Joseph Mercola, D.O.</b>, Founder of mercola.com,
          the world’s most visited natural-health site<br /><br />“This book is
          an absolute must-read if you want to know, from a scientific
          viewpoint, that your lifestyle is in control of your health rather
          than your genetics. From a scientific viewpoint, Lipton demonstrates
          that the mind is more powerful than drugs to regain our health. The
          information reveals that your health is more your responsibility than
          just being a victim of your genes. When I started reading this book, I
          could not stop until it was finished.”<br />—
          <b>M. T. Morter, Jr., D.C.</b>, founder, Morter Health System;
          developer of the B.E.S.T. Technique<br /><br />“This is a courageous
          and visionary book that provides solid evidence from quantum biology
          to dispel the myth of genetic determinism—and implicitly, victimhood.
          Dr. Bruce Lipton brings a solid scientific mind to not only inform but
          to transform and empower the reader with the realization that our
          beliefs create every aspect ofour personal reality. A provocative and
          inspiring read!”<br />— <b>Lee Pulos, Ph.D., A.B.P.P.</b>, professor
          emeritus, University of British Columbia; author of
          <i>Miracles and Other Realities </i>and <i>Beyond Hypnosis</i
          ><br /><br />“History will record <i>The Biology of Belief </i>as one
          of the most important writings of our time. Bruce Lipton has delivered
          the missing link between the understandings of biomedicine of the past
          and the essentials of energetic healing of the future. His complex
          insights are expressed in a readily understandable fashion with a
          style that welcomes the scientist and the nonscientist on an equal
          footing. For anyone interested in health, the well-being of the
          species, and the future of human life, <i>The Biology of Belief </i>is
          a must-read. The implications of the perspectives outlined have the
          potential to change the world as we know it. Bruce Lipton’s
          understandings—and his concise expression of them—are sheer
          genius.”<br />— <b>Gerard W. Clum, D.C.</b>, President, Life
