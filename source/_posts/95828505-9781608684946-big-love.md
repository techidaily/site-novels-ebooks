            >Insights on life’s greatest challenges and how to meet them with
            love, from a survivor who writes with one-of-a-kind wit and wisdom —
            now in paperback with a new preface<br /></strong
          ><br />
          What happens when you fully commit yourself to love? Endless good,
          insists Scott Stabile, who found that out by overcoming plenty of bad.
          His parents were murdered when he was fourteen. Nine years later, his
          brother died of a heroin overdose. Soon after that, Stabile joined a
          cult that dominated his life for thirteen years before he summoned the
          courage to walk away. In Big Love, his insightful and refreshingly
          honest collection of personal essays, Stabile relates these profound
          experiences as well as everyday struggles and triumphs in ways that
          are universally applicable, uplifting, and laugh-out-loud funny.
          Whether silencing shame, rebounding after failure, or moving forward
          despite fears, Stabile shares hard-won insights that consistently
          return readers to love, both of themselves and others.<br />

        <p>
          “Has there ever been a more crucial time for Big Love to be released
          into our world? Scott Stabile is one of my favorite love artists and
          activists. His voice in this vital new book is fresh and relevant —
          his message urgent and universal. Scott is a force for love in a time
          when we are all desperate for healing. I look to Scott for wisdom and
          leadership, and he has delivered both with Big Love. This book opened
          my heart and mind, and I’m forever grateful.”<br />
          <strong>— Glennon Doyle, </strong>author of the #1 New York Times
          bestseller Untamed<br />
          <br />
          “Scott Stabile is a wonderful presence of love, advocacy, warmth,
          resilience, and grace in our world. I adore and admire everything he
          creates.”<br />
          <strong>— Elizabeth Gilbert, </strong>bestselling author of Eat, Pray,
          Love<br />
          <br />
          “A must-read for anyone wanting to figure out how to authentically
          show up for your life (for better or worse). . . . It’s never about
          those treacly, saccharine “just stay positive” admonitions. . . . In
          fact, the book is funny as hell.”<br />
          <strong>—</strong><strong> The Advocate</strong><br />
          <br />
          “At the end of life, the core question we ask is, Was I well loved and
          did I love well? Scott Stabile doesn’t wait to ask this fundamental
          question — love is already the center of his solar system. Big Love is
          an operating manual for living a heart-centered life in good times and
          bad. I’ve never read a more poignant and powerful ode to the power of
          love.”<br />
          <strong>— Chip Conley, </strong>bestselling author of Peak and
          Emotional Equations<br />
          <br />
          “In Big Love, Stabile isn’t afraid to let his vulnerability show while
          reflecting on his own journeys of excavating buried pain,
          acknowledging fear, finding paths towards forgiveness (including from
          ourselves), living authentically and developing resilience. He offers
          a sincere blend of honesty and humor while replacing platitudes with
          perspectives grounded by individual experiences.”<br />
          <strong>— Shelf Awareness</strong><br />
          <br />
          “Big Love, big heart, big opportunity to bring way more love into your
          life and consciousness with buoyancy, beauty, and boldness. Infinite
          love to Scott Stabile for bringing this everloving book into
          being.”<br />
          <strong>— SARK, </strong>artist and coauthor of Succulent Wild Love<br />
          <br />
          “Big Love is a fast and enjoyable read marked with philosophical,
          ethical and spiritual points woven into a very personal account. To
          quote Stabile directly: ‘Love makes life better. Love heals.’ Few
          people probably understand that better&nbsp;than the author
          himself.”<br />
          <strong>— Spirituality Today</strong><br />
          <br />
          “Big Love is heartbreaking, hilarious, and entirely real. I saw parts
          of myself in every one of Scott’s stories, and that is perhaps the
          greatest gift of this book — that he writes so openly about the
          struggles so many of us experience but hesitate to express, and he
          does so with incredible compassion, insight, and authenticity.”<br />
          <strong>— Mike Robbins, </strong>author of Be Yourself, Everyone Else
          Is Already Taken<br />
          <br />
          “Big Love is one of those rare gems that spares us the pretension of
          light-and-fluffy love rhetoric and instead truly guides readers in how
          to love themselves and others without holding back. Thank you for this
          gift, Scott.”<br />
          <strong>— Chris Grosso, </strong>author of Indie Spiritualist,
          Everything Mind, and Dead Set on Living<br />
          <br />
          “Big Love does something that many books strive for but fail to
          achieve. It cracks open the happy image of its author, Scott Stabile,
          and reveals the heartbreaking, life-altering realities that have
          shaped this man and what he teaches. Leading by example with this
          book, Scott shows what it means to live wide open and how
          vulnerability is true power.”<br />
          <strong>— Jacob Nordby, </strong>author of Blessed Are the Weird: A
          Manifesto for Creatives<br />
          <br />
          “Big Love isn’t simply about making a choice to be kind,
          compassionate, respectful and loving. At its core it all comes down to
          forgiveness.”<br />
