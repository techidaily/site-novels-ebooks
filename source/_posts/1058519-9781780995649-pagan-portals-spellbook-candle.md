          Curses have given the world some of its greatest legends and folklore,
          and the more grisly and gory, the better we like them. But cursing, or
          ill-wishing, is not a practice confined to magical practitioners -
          black, white or grey - it is a form of expression intended to do harm
          in reparation for some real or imagined insult and can be ‘thrown’ by
          anyone of any race, culture or creed without any prior experience of
          ritual magic or witchcraft. According to the dictionary, however, a
          curse is defined as: To invoke or wish evil upon; to afflict; to damn;
          to excommunicate; evil invoked on another person. If this is the clear
          definition, then under what circumstances can we challenge this
          established way of thinking and ask ourselves can cursing ever be
          justified? And if we hesitate for just a moment, then we must ask the
          next question: Is cursing evil? Like all aspects of life, however, it
          is advisable to put things in their proper perspective before passing
          judgement.<br />

          (Lincolnshire) and the Cheltenham Literature Festival. The original
          idea for the From the Editor’s Desk workshops was taken from her
          creative writing book of the same name, with both proving to be highly
          popular with writers’ groups. As a result of a successful series of
