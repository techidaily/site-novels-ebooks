            Samuel Johnson explained "Genius is that energy which collects,
            combines, amplifies and animates!" Here is a collection of first
            person stories told by animated people who amplified the Genius
            river flowing into their minds.<br /><br />
            Each chapter is written by a fascinating person of achievement. When
            they faced crises, they found "the latch on the door of Genius,
            flinging open their channel. Like Saint Francis who prayed "Oh Lord,
            let me be a channel!" - each one let great creative ideas sweep into
            their lives.<br /><br />
            How did they do it? How did they find and apply the genius ideas!
            What then happened to them because of GENIUS?<br /><br />
            All this and much more is spelled out to you in their first person
            stories in this powerful book.<br /><br />
            It will change your life. It will lift up your spirit. It will show
            you how you too can tap the GENIUS river!<br /><br />
            Longfellow explained "All the means of action, the shapeless masses,
            the materials, lie everywhere about us. What we need is the
            celestial fire to change the flint into transparent crystal - bright
            and clear. That fire is GENIUS."

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dottie Walters began her business by pushing her two small children
          before her on a baby stroller with a rickety wheel. When it fell off
          she grabbed her shoe and gave it a whack. No jobs were open to her in
          a recession period. She had nothing but a high school education, no
          car, and a mountain of debts. Pulling from the inspiration of her high
          school English teacher who had insisted she take journalism, Dottie
          trod dusty roads in her rural community to find the Baldwin Park
          Bulletin office. "There are no jobs!" she was told. But at that moment
          she turned her life around. "Then sell me Ad space!" she pleaded.
          After the newspaper staff agreed, she asked for the first week's space
          on credit. Then began the long journey, selling advertisements to the
          local merchants. Grasping Every idea she could see, Dottie educated
          herself by reading biographies, six or seven each week. The
          advertising business grew. She was asked to speak for service clubs.
          Today her advertising business spans five counties, with four offices.
          Four thousand merchants use the services of Hospitality Hostess, a
          welcoming company. Dottie has spoken across the United States, Canada
          and England. She has been featured on national television, radio and
          numerous newspaper features.
