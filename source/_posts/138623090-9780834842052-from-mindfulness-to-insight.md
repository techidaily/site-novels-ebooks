            >Building on mindfulness and self-compassion practices, this
            step-by-step guide to secular insight meditation shows the way to
            freedom from deeply rooted thought patterns.</b
          ><br /><br />Discover joy within yourself and heartfelt connection
          with others by releasing the habitual thought patterns that cause
          suffering and alienation. Drawing on Buddhist wisdom as well as the
          latest research in psychology and neuroscience, this book provides you
          with the tools needed to recognize the habits of thinking that fuel
          anger, desire, jealousy, and pride. Building on mindfulness and
          self-compassion practice, it offers a step-by-step series of guided
          meditations that create the conditions for liberating insight and
          wisdom to naturally arise. Thousands of people in the last decade have
          benefited from practicing the exercises in this book, which were
          developed and taught as part of the curriculum at the Mindfulness
          Association, an organization founded to deliver training in
          mindfulness, compassion, and insight.

          "This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to understand
          mindfulness from a traditional Buddhist perspective and how to go
          beyond it and harness the transformative power of insight meditation.
          There are lots of great tools and strategies in here for anyone who
          wants to wake up, live more consciously, and actively build a richer
          and more fulfilling life." —Dr. Russ Harris, author of&nbsp;<i
            >The Happiness Trap</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>ACT Made Simple<br /></i><br />"Nairn, Choden, and
          Regan-Addis cogently and compellingly present some 2,500 years of the
          Buddha’s teachings as well as the research in neuroscience and
          evolutionary psychology that speak to the veracity of these teachings.
          The path they set out before us has the power to bring more freedom
          into our minds and restore a sense of interbeing to our lives."
          —Sharon Salzberg, author
          of&nbsp;<i>Lovingkindness</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Real Happiness<br /></i
          ><br />"With sparkling clarity, this book shows how to use the
          profound essence of mindfulness as a path to lasting contentment and
          inner peace. It integrates traditional teachings with cutting-edge
          neuroscience while being encouraging and full of practical
          suggestions. Deep, penetrating, and far-reaching, it offers remarkable
          insights on every page." —Rick Hansen, PhD, author of&nbsp;<i
