            <i>The bridge from Maiden to Mother has been broken. </i
            ><br />&nbsp;<br />When the goddess culture was stolen and buried,
            so too were women’s rites of passage into our wild, intuitive
            femininity and maturity.<br />&nbsp;<br />With
            <i>Maiden to Mother</i>, Sarah Durham Wilson excavates these ancient
            rites, guiding us through a sacred and crucial initiation from the
            immature Maiden into the archetypal Mother—the powerful, safe,
            compassionate, full-bloom feminine life force that exists within all
            of us.<br />&nbsp;<br />Becoming the Mother is every woman’s
            birthright—regardless of whether or not she raises children. The
            Mother is who we needed as a child, who we were meant to be in this
            life, and who the world needs us to be now.<br />&nbsp;<br />Wilson
            teaches that while pre-patriarchal cultures honored women’s natural
            cycles, today’s society infantilizes women, idolizing youthful
            traits such as “pretty, pleasing, and polite” in order to keep us
            distracted and dependent. While a healthy version of the Maiden will
            always remain part of us, there comes a time when we must no longer
            let her wounds and immaturity guide our lives. We must step into our
            mature, feminine fullness.<br />&nbsp;<br />In this journey, you
            will travel with Inanna—the ancient Sumerian goddess who ventured
            through the Underworld to meet her severed, dark sister and emerged
            fully integrated and empowered, giving us an archetypal map to inner
            strength and wholeness.<br />&nbsp;<br />Through personal stories,
            rituals, teachings, and practices, Wilson helps women heal the
            Mother Wound and dismantle our internalized patriarchy with its
            false, constricting standards for the feminine, so we may live with
            authenticity and feast on the richness of life. “Midlife is not, as
            our culture proposes, where a woman’s power ends,” writes Wilson,
            “but where it really begins.”

          “Sarah provides deep wisdom and guides us along the most important
          journey of our lives, from maiden to mother. This book is exactly what
          the feminine in each and every one of us needs in order to fully step
          into our fullest expression and our greatest power.” —<b
            >LeAnn Rimes,</b
          >
          internationally acclaimed singer, songwriter, and Grammy® Award
          winner<br /><br />“I remember when I was at home giving birth to my
          first child, Brave. I had just begun active labor. I started to panic
          and call for my mother, Davi. My midwife came close and said, ‘You are
          the mother now.’ It was a powerful moment, an awakening. I was forced
          to let go of my maiden, ready or not. So many of us are thrust into
          Mother with nary a blueprint to guide us. Unmothered ourselves, this
          can be treacherous terrain. Sarah brings her gentle and deep wisdom to
          walk us through the ancient rites lost to us. Her words have helped
          me, and now they will help you.” —<b>Cree Summer,</b> actress and
          singer<br /><br />“<i>Maiden to Mother</i> is a timely and powerful
          book for all women to read and engage with. This time in history is
          what I call the ‘Sophia Century’—a century that will be defined by the
          rising, maturing, and full self-expression of the feminine in women
          and also in men. Read this book, engage with the beautiful ideas in
          this book, and then find your wings and SOAR!” —<b>Lynne Twist,</b>
          bestselling author of <i>The Soul of Money</i><br /><br />“The words
          and teachings that Sarah shares so generously with the world are
          forged in the fire and heat of her fully lived experience. Vital and
          vulnerable, strong and tender, Sarah is a mystic, a wise woman, and a
          way-shower, and she will take you on an initiatory journey to deeply
          meet yourself, to navigate the terrain of womanhood, and to claim your
          power and presence. I hold Sarah in the deepest reverence. She, and
          all that she shares in the world, is fierce, much-needed medicine for
          us all.” —<b>Lisa Lister,</b> bestselling author of <i>Witch</i> and
          <i>Code Red</i><br /><br />“At the heart of Sarah’s book and work is a
          returning to ourselves in a society that has, in so many ways,
          attempted to pull us away from our essence. The work of
          <i>Maiden to Mother</i> invites us to remember, return to, and
          reawaken who we are underneath the conditioning we’ve received, in
          order to show up more fully, vibrantly, and wholly in our lives and
          within ourselves. This book is a balm, a gift, a mystical weaving of
          wisdom, and a nurturing companion that will ignite healing for so
          many.” —<b>Lisa Olivera,</b> author of <i>Already Enough</i
          ><br /><br />“Only Sarah Durham Wilson could make this tale so moving,
          so funny, so open, and so soulful, in words that sparkle like a love
          song. In <i>Maiden to Mother</i>, she goes intimately deep into grief,
          heartbreak, and spiritual rebirth. It’s a bravely personal but
          universal guide to exploring the dark places of the heart and finding
          fresh wisdom there.” —<b>Rob Sheffield,</b> contributing editor at
          <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author<br /><br />“Sarah
          Durham Wilson is giving voice and vocabulary to a swelling movement of
          people who want to cast off the inheritance of patriarchy but haven’t
          seen a clear alternative. Reclaiming the feminine in all of her phases
          is the vital work Durham Wilson is engaged in, and I am thrilled that
          she’s chosen to share it with us.” —<b>Caterina Scorsone, </b
          >actress<br /><br />“In a world that worships the maiden, this
          beautiful book is an invitation to move into the archetype of Mother,
          which is the most profound gift we can offer ourselves, our inner
          child, the earth, and the collective.” —<b>Ruthie Lindsey,</b> speaker
          and author of
          <i>There I Am: The Journey from Hopelessness to Healing</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Maiden to Mother</i> is part archetypal medicine and
          part map for a woman’s brave and loving return to a whole and healed
          self. Sarah Durham Wilson suffered a mother wound that nearly crushed
          her, and she has risen up and courageously found her way home to her
          own heart.” —<b>Sil Reynolds, RN,</b> author of
          <i
            >Mothering and Daughtering: Keeping Your Bond Strong Through the
            Teen Years</i
          ><br /><br />“Sarah Durham Wilson delivers a confronting and
          enlivening challenge to men and women in this book—challenging men to
          examine how they perpetuate the ‘forever maiden’ syndrome, while
          offering women a clear and truly needed path of excavation,
          integration, and liberation.” —<b>John Wineland,</b> men’s group
          facilitator, speaker, teacher, and author of <i>From the Core</i
          ><br /><br />“Sarah Durham Wilson guides, teaches, and writes from an
          embodied place of having journeyed into the dark depths. Over the
          years of knowing her, I have seen this extraordinary witch enter deep
          communion with the Mother archetype, tending a most sacred
          relationship and thus feeding Her true force—so often forgotten by
          modernity. An offspring of her intimate soul journey is this book, and
          ultimately a contribution to the healing and resurrection of the Great
          Mother Goddess Creatrix energy so needed on our planet at these times.
          Sarah reminds us that it is by awakening, embodying, and living from
          the wholeness of the Mother archetype within us that the powerful love
          of Goddess will take her rightful place upon the living Earth.”
