            >AN INSPIRATIONAL MEDITATION ON THE POWER OF CONSCIENCE—HOW A SIMPLE
            ACT, A MOMENT OF PURPOSE, CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE, YOUR COMMUNITY, EVEN
            THE WORLD</i
          ><br /><br />We all struggle at times to know what to do to seek and
          abide our conscience—when right and wrong are not black and white,
          when heart and head speak with different voices, when our intentions
          and interests are not aligned. If you believe that the outcome of
          these struggles affects the course of your life, and the lives around
          you, then this book is for you.<br />If you believe that there are
          times and places when the choice an individual makes to speak or be
          silent, to eat or fast, to remain seated or to stand up in a crowd, to
          stare and remember or to walk on by and forget, can be as powerful as
          a president’s command, a congressional appropriation, or a military
          incursion, then this book is for you.<br /><br />This book is for you
          if your profession is rewarding financially but not spiritually, or if
          you’re ever worried that your career and conscience conflict.<br /><br />This
          book is for you if you are a parent whose love of your children never
          wavers with the anxiety they cause you but sometimes leaves you
          wondering whether they will grow up to do the right thing even if no
          one is watching.<br /><br />This book is for you if you question
          whether the countless small decisions you make each day add up to a
          larger judgment about your life’s meaning.<br /><br />Finally, this
          book is for you if you believe that quiet, often solitary acts of
          conscience have echoes louder than the original sound; that individual
          acts have the potential to trigger large public consequences and
          continue to inspire others from generation to generation; that such
          acts bring rewards to the individual, that unforeseen benefits accrue,
          that one gains more than was sacrificed, and that there is a
          transformative power and richness to a life so lived.

          Praise for Bill Shore's
          <b>The Cathedral Within</b>:<br /><br />“Simply revolutionary.”
          <br />—Mary McNamara, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br /><br />“<b
            >The Cathedral Within</b
          >
          is a reminder that what really counts in our lives and in our
          communities is the enduring value of giving back and helping others.
          Bill Shore is a true American visionary, whose written prescription
          for how we can all give something back is both inspiring and
          enlightening. This book can change both human lives and organizational
          lives for the better.”<br />—Colin L. Powell<br /><br />“<b
            >The Cathedral Within</b
          >
          is a clarion call in this time of compassion fatigue, a compelling and
          convincing plea for us to reconsider the way we approach problems of
          hunger and poverty.” <br />—Richard Russo, Pulitzer Prize–winning
          author of <b>Empire Falls</b><br /><br />“Bill Shore has done the
          impossible: written a social policy book that is a page-turner.
          Peppered with stories whose wit and wisdom delight us as they inform
          and inspire us, <b>The Cathedral Within</b> celebrates the human
          spirit. This book is mandatory reading for all who struggle against
          the odds to fashion a better future for all of America’s children.”
          <br />—Lisbeth Shorr, author of <b>Common Purpose</b>
