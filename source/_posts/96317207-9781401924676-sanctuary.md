            >More than half a century after Einstein first described the
            energetic unity of the world in his famous equation, E=mc2, we are
            finally beginning to understand the spiritual and mystical
            implications of his discovery. <br /></b
          ><br /><i>Sanctuary: The Path to Consciousness</i> is about the
          miraculous possibilities that emerge when we see the universe as a
          matrix of frozen light, the spiritual manifestation of our intuitive
          consciousnesses. In this remarkable novel, you will find a new
          energetic model of the body, the spirit, and the nature of the
          physical world. It points the way to unlimited possibilities of
          absolute, eternal transformation, and you will find out that it is
          readily available now! <br /><br />After reading this book, you too
          can take advantage of the techniques of energetic
          Quantum-Consciousness Evaluation, and be able to identify and remove
          subtle-energy imbalances to attain and integrate physical, emotional,
          and spiritual harmony!

          “In regard to Stephen Lewis, EMC2, and the AIM
          Program:&nbsp;Everything is energy. Everything and everyone has a
          frequency.Those frequencies that are out of balance with our natural
          harmony can be identified and removed. I know this to be true.
          I&nbsp;have seen the <i>Sanctuary</i> process at work. I practice it
          daily. Myentire family participates in the AIM Program, and I have
          seenwonderful results. This is real, it is transforming, it is true
          heal-ing, and it is a giant step into the inevitable future where
          eachof us is our own personal, transcendental, and totally
          enlight-ened healer. I have found that in my higher self, and so
          canyou. It is available now.”<br /><b>— Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</b
