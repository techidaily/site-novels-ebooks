            >For the thousands of people who loved <i>To Heaven and Back</i>,
            <i>Heaven is for Real</i>,&nbsp;and <i>Proof of Heaven</i>,<br />a
            warm and detailed account of life between lives—and our lives to
            come</b
          >&nbsp;<br />What happens when someone dies? What does it feel like?
          What exactly is the light at the end of the tunnel? Is reincarnation
          real? And if so, do spirits have any influence over their lives to
          come?<br />&nbsp;<br />Based on his own amazing experiences
          communicating with those who have passed over, Barry Eaton answers
          these questions about the spirit world, and many, many more. Taking
          the reader on a journey through the realm of the spirit, the author
          details the whole process of crossing into the next life, from the
          journey “home,” to adapting to new living conditions in the afterlife,
          and even delving into what kinds of activities will be available
          there, and how we can be prepared for our own personal journey.<br />&nbsp;<br />This
          book will give hope, alleviate fear, and provide comfort for anyone
          who has questions or concerns about life after death.

          “Eaton’s <b>Afterlife</b> is concise and detailed, covering
          considerable ground on the subject of life after death, without being
          overwhelming or heavy… Every reader will find something to connect
          with in this book or open up completely to new ideas.”<br /><b

          didn’t die and comeback as is most commonly the inspiration of those
          that tell their stories (called NDE’s or near death experiences). He
          experienced a previous life, his death in that life, the afterlife
          that followed and his birth into this life.
