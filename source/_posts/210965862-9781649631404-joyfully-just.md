              >Liberating meditation practices drawn from Black cultural
              traditions and Buddhism to bring forth courage, transform grief,
              defeat injustice, and manifest joy</b
            ><br /><br />Many of us have come to think about justice as a
            “struggle,” a cause to fight for in the world. But what if the work
            of justice begins within? What if there were a way to find joy in
            the journey toward justice?<br /><br />With <i>Joyfully Just</i>,
            Dr. Kamilah Majied offers an inspiring and unique approach to
            overcoming injustice with joy, courage, and playful curiosity. She
            shares many of the insights and experiences that gave rise to her
            leadership as a joyful champion of contemplative approaches to
            mental health and social justice.<br /><br />Drawing on timeless
            wisdom from Buddhism and Black traditions, Majied invites us to play
            with different ways of being just toward ourselves and all life
            around us. Here, we discover how to:<br /><br />• Play with creative
            and artistic practices to develop critical consciousness and become
            more mindful, inclusive, and anti-racist<br />• Explore language as
            a pathway to liberation and justice<br />• Unlearn and heal from
            white supremacy, internalized racism, and other forms of oppression
            and bias<br /><br />By engaging with these practices, we are able to
            access the freedom that comes with tearing off the restrictive
            habits of privilege and internalized oppression as we allow our
            bodies, hearts, minds, and souls to be liberated, unafraid, and
            agentive in the world.

          “Powerful teachings in a powerful voice on every page. This book
          arrives just in time to reboot and expand our collective understanding
          of what an inclusively human, multicultural, multiracial dharma, in
          all its universals and in all its beautifully differentiated ancestral
          and cultural particulars, might look like. I will be living inside
          this book for a long, long time.” —<b>Jon Kabat-Zinn, </b>author of
          <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i><br /><br />“In a world so marked by
          social hierarchies, oppression, and violence,
          <i>Joyfully Just</i> stands as a beacon of hope and a call to action.
          Dr. Majied’s approach to social justice is a refreshing and powerful
          reminder that when we start within, we can create a more equitable and
          compassionate world for ourselves and others. This book is a must-read
          for anyone seeking a path to personal and collective liberation.” —<b
            >Tara Brach</b
          >, author of <i>Radical Acceptance</i> and <i>Trusting the Gold</i
          ><br /><br />“In <i>Joyfully Just</i>, Dr. Majied offers a creative
          and liberative masterpiece, a pulsing testament to the richness and
          strength of Black wisdom and Buddhism, dancing together for the
          greater good. A book to savor, celebrate, and share broadly.” —<b
            >Ruth King</b
          >, author of <i>Mindful of Race</i><br /><br />“Reading this book, I
          threw my arms in the air and said, Yes! Kamilah Majied offers us a
          powerful gift: a reminder that in order to bend the arc we need fierce
          compassion, love, and, yes, joy to move us to action, sustain our
          commitment, and stay strong. Her refreshing understanding of justice
          includes everyone, even that often overlooked one—ourself. She holds
          up a wide range of contemplative practices from Buddhist and Black
          traditions that help us get there: dance, music, poetry, and story as
          well as meditation and prayer. Just reading this book will move you to
          joyful action.” —<b>Mirabai Bush,</b> founder of The Center for
          Contemplative Mind in Society, author of
          <i>Walking Each Other Home</i> (with Ram Dass) and
          <i>Contemplative Practices in Higher Education</i> (with Daniel
          Barbezat)<br /><br />“This book is a deep-wisdom treasure. Kamilah
          intimately brings the reader into the heart of white supremacy,
          clearly pointing out its blinders and harms, while introducing
          practices to awaken and liberate us all. Simultaneously, she rekindles
          the joy at the heart of this freedom, bringing a wholeness that
          animates the heart and moves the body. Leading us to look personally
          into our losses, she reminds us that gratitude and enjoyment of life
          are essential elements of grieving well, returning us to love.” —<b
            >Judith Simmer-Brown,</b
          >
          Naropa University<br /><br />“Brimming with creative and illustrative
          insights and connections, Kamilah Majied’s <i>Joyfully Just </i>shows
          us what I have long thought to be true: that combining Black wisdom
          with Buddhist insights presents us with a rich tapestry of what is
          actually possible, namely, that there can be deep joy in the midst of
          suffering even as we strive toward liberation. <i>Joyfully Just</i> is
          a soulful and heartful guidebook for coming to know, and hence for
          bringing forth, our innate joy and for expanding that joy out into our
          world. Read this book with pride and with pleasure!” —<b

          author of <i>Dreaming Me: Black, Baptist, and Buddhist</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Joyfully Just</i> reveals the transformative power of
          joy and its role in liberation from oppression. Combining wisdom from
          Buddhist and Black cultural traditions, Dr. Majied provides a wealth
          of accessible contemplative practices to help navigate a world full of
          suffering. By encouraging us to embrace our natural, playful curiosity
          and see the joy inherent in fighting injustice, she offers a vision of
          a world with more compassion, greater resilience, and better tools to
          face hardship and embrace our interconnectedness.” —<b

          >
          author of <i>Attuned </i>and <i>Healing Collective Trauma</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Joyfully Just</i> is a transformative exploration of
          meditation and social justice, encouraging readers to start within
          themselves to address privilege, oppression, and equity. Majied’s book
          intertwines contemplative practices and playful curiosity, guiding
          readers toward liberating self-awareness and compassionate engagement
          with the world.” —<b>Angel Acosta, EdD,</b> founder of the Acosta
          Institute<br /><br />“There is profound meaning that
          <i>Joyfully Just </i>offers in describing all the practices that allow
          ‘the joy of facing injustice’ to emerge. Dr. Majied teaches us deeply
          about possibilities of connecting personal change with the liberation
          of social transformation.” —<b>Larry Yang,</b> author of
          <i>Awakening Together</i><br /><br />“Dr. Majied’s book is a
          lighthouse that illuminates the intricacies of human suffering and the
          practices we can use to transform it. <i>Joyfully Just </i>helps us
          navigate the waves of our collective experiences, beckoning us home
          with the joy that is our true nature.” —<b>Ofosu Jones-Quartey,</b>
          meditation teacher and musician<br /><br />“Dr. Majied is someone whom
          you are fortunate to be with, whether in person or in a book. Like all
          of Dr. Majied’s work, <i>Joyfully Just </i>brings us to the deep joy
          that comes from engaging in contemplative practices that turn us
          toward inhumanity and injustice with courage, compassion, and a
          beginner’s mind.” —<b>Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu</b>, author of
          <i>From Mindfulness to Heartfulness</i><br /><br />“Kamilah Majied is
          our teacher in the Black wisdom of music, dance, and prayer that she
          relates directly to Buddhist meditation. In this revolutionary new
          book, she teaches us how to be joyful and just at the same time, and
          she shows us that this is precisely the secret of the great social
          activists, of the Black spiritual traditions, of a genuine and fierce
          historical consciousness, and of the Buddhist teachings themselves. It
          would be difficult to overestimate the importance of this message or
          the compassion with which it is performed on the page.” —<b
            >Jeffrey J. Kripal</b
          >, author of <i>How to Think Impossibly</i><br /><br />“In
          highlighting joy, Majied reminds us we can realize the power of joy’s
          energy that heals and nourishes a deep resonance of justice: a justice
          embodied in the fabric of our individual and collective lives.” —<b
