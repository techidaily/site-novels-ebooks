            >Ferdinand Foy is a mid-twenties Silicon Valley success story. Very
            successful, in fact. ‘On the fast-track to becoming a billionaire’
            kind of successful. He assumes he knows what he wants and wakes up
            each day as an in-demand CEO everyone wants a piece of: girls,
            investors, the media…</b
          >
          <p>
            While appearing on a podcast, Ferdinand is forced to ask himself the
            question: <i>Why do I want to become a billionaire?</i> After which,
            he takes a sabbatical from his successful tech company to go and
            <i>find himself</i>. His journey takes him across the USA and
            further adrift to Spain, England, Cambodia, Bali and South America.
            Along the way, he meets fellow entrepreneurs, authors, and
            investors. On Ferdinand’s return to America, he experiments with new
            ideas. From meditation to an ayahuasca retreat, he begins to build a
            new definition of what success and happiness means to him.
