          The book is about a spiritual awakening, what that means and looks
          like from the human perspective. It explores the highs, the lows, the
          commonalities, the phases and the stages and ways in which the reader
          can support themselves. It is real, raw, authentic, at times funny,
          certainly inspiring and full of hope. Ann-Marie takes the reader's
          hand and walks them step-by-step through the stages of their own
          healing journey and offers ways that can inspire them, with practical
          suggestions and practices such as prayer, meditation, self-enquiry,
          self-care, self-expression, forgiveness and inner-child healing. At
          the heart of the book is a flushing out of the reader's relationship,
          or lack of relationship, with God. Ann-Marie reveals how she went from
          a complete non-believer and came to eventually work for the big guy
          upstairs, being guided to become a multi-faith minister. She
          endeavours to de-funk the ego's construct of God and inspire the
          reader to wake up to the love, peace, guidance and joy that is waiting
          for them through their connection with the God of their own
          understanding.

        <p>
          I have a PhD in Genetics and am a former Neuro-Scientist who was
          firmly steeped in the belief that ‘when you're dead, you're DEAD'. My
          time of ‘awakening' to my Spiritual aspect arrived when I was rocked
          to my core following the death of two husbands. I wish I could have
          had a book like this with which to guide me at a time when I sure felt
          lonely! I was such a pragmatist and non-believer, I was left totally
          confused and bewildered by some of the writings I first came across in
          this field and something like Ann-Marie's book would have grabbed me,
          I know that. This book, although very sensitively written, is also
          light-hearted, fun and extremely insightful. It is written by someone
          who has definitely ‘been there, done that and got the ‘T' shirt', as
          the saying goes. I will definitely give this as a ‘gift' to anyone
          coming to me for support when beginning their Spiritual Journey, or,
          already on it and needing a gentle reminder.
