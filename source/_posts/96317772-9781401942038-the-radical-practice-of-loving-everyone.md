            >Is "loving everyone" really possible? The answer may surprise you,
            as he chronicles his journey toward enlightenment, gaining insight
            from a very unlikely source—a four-legged guru named Mollie, who
            happens to be the most lovable yet mischievous dog in the world.<br /></b
          ><br />In his attempt to understand her ability to unconditionally
          love all, Chase begins to see the world through his best friend’s
          eyes, especially during their morning walks. Mollie’s hilarious antics
          and maddening behavior ultimately lead to profound insights learned at
          the other end of the leash.<br /><br />
          Written with heart and sidesplitting humor, this one-of-a-kind true
          story of friendship and a divine albeit outrageous dog delivers on its
          promise to reveal a pathway toward enlightenment . . . and brings each
          of us one step closer to loving everyone.<br /><br />“I believe that
          animals are on the planet so that we can know love and compassion. We
          are profoundly connected to our pets more than we are usually aware
          of, and Michael J. Chase captures that love in this book. I happily
          endorse it!”— <b>Louise Hay</b>, author of the international

          It’s filled to the brim with gracious wisdom that’s woven into
          wonderful, heartfelt stories. As you read Michael Chase’s well-crafted
          words, you will find yourself laughing, nodding with pleasure, and
          even slapping your sides . . . as the gateway to ‘loving everyone’
          opens wide and deep.”<br /><b>— Denise Linn</b>, best-selling author

          >
          is exuberant, hilarious, and thought provoking. It is an observation
          of the qualities that earn dogs ‘best friend’ status and make us feel
          so good. More important, it’s a reflection on how dogs can inspire us
          to be good, or at least better, human beings than we otherwise
          might.”<br /><b>— Anita Coupe</b>, chair, board of directors of The
          Humane Society of the United States (2008–2012)<br /><br />“I was in
          tears in the Prologue and laughing out loud in Chapter One. That’s
          when I knew I was going to love this book! Indeed, Michael J. Chase
          has entertainingly captured not just the love affair we have with our
          dogs, but why we’d do well to give up self-help books and guru
          sessions in favor of studying our canines. Mollie is an utter
          de-light, as are the lessons we learn from her through Michael’s
          eyes.”<br /><b>— Jeannette Maw</b>, master certified coach and founder
          of Good Vibe Coaching<br /><br />“I am thrilled that Michael Chase has
          written another book! The purity of the message will stir your soul,
          and most important, open your heart to everyday opportunities that can
          ignite within you an unconditional love for all.”&nbsp;<br /><b
            >— Annie Burnside</b
          >, award-winning author of Soul to Soul Parenting<br /><br />“This is
          a real treat for dog lovers interested in digging deeper into how to
          live and love with a pure heart. Don’t confuse this with the other dog
          books out there, because there’s no comparison. I highly recom-mend
          it! Get a few copies to share with the rest of your pack.”<br /><b
            >— Kat Jaibur</b
          >, writer and founder of Tiny Changes<br /><br />“This book brought
          tears and laughter to my soul, and for all who read it, it will show
          the sheer pleasure of man’s best friends and the joy they bring to our
          lives.”&nbsp;<br /><b>— Vicki Monroe</b>, Spirit Messenger and author
          of <i>Understanding Spirit, Understanding Yourself</i> and
          <i>Voices From Heaven</i><br /><br />“A big thank-you to Michael and
          Mollie for letting us join them on their adventures. From around the
          neighborhood to the path of enlightenment,
          <i>The Radical Practice of Loving Everyone</i> teaches us that we only
          need a compass of love to fully enjoy the journey.”<br /><b

          will love Mollie. You will laugh at Michael and Mollie’s adventures.
          You will learn about the simplicity of life through the perspective of
          the world’s greatest teacher: man’s best friend.”<br /><b

          and life lessons from a dog? Thank you, Michael J. Chase, for being
          smart enough to learn—and kind enough to share—something so simple.
          Once again, you’ve served us with compassion and altruism. Thank you
          for writing this brilliant book.”<br /><b>— Scott Wittig</b>,

          spiritual teachers on how to transform our lives through deeper
