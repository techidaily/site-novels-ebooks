            The world-famous medium and star of Lifetime Movie Network’s #1
            rated show <i>The Haunting Of . . .</i> tells her story, shares some
            astonishing, never-before-revealed details of her celebrity
            readings, and teaches you how to harness your own energy and access
            the world beyond our own.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she was nine years old, Kim Russo discovered she had an amazing
            gift—she could communicate with the dead. Deeply skeptical, she
            denied her talent for years. But as she gradually reconciled her
            ability with her religious beliefs, Kim embraced who she is—and
            ultimately accepted her soul’s mission as a voice for the spirit
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Known as the “Happy Medium” for her authenticity, warmth, and her
            honest, positive readings, Kim has helped people from all walks of
            life to connect with those who have passed on. Now, this
            world-renowned medium demystifies the world of the dead for
            everyone. The key to understanding, she contends, is energy, which
            cannot be destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>The Happy Medium</i> interweaves experiences from Kim's life with
            some of the best, most astounding behind-the-scenes stories of her
            celebrity readings from episodes of her Lifetime show,
            <i>The Haunting Of . . .</i> . In addition, she gives you the tools
            to access the energy that is all around us, including the
            experiments and lessons she uses in many of her sold-out appearances
            and courses around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following her mantra, “Let them lead you,” Kim shows you how to let
            the world of the dead guide you to greater understanding of life’s
            biggest questions.
