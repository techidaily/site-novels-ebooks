          THE EMERGENCE OF SOUL, MEANING AND IMMORTALITY<br /><br />The grand
          religious stories that gave meaning to life and death in the past have
          crumbled under sceptical scrutiny. The dominant mainstream philosophy
          is now scientific objectivism, which describes a universe that exists
          for no reason and a life that ends in oblivion. <br /><br />Pioneering
          philosopher Tim Freke addresses the "soul crisis" in modern culture
          that has arisen from lack of meaning. He offers an intelligent
          "spiritual" perspective on life and death to help us make sense of a
          paradoxical world, which is sometimes bleak and banal, but also can be
          magical and full of significance. He presents a revolutionary paradigm
          shift in our understanding of reality that integrates the deepest
          insights of science and spirituality to create a new model of human
          identity, which makes the idea of the immortal soul intellectually
          credible. <br /><br />He explores the process of evolution, not as
          blind chance, but as the momentous story of the self-realising
          universe. The development of the material world has led to the
          emergence of "psyche" or "soul," which you are experiencing right now
          as a stream of thoughts and images that don't exist in space and
          aren't made of matter. <br /><br />We are not insignificant specks in
          a vast purposeless cosmos. We are significant participants in the
          magnificent and meaningful story of soul. The universe is coming to
          know itself through each one of us and this process doesn't end at
          death, because the evolution of soul has also been the evolution of
          immortality.
