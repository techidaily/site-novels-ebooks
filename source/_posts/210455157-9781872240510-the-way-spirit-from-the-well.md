            This book is a compilation of eight short books written between 2009
            and 2017, in the ninth and tenth decades of the author’s life. It
            contains his spiritual philosophy expressed in simple language
            accessible to all. The book tells of what the author has come to
            believe after a lifetime of seeking for the meaning of life, and how
            one should live that life at its optimum level.&nbsp; He explains
            that this cannot be proved: it is ultimately not susceptible to the
            usual scientific methods, for it lies in a different realm of
            reality which has to be experienced inwardly. However, its main
            tenets lie behind world religions and go back to mankind`s earliest
            thinkings and feelings. Believe it or not, as you will, suggests the
            author. All he can say is that it has sustained him throughout his
            life and has made that life harmonious and joyous. The teachings of
            which he speaks are often referred to as the Ancient Wisdom. He
            first came across them at the age of twenty-five when he met a man
            who was well versed in that ancient wisdom which is to be found
            woven throughout major religions, philosophies and mystical
            teachings. This man was Eugene Halliday, who, the author says, was
            said to be one of the great spirits of the modern age. The phrase he
            used to describe the ultimate result of these teachings was
            ‘Reflexive Self-Consciousness’. This, the author explains, was the
            same message taught by those of old, although expressed by his
            mentor Halliday in more modern terms. A wise but modest man, the
            author says that he is no academic or scholar or learned man —
            adding, with gentle humour, that it is written that an academic is
            an ass with a load of books on his back. He writes for the average
            person ‘in the street’ who has no time left to think on these things
            but who may like to know more. He writes for this person — for he is
            such a one himself, he says. It is this which makes his story and
            his accumulated wisdom both inspiring and accessible.
