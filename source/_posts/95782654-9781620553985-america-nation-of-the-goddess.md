          Explores how a secret cabal of influential families has shaped the
          United States according to the principles of sacred geometry and
          Goddess veneration <br />
          <br />• Exposes the esoteric influences behind the National Grange
          Order of Husbandry <br />
          <br />• Examines the sacred design and hidden purpose of the
          Washington Monument <br />
          <br />• Reveals how the three obelisks in New York City depict the
          stars of Orion’s Belt <br />
          <br />• Explains how every baseball diamond is actually a temple to
          the Goddess <br />
          <br />In <i>America: Nation of the Goddess</i>, Alan Butler and Janet
          Wolter reveal how a secret cabal of influential “Venus” families with
          a lineage tracing back to the Eleusinian Mysteries has shaped the
          history of the United States since its founding. The evidence for such
          incredible assertions comes from American institutions such as the
          National Grange Order of Husbandry and from the man-made landscape of
          the United States where massive structures and whole cities conform to
          an agenda designed to elevate the feminine within religion and
          society. <br />
          <br />The authors explain how the Venus families, working through the
          Freemasons and later the Grange, planned the American Revolution and
          the creation of the United States. It was this group who set the stage
          for the Founding Fathers to create Washington, D.C., according to the
          principles of sacred geometry, with an eye toward establishing the New
          Jerusalem. The authors explore the sacred design of the Washington
          Monument, revealing its occult purpose and connections to the heavens.
          They reveal how the obelisks in New York City depict the stars of
          Orion’s Belt just like the Giza pyramids and how the site of one of
          them, St. Paul’s Chapel, is the American counterpart to Rosslyn Chapel
          in Scotland. Exposing the strong esoteric influences behind the
          establishment of the Grange in the United States, they connect this
          apparently conservative order of farmers to the Venus families and
          trace its lineage back to the Cisterians, who were a major voice in
          the promotion of the Crusades and the establishment of the Knights
          Templar. <br />
          <br />The authors conclude with the startling revelation that nearly
          every city in America has a temple to the Goddess hidden in plain
          sight--their baseball diamonds--exposing the extent to which the Venus
          families are still at work behind the scenes.

        <p>
          “What does a Cistercian monastery have to do with Grange Halls in
          America? How did the Freemasons and the Knights Templar get involved?
          What is the Megalithic Yard and how did it affect the design of our
          nation’s capitol? Are Demeter’s Elysinian Mysteries alive and well in
          Washington, D.C.? Is there really an Egyptian Temple in New York City,
          hidden in plain sight? These are the questions that these authors
          tackle and the answers are astounding. Both of them have well-tested
          reputations in the field of historical research. They have documented
          evidence that a group of people (the Venus Families) have influenced
          the birth and development of the United States of America since its
          very beginnings. They have spent decades ferreting out the real-world
          evidence for that lineage, and now they are taking readers on a
          real-world adventure in search of esoteric mysteries. The mysteries,
          according to these authors, turn out not to be all that esoteric. The
          evidence is documented in ancient texts, in archeological sites, and
          in extant buildings right here in the USA. Even your most conservative
          customers are realizing that a powerful change is occurring in our
          world now. Many people believe that the energies of the Goddess have
          been surfacing during these recent turbulent times. That’s exactly
          what these authors believe. Dense with academic information, this
          350-page book is amazingly readable and engaging. It has something for
          everybody. You might be surprised by how many of your customers are
          interested.”
