          Thank you. I loved your book! Your ability to transcend time and shift
          seamlessly in your writing between the past, present and future is
          outstanding. My favourite quote follows:<br />“Once you see things
          differently it opens up a world of possibilities. A world of
          possibilities means you can quit the struggle, and quitting the
          struggle makes it so much easier to move forward.” This is one of many
          gems that you have provided me through your writing. I welcome sharing
          some of the new and positive experiences that I am sure will eventuate
          from your wonderful writing. (Tim Anderson)

          Tonight I sang in public in front of my work mates who I spend 2/3 of
          my life with as a FIFO!<br />My courage and self belief developed in
          myself after reading and learning to understand myself from the most
          amazing book published! Thank you Bron (Sian Tiltman)
        </p>
        <p>
          Last night I received this book, its words really powerful, could not
          put it down. Very aware that it has taken me 30+ years to learn and
          put this very book into action. Today I met another who needed to read
          what this Author had written, so passed it on. Feels good when you can
          help empower another. Thank you Bronwen Sciortino. (Kez Wickham St
          George)
        </p>
        <p>
          Bronwen Sciortino’s first book ‘Keep It Super Simple’ is as much a
          share from the soul as it is a practical guide to reconnecting to the
          real self. Her writing style enabled me to easily relate to my own
          life experiences, giving me powerful tools to help find my way ‘home’.
          I would recommend this book to any ‘recovering perfectionist’ – indeed
          I would recommend it to anyone ready to live life with ease and joy.

          I am nearly finished your book! Oh Boy, Oh Boy! What a lot of courage
          it must of taken to put your heart on your sleeve and tell it how it
          was! I’m getting a few lessons myself – because I, like you, feel that
          my body is telling me it’s time for change! (Carol Rees)
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're exhausted, stressed or tired - buy a copy of this book - it
          WILL change your life! (Joanne Casey)
