            >Poems, essays, and prompts to sing a new world into being--Queer
            &amp; BIPOC perspectives on poetry as an insurgent ritual for
            manifesting liberation and reclaiming power.</b
          ><br /><br />Written for poets, spellcasters, and social justice
          witches, <i><b>Poetry as Spellcasting</b></i> reveals the ways poetry
          and ritual can, together, move us toward justice and transformation.
          It asks:
          <i
            >If ritualized violence upholds white supremacy, what ritualized
            acts of liberation can be activated to subvert and reclaim power?</i
          ><br /><br />In essays from a diverse group of contributing poets,
          organizers, and ritual artists,
          <i><b>Poetry as Spellcasting</b></i> helps readers explore, play, and
          deepen their creativity and intuition as integral tools for self- and
          communal healing and social change. Each section opens with a poem and
          includes prompts that invite the reader to engage more deeply with:<br /><br /><b
            >Portals of Inheritance: Ancestral Teachings, Possible Futures </b
          >opens portals to messages from ancestors and for survival<b
            >Languages of Liberation, Disruption, and Magic</b
          >
          explores how poetry and spellcasting allow us to enter into and
          harness language in active, heightened ways that both reflect reality
          and manifest alternatives.<b>Invoking Radical Imagination</b> leans
          into the incantatory possibilities of poetry as prayer and poetry as
          enchantment.<b>Sacred Practices: Rituals of Repair and Revision</b>
          explores writing as ritual, ritual as practice, and practice as doing,
          drawing connections between the creative practices of poetry and
          spellwork.<b>Lighting Fires, Breaking Chains </b>focuses on the
          explicitly magical and political nature of poetry as spellcasting.<b
            >Elemental Ecologies, Spiritual Technologies </b
          >wrestles with concepts of home, colonization, and belonging<br />Both
          poetry and occult studies have been historically dominated by white,
          cishet writers; here, Poetry as Spellcasting reclaims the centrality
          of queer and BIPOC voices in poetry, magic, and liberatory spellwork.

          “Reading <i>Poetry As Spellcasting</i>, I kept lighting my altar, kept
          nourishing my body with fragrant oranges as I dreamt, wandered, and
          envisioned. This is a book for us, for opening up the creative portals
          toward liberation, one tender prompt at a time. I felt held by these
          rituals and poems, felt myself move deeply into spaces of collective
          care. Alongside contributions from luminaries such as Alexis Pauline
          Gumbs, Joan Naviyuk Kane, and Ching-In Chen, the editors invoke magic
          through heart-igniting reflections and vibrational prompts,
          beautifully reminding us of our woven power: ‘In this new mythology,
          you are always whole.’”<br />—Jane Wong, author of
          <i>How to Not Be Afraid of Everything</i><br /><br />“Spellbinding,
          nourishing, and needed! <i>Poetry as Spellcasting</i> is unbounding
          and delivers a world of magic, incantations, and poetry for your
          spirit, skins, and memories to taste, discover, unfold, shed, and tend
          to the alchemy of our lives. Like rock candy or bubbles to the tongue,
          swallow and repeat to feel all your senses come alive, initiating a
          psychic surrender, embodiment, and deepening of why and how poets of
          color are casting spells for radically transformative, imaginative
          healing for our prayerful liberatory futures. Listen.”<br />—Cara
          Page, cofounder of Kindred Southern Healing Justice Collective,
          founder of Changing Frequencies, and coauthor of
          <i>Healing Justice Lineages</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Poetry as Spellcasting</i
          >
          is both alluring and substantive, gentle yet revolutionary. A
          provoking collection of poems and essays, this powerful book is sure
          to evoke inspiration, action, and reflection for readers.”<br />—Maria
          Minnis, author of <i>Anti-Racism with the Tarot</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Poetry As Spellcasting</i
          >
          is an anthology I have been looking for all my writing life. Have you
          ever felt something so far from the ‘norm’ you just kept it to
          yourself? You talk to people with ancient names in a little place
          behind the eye(s), and you were once sure if anyone ever found out
          about this place, they would come and take you away, and you’ll never
          see your mama again. Poetry As Spellcasting lets me know I am not
          alone in these southern Black ways of being. I keep thinking, what if
          my mama had this book when she was in high school? What kind of portal
          could it have been? <i>Poetry As Spellcasting</i> has set a new stage
          for what an anthology can be and how much it can do.”<br />—Tyree
          Daye, author of <i>Cardinal</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Poetry as Spellcasting</i
          >
          gathers insightful and courageous provocations to affirm and amplify
          the world-shaping magics in our language. By our, I mean those of us
          laboring at the sites where devastation and (re)generation meet. By
          magics, I mean our capacities for care, transformation, and
          continuance. I received the spells in this book as gifts of renewal,
          as a summoning of the elements that activate our intentional presence,
          here and there, now and ever, among the countless trajectories of a
          hurting and beloved home-as-it-is-yet-to-be. The voices in this circle
          call me to pay closer attention, to commit to the discipline of
          repair, to begin again with grace.”<br />—Cynthia Dewi Oka, author of
          <i>Fire Is Not a Country</i><br /><br />“Alive, potent, and opening
          roads for and by multiple voices and beings,
          <i>Poetry as Spellcasting</i> is as much a work of art as a Spirit
          guidebook to our collective future. These are processes that embolden
          our purposes as healers and writers. The quiet space before anything
          is written lives here, echoes across time calling forth ways in the
          direction of our necessary un-doing for tomorrow. Grandmas, ritual
          sites, and plant medicine—all in poetry.
          <i>Poetry as Spellcasting</i> holds possibilities needed for our
          future, ways of writing that are not trapped, that go beyond the world
          as we have known it. Power is encapsulated in its most genuine and raw
          form. Power towards liberation for all beings. A holy, magical,
          unknowing that releases us into transcendence. These poem-makers
          invite all beings to stay, to imagine, to transcend, to transgress, to
          magic, and to make possible.”<br />—Marlanda Dekine, author of
          <i>Thresh &amp; Hold</i>
