              >“On its surface, this is a book about tarot, but at its core,
              it's offering a radical and revolutionary path to true healing."
              —Liz Moody, host of <i>The Liz Moody Podcast</i> and author of
              <i>100 Ways to Change Your Life</i></b
            ><br /><br />Are you longing to rewrite your personal narrative,
            connect to your purpose, and pursue it with confidence? Do you seek
            a grounded approach to connecting to your intuition, being seen,
            heard, and heart-led? "Anyone interested in falling in love with
            their mind, body, and spirit should look to the tarot," says
            intuitive healer and tarot reader Kate Van Horn. "Tarot has an
            uncanny knack for illuminating what already exists in our energies,
            bodies, and intuitions. When harnessed, it can serve as a helpful
            tool for profound self-acceptance and healing."<br /><br /><i
              >The Inner Tarot </i
            >isn't just a book about how to read the cards. It's a guidebook for
            those ready to embark on a healing journey equipped with tools to
            help you foster your intuition, own your story, and harness your
            soul's purpose.<br /><br />Just like a deck of tarot cards, the book
            is divided into two parts:<br /><br />• In Part I, you’ll learn to
            explore the nuances of pulling cards to ground you in the practice
            and discover the tools to become a confident reader. Consider it a
            crash course in card reading. Kate will also share tips for creating
            rituals around your deck, understanding numerology, reading
            reversals, crafting tarot spreads, and more.<br /><br />• In Part
            II, Kate guides you through individual card interpretations as well
            as thought-provoking, heart-opening exercises intended to facilitate
            healing and honor your resilience and personal story. You’ll refer
            to this again and again as you create your tarot practice and make
            deeper connections with each archetype.<br /><br />Discover a deeper
            approach to self-inquiry, a new depth in your experience, pride in
            your personal story, and an empowered approach to their
            communication.
