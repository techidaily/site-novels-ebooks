            A Brave, True Story is a heartfelt and inspiring memoir that reveals
            how it is possible to heal from a painful past and live with
            passion, purpose and fulfillment. It provides an insightful
            exploration into the world of relationships, emotions and recovering
            from dark experiences of the past. Natalie Jovanic is a successful
            relationship coach and trainer, but her past hasn't always been so
            rosy. As a young child, she was not supported or protected and as a
            result, grew into a woman who, in her own words, 'had abandoned
            herself'. She entered into unhealthy relationships that she
            considered to be normal and didn't expect anything better. Then, a
            trip to Thailand opened her eyes about the negativity of her
            relationships and she began to follow her inner voice. By
            recognizing the destructive patterns, Natalie cleared them out
            through different healing methods and replaced them with healthy
            ones. This empowers her to say "no" to unhealthy relationships and
            changed the course of her life into fulfillment. She recovered her
            deep love for herself and was finally able to put painful emotions
            from the past to rest, for good. The memoir is delicately built
            around reconstructed dialogue and incidents. Natalie successfully
            recreates her inner monologues and gives clear images about her
            inner process. 'A Brave True Story' is Natalie's deeply personal
            account of her journey from the darkness of her past to her current
            life, which is full of happiness, hope and possibilities. It is the
            story of a woman who dreamed of being healed and whole - and she
            triumphed. Reviews: "This true and inspiring story of sadness and
            joy, disappointment and happiness, will touch your heart and help
            you to release your full potential for living." Brain Tracy, Author
            of 'No Excuses' "[A] delicate memoir about a woman's path to healing
            the darkness of violence and suffering....[The author's] utter
            simplicity and directness-her impeccable inner child's innocence-win
            our trust...as she shines her gentle steady light through the scary
            woods to open roads and unexpected opportunity." R. S. Evans, human
            ecologist, author of RICE (2014) "If you loved Angela's Ashes,
            you'll love - and be incredibly moved by - A Brave, True Story."
