            >From integral philosopher Ken Wilber, a practical guide to finding
            a radical and complete Wholeness through a path that blends integral
            theory, psychology, spiritual practice, and shadow work.</b
          ><br /><br />According to Ken Wilber, the perpetual human&nbsp;search
          for growth and fulfillment is often incomplete. In this book, Wilber
          integrates the wisdom of spirituality, psychology, shadow work,
          science, and integral theory to offer us a path to a radical and
          complete Wholeness of Waking Up, Growing Up, Opening Up, Cleaning Up,
          and Showing Up. Wilber shows readers how to apply integral theory to
          their everyday lives for transformation. For example, he shows how the
          theory of the Four Quadrants—the four perspectives through which we
          view the world—relates to our lives and allows us to show up and be
          more present. He also discusses how to evolve our multiple
          intelligences, how to increase our spiritual awareness, how to process
          what’s hidden in the depths of our consciousness, and how to enhance,
          deepen, and widen the feelings of bliss and love through the practice
          of integral tantric sex. Wilber introduces several practices—on topics
          such as the Witness, One Taste, and shadow work—to lead us to direct
          experiences that we can integrate into our lives. In this way, we
          truly understand Wholeness and can make room for everything life
          brings our way.<br /><br />No other path of growth includes these five
          categories—each of which is a unique path to wholeness. By combining
          them and integrating them, one comes to a realization of what Wilber
          calls Big Wholeness—a completeness in which everything in our
          experience comes together to pull us into this deep meaning, where we
          feel in touch not only with all of the important aspects of ourselves
          but also with everything in our world.

          “A true visionary, Ken Wilber offers a perspective-changing approach
          to stepping into the fullness of your life!”<br />—<b>Tony Robbins</b
          >, <i>New York Times</i> #1 best-selling author<br /><br />“With this
          exploration of the structures of Growing Up and states of Waking Up,
          Wilber’s wisdom does it again. If, like myself, you are struggling
          with the disturbing rise in global conflict, frustrated fighting to
          end a seemingly relentless social problem, or wrestling with deep
          personal challenges, take a breather to take this in. In a time of
          brutal division, Wilber’s authority as philosopher helps me navigate
          moments when I painfully disagree with what is said, and gives me an
          uncompromising reminder to rethink my perspectives with an open head
          and heart toward myself and others, to quiet my monkey mind, to
          appreciate all our potential, and ready myself to recommit to a life
          in the now.”<br />—<b>Julia Ormond</b>, Actor/Activist<br /><br />“<i
            >Finding Radical Wholeness</i
          >
          is a guide for all people who seek to integrate wholeness into every
          aspect of their lives. It is an extraordinary self-help book. It
          seamlessly integrates ancient and current Eastern spiritual knowledge
          and contemporary Western psychology about human flourishing. It shows
          the reader a many-faceted path toward personal growth and awakening
          without relinquishing the jewels of thousands of years of human
          striving for wholeness. This book champions a compelling and
          liberating view of humanity.”<br />—<b>Dr. Susanne R. Cook-Greuter</b
          >, independent scholar of developmental psychology and author<br /><br />“‘Wholeness’
          is an ideal sought by many people and many movements, but in
          <i>Finding Radical Wholeness</i>, Ken Wilber unlocks the concept to
          reveal further dimensions and possibilities, and thereby gives us a
          richer, fuller, and more compelling vision of what wholeness is and
          what we can be.”<br />—<b>Roger Walsh</b>, MD, PhD, Professor of
          Psychiatry, Philosophy, and Anthropology, University of California<br /><br />“Ken
          Wilber has written an exceptional guide for the
          spiritual-but-not-religious reader. Drawing from a lifetime of
          contemplation, Wilber presents an intriguing and compelling vision of
          Wholeness, seamlessly integrating traditional wisdom, modern-day
          insights, and practical transformative techniques. Like all of his
          work, this book provides us with a roadmap for genuine spiritual
          engagement and a compass pointing the way toward our spiritual
          evolution.”<br />—<b>Diane Musho Hamilton</b>, professional mediator
          and author of <i>The Zen of You and Me</i>
