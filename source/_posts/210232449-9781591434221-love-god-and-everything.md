          • Explores how to consciously evolve, heal our generational trauma,
          and awaken to the amazing potential we each hold for transformation
          <br /><br />• Shares unique maps and models for psychospiritual
          integration, spiritual awakening, and evolving consciousness
          <br /><br />• Examines the evolutionary continuum of the soul and
          catalytic astrological events that will influence humanity in the
          years and decades ahead <br /><br />Humanity is undergoing a planetary
          wake-up call: in order to survive the global spiritual, ecological,
          and cultural crises we now face, the long, dark night of the
          collective soul,we need to consciously evolve, heal our generational
          trauma, and awaken to the amazing potential we each hold for profound
          transformation. <br /><br />In this sweeping exploration of love,
          consciousness, and awakening, Nicolya Christi offers a deep
          investigation of the Great Shift of Ages that is now occurring. She
          shares detailed personal accounts of the extraordinary metaphysical,
          psychic, and out-of-body experiences she has had throughout her life
          along with the direct spiritual insights she gained as a result. She
          explores what consciousness is and examines the evolutionary continuum
          of the soul--including the voyage of the incarnate soul, the
          metaphysical-spiritual reality of the excarnate soul, and the
          beyond-soul reality. She also shares maps and models for
          psychospiritual integration, awakening, and evolving consciousness
          that she has pioneered. <br /><br />Examining the personal and
          collective human shadow, the author looks at the central role
          epigenetics play in our current fear-based reality and explores the
          impact of stories of wounding from a personal, ancestral, and karmic
          perspective. Focusing on healing generational and collective trauma,
          she shows how by changing our “story,” we can change the world and
          transcend the shadow of human experience. She explores spiritual
          wisdom from ancient cultures spanning millennia, especially the
          Classic Maya, and highlights evolutionary astrological events that
          will influence humanity in the years and decades ahead as we more
          fully awaken. <br /><br />Sharing her vision for the New Earth,
          Nicolya reveals how deeply feeling and envisioning our
          post-transformation future as if it has already happened will help
          bring it into being. She also shares a look into the new epoch of
          wellness, regeneration, psychology, biology, and technology that will
          unfold as humanity transitions from the dysfunctional old paradigm
          into a conscious and awakened new world.

          “Nicolya Christi has reached a level of spiritual development that is
          nearly unmatched in the contemporary world. To read what she has
          written is to catch a glimpse of the reality that lies below the
          surface and makes us who we are: beings that come from love, are love,
          and to love will return. To fail to benefit from and to live Nicolya’s
          message is a crime against humanity--and against us, as intelligent
          and responsible members of humanity.”
