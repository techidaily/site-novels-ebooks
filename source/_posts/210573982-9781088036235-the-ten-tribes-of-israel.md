            Many years ago, the attention of the compiler of the following pages
            was first called to the subject by hearing a lecture delivered by a
            highly educated Cherokee Indian, on the manners and customs of the
            various Indian tribes of North America. During the course of his
            remarks, he stated that when he came to study the Hebrew language,
            he was astonished to find so much of his own language that was pure
            Hebrew. And after enumerating the various words of his own language
            that were Hebrew, he found them to exceed fifty. "And," said he, "we
            were taught this by our ancestors, and they received it from their
            Hebrew ancestors, the Ten Tribes."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And furthermore, he stated that he was as firmly convinced that the
            Indian tribes of North America were descendants of the Ten Tribes of
            Israel, as he was of any other fact. This statement induced us to
            examine history on this question, and we have found many facts
            corroborating the testimony of the Red Man of the forest. Though
            differing from some other writers on this subject, we have the
            testimony of a number of the most eminent men of America to sustain
            our position.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The compiler Timothy Jenkins (1821-1883) in his 1883 book "The Ten
            Tribes of Israel" gathers together a vast array of different facts,
            stories, legends, anecdotes, archaeological discoveries, language
            comparisons, etc., from a vast array of different sources to support
            the claim first propounded by the educated Cherokee that the
            American Indians are descendants of the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The ten lost tribes were the ten of the twelve tribes of ancient
            Israel that were said to have been deported from the Kingdom of
            Israel after its conquest by the Neo-Assyrian Empire circa 722 BCE.
            These are the tribes of Reuben, Simeon, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, Asher,
            Issachar, Zebulun, Manasseh and Ephraim. Claims of descent from the
            "lost" tribes have been proposed in relation to many groups, and
            some religions espouse a messianic view that the tribes will return.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The Jewish historian Josephus (37-100 CE) wrote that "the ten tribes
            are beyond the Euphrates till now, and are an immense multitude and
            not to be estimated in numbers."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            An example of the various discoveries in America evidencing
            Israelite presence includes an 1853 discovery of "a silver coin
            found last summer in Michigan, about twenty miles from Detroit, two
            feet under the surface of the earth. The coin is about the size of
            an American half dollar, not so great in circumference but thicker.
            On one side is represented a censer with smoking incense, with a
            Hebrew inscription, 'Jewish Shekel:" on the other, also, is a Hebrew
            inscription, "The Holy Jerusalem," with a representation of an olive
            tree, or, perhaps, palm tree."
          </p>

          <p>About the author:&nbsp;</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            An Ohioan born in 1821, Timothy R. Jenkins was the prolific author
            of mostly biblical interpretations of history, one of which resulted
            in his arrest on charges of "blasphemy." He died in his 63rd year
            while traveling to Cleveland for the publication of what would prove
            to be his last book, The Ten Tribes of Israel.
