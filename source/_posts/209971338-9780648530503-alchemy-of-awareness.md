          <p><strong>From the Author...</strong></p>
          <p>
            After decades of remembering, learning and experiencing, the one
            thing I offer as a way forward is an ancient teaching that is more
            relevant today than ever before,
          </p>
          <p>“Everything you need to know you already have within”</p>
          <p>
            I offer the words in each chapter of this book as a journey of hope,
            wisdom, new beginnings, expanded thoughts, and a return to the
            potential you are, as a unique, &nbsp;evolving soul gifting your
            imprint, energy and vibration in this world of change.
          </p>
          <p>We are remembering,</p>
          <p>We matter</p>
          <p>We are enough</p>
          <p>We are unique</p>
          <p>We are brilliant lights</p>
          <p>We are potential</p>
          <p>Namaste'</p>

          "Alchemy of Awareness’ has been our best selling book in 2019 even
          though it has only been in our shop for a few months. Well done
          Raelene, it has been amazing to watch ‘Alchemy’s’ attractability and
          positive flow!"&nbsp;Natural Forces Bookshop, Elwod VIC

          "Pick up Alchemy Of Awareness and begin anywhere and you will feel
          gently moved down a path of awakening, awakening of your great self:
          AWARENESS. The title is spot on. If I start a book and after a
          paragraph or two feel that I want to keep going because I am curious
          where this will take me, I consider that I great sign. Each chapter
          heading is a keyword that can guide you to just what you need: TRUST,
          TRIGGERS, TRANSITIONING. In the end, each takes you through a brief
          exploration of a place we find our selves in the journey of life;
          Stuck or in the middle of a great transition, lost, sick or
          overwhelmed with loss. But we have not left these places with just
          concepts. Raelene brings us back at the End of each section with a
          simple but powerful declaration to help us take a new stand in life
          and then we are given actions to help establish that new stance.
        </p>
        <p>How to love yourself no matter what is happening in your life.</p>
        <p>
          Even though Raelene with clear intention meant this book to be for
          everyone and not just for the seasoned seeker , there is still much in
          her book for all of us no matter how seasoned we think we are. None of
          us are too far along not to need a nudge to a new way of seeing
          something or a wonderfully simple tool of helping ourselves. Raelene
          has succeeded in speaking of what on the surface is a simple concept,
          “awareness” but one which is as difficult to live continuously in.
          Just as the idea of “be quiet’ is simple but no so very easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has made it accessible to all and given us easy steps forward into
          a life that has our spirituality integrated into it. Easy as declaring
          to the vast army that serves your life with great conviction “ This is
          the truth of today”. Speak it and it shall be. This army within will
          follow you just follow the gentle easy and clear guidance Raelene
          presents to you. A simple book on a vastly ancient and profound
          subject such as the Alchemy Of Awareness is no small accomplishment.
          And in these times the simpler the better in order to reach the most
          people in all walks of life. In the end, it’s a powerful workbook on
          the many ways we can love ourselves every day no matter what life
          brings to our plate."Clay Lomakayu&nbsp;Actor, Author,
          Shaman,&nbsp;Medicine of One
