          <p>
            You are a busy woman. Are you juggling many demands on your time?
            Are you feeling tired or overwhelmed by the mental load? Are you
            yearning for more meaning and connection? Or, are you thriving, but
            would love even more energy?
          </p>
          <p>
            We have grown up to believe we can have it all. Yet in this modern
            world, women are burning out and often overriding the messages from
            their bodies and souls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our energy is our most valuable commodity, but few people understand
            how to boost, nourish, clear and protect their energy. This book
            provides the answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through a compelling mixture of storytelling, inspiration and
            practical advice, this book provides insights into the
            body-mind-soul connection, an explanation of the laws of energy, and
            simple, quick daily energy habits to help you:
          </p>
          find your soul amongst the busyness of modern life;access your inner
          power, inner calm and infinite energy;reduce stress and worry; andlive
          an inspired and thriving life.
          <p>
            "Alicia overflows with pure love. Her teachings lead us toward
            finding our life purpose as she offers a gentle and graceful way
            toward discovering our inner oasis. She shows us how to cultivate
            this garden of energy within, so we can flow with life’s unwanted,
            but necessary, difficulties. When you recognise the magnificence of
            the energy flowing through you, you realise that it’s flowing
            through others too."

          “I wanted to say thank you Alicia. I am so appreciative that you have
          opened up this world to me and so many others. I enjoy your messages
          and they help me when I feel a little lost.&nbsp; I feel very blessed
          that through you I have found a lot of peace, less fear and more love.
          Thank you. I am learning and growing and feel very blessed.”
          <strong>~Kim</strong>

          “Thank you Alicia. You have helped me immensely with the state of
          anxiety that I was having regarding my daughter’s illness. I have been
          doing your exercises and taken on your advice to connect with source
          energy and just transmit that energy through to my daughter. I can
          gladly report that we found out that she is back to normal. I can’t
          tell you the amount of gratitude I have for you and the work you are
          doing.” <strong>~Rose</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “When I first heard and saw you, I was immediately taken in by your
          natural, calm, and genuine presence. I have now listened to many of
          your powerful exercises and channelled messages. I love that they are
          quick and easy to follow and work a treat. The clearing exercise works
          immediately for me as it lifts and lightens my energy and mood every
          time, and it immediately fixed a very sore throat that I had had for
          days. Thank you, Alicia.” <strong>~Brit</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “After&nbsp;doing the exercises consistently each day for a couple of
          months, I realised that I was feeling more grounded and was feeling
          more present and able to manage the daily stressors of life
          ...&nbsp;the cumulative affect has been so beneficial to my sense of
          wellbeing and is helping me to be a calmer and more present wife, mum
          and business owner and I am kinder to myself. Thank you Alicia.”
          <strong>~Tyla</strong>

          “I wanted to thank you for the breathing exercises. I have been
          struggling with a lack of energy in the morning and I have been so
          much better since starting to do your ‘Start the Day’ breathing.”
          <strong>~Tahlia</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          “I just&nbsp; wanted to reach out and say&nbsp; thank&nbsp; you.
          For&nbsp; shining&nbsp; your&nbsp; light. I am loving&nbsp;
          watching&nbsp; you shine&nbsp; your&nbsp; beautiful&nbsp; light and
          fulfil&nbsp; your important earthy&nbsp; mission.&nbsp; You are making
          such a positive impact and difference.&nbsp; You&nbsp; inspire&nbsp;
          me&nbsp; to&nbsp; step&nbsp; into&nbsp; my&nbsp; soul’s&nbsp;
          mission&nbsp; and&nbsp; do&nbsp; the same.&nbsp; You have also&nbsp;
          changed&nbsp; my&nbsp; sister’s&nbsp; life. It is&nbsp; so magnificent
          and you are changing&nbsp; lives, in&nbsp; particular&nbsp; my&nbsp;
          sister’s.&nbsp; Since&nbsp; she has been following&nbsp; your&nbsp;
          energetic posts she has changed.”&nbsp; <strong>~Shay</strong>
