            >A vision to address our environment, economy, politics, culture,
            and to catalyze the radical whole-system change we need now</b
          ><br /><br />Recasting current problems as emergent opportunities,
          Terry Patten offers creative responses, practices, and conscious
          conversations for tackling the profound inner and outer work we must
          do to build an integral future. In practical and personal terms, he
          discusses how we can all become active agents of a transformation of
          human civilization and why that is necessary to our continued
          survival. Patten's narrative focuses on two aspects of existence--our
          dynamic but fractured and threatened world, and our underlying
          wholeness and unity. Only by honoring both of these realities
          simultaneously can we make sustainable changes in ourselves, our
          communities, our body politic, and our planetary life-support system.
          <i>A New Republic of the Heart</i> provides a comprehensive
          understanding and inspiring vision for "being the change" in a way
          that can address the most intractable problems of our time. Patten
          shows how we can come together in our communities for conversations
          that matter and describes new communities, enterprises, and forms of
          dialogue that integrate both inner personal growth work with outer
          awareness, activism, and service.

          “A New Republic of the Heart should be required reading for all humans
          over the age of sixteen.” <br />—Stanley Krippner, PhD, coauthor of
          <i>Personal Mythology</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “What we have here is possibly the finest example of the making of the
          possible human, and with this, the development of a possible
          world.”<br />
          —Jean Houston, PhD, author of <i>A Passion for the Possible</i><br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          “Terry Patten has woven together strands from evolutionary
          neuroscience, deep ecology, integral theory, and spiritual wisdom to
          offer a practical path forward out of humanity’s current morass.
          Fascinating, fast-moving, and heartfelt, this book is a gem.”<br />
          —Rick Hanson, PhD, author of<i> Buddha's Brain</i> and
          <i>Hardwiring Happiness</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Patten clarifies how our wicked problems require us to grow beyond
          debate, one-upmanship, and other non-communication, to talk and listen
          in new ways. He’s right on the mark—we must reknit our social
          fabric—our collective future requires it.” <br />
          —Joan Blades, cofounder of MoveOn.org and Living Room Conversations<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Superb, exciting, sane, and enlightening—a social activism that is
          also personal, emotional, spiritual, ecological, relational, and that
          points toward the very leading edge of evolution itself.”<br />
          —Ken Wilber, author of <i>The Integral Vision </i>and<i>
            Grace and Grit
