          In this early record of his talks and conversations with seekers, Osho
          shares the foundational underpinnings of his work in a systematic,
          straightforward, and accessible way. What does he mean when he talks
          about "consciousness?" And how does this consciousness differ from the
          bundle of anxieties, rationalizations, plans, and remembrances that
          fill most of our everyday thoughts? Does consciousness evolve and grow
          as we mature, or is it somehow timeless and eternal, merely waiting to
          be discovered? Or is it maybe both? If free will and awareness of
          death are what sets us apart as human beings from the animals, what
          are our responsibilities in deciding what choices to make, both
          individually and in relation to the world in which we live? As Osho
          puts it, "To be or not to be? To do or not to do? To do this or to do
          that? 'No choice' is not possible. If we do not choose, then we are
          choosing not to choose; it is a choice. So we are forced to choose; we
          are not free not to choose. The dignity, the beauty and the glory of
          humans is this consciousness. But it is a burden also. The glory and
          the burden come simultaneously the minute you become conscious. Every
          step is a movement between the two. With man, choice and conscious
          individuality come into existence. You can evolve, but your evolution
          will be an individual endeavor. You may evolve to become a buddha or
          you may not. The choice is yours." The intellectual rigor and
          precision of these talks are reminiscent of Osho's days as renowned
          debater and university professor. And at the same time, as always in
          his work, the mysterious, the unknowable, that which cannot be put
          into words, is honored on every page. Readers who are new to Osho's
          work will discover the science behind his revolutionary active
          meditations, and why he feels they are urgently needed for
          21st-century human beings. Those who have wondered what all the "sex
          guru" hype is about will learn how he views sex energy as an essential
          seed that, rightly nourished, will flower into meditation. Readers
          drawn to the book by the "esoteric" aspect of its title will benefit
          from his explorations of astral bodies, kundalini, and the
          significance of dreams - although some might find a few favorite
          fairytales and sacred cows challenged along the way. And, last but not
          least, longtime readers of Osho may find, in this precise and succinct
          yet comprehensive presentation of his work, the "click" that brings
          new insight and depth to familiar, much-loved texts.
