              >‘This book will teach you that healing by thought alone is not
              only possible, but it is a reality.’ - Dr Joe Dispenza,
              <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
              <i>Becoming Supernatural</i><br /></b
            ><br />There is no longer any doubt that the way we think affects
            our bodies: countless scientific studies have shown this to be true.
            <br /><br />For former pharmaceutical scientist Dr David Hamilton,
            the testing of new drugs highlighted how profoundly the mind and
            body are connected. Time and time again, the control group of
            patients in drug trials improved at similar rates to those who
            actually received the medicines. Astounded, Dr Hamilton decided to
            change the direction of his work to explore the relationship between
            the mind and the body.
          </p>
          <p>
            This bestselling acclaimed book was first published 10 years ago. In
            it, Dr Hamilton explores the effect of visualization, belief and
            positive thinking on the body, and shows how using our imagination
            and mental processes can stimulate our own defences and healing
            systems to combat disease, pain and illness.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this new edition, Dr Hamilton has added four new chapters to
            discuss the latest cutting-edge information and extraordinary new
            techniques. These include using imagery to stimulate the immune
            system - a method that can benefit cancer patients undergoing
            conventional treatment - effectively using the mind to speed up
            rehabilitation from stroke, and powerful visualization strategies to
            help facilitate recovery from injury and illness.

          “As a scientist who has embraced new consciousness, David has made a
          bridge that will be helpful to many people who are seeking to
          understand the connection between our body, our mind and our spiritual
          self.” – Louise Hay<br /><br />
          “David Hamilton has the unique gift of combining the mind-body
          connection and science in a simple but powerful way. Everyone must
          read his work!” – Suzy Walker, <i>Psychologies</i><br /><br />
          “The ease at which Dr David Hamilton is able to explain how
          visualizations and the power of the mind can be harnessed to assist
          the body to heal is extraordinary. It is truly a gift, and this
          updated version of&nbsp;<i>How Your Mind Can Heal Your Body</i
          >&nbsp;is an absolute must-read for everyone's bookshelves. As a
          university lecturer and clinical psychologist, I am constantly
          reminded of the relationship between mind and body and David's
          research and evidence provided in this book hits the scientific mark!”
