          <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Few realize that even at the present stage of civilization in this
            world, there are souls who, like the priests of the ancient temples,
            walk the earth and watch and guard the sacred fires that burn upon
            the altar of humanity. Purified ones they are, who have renounced
            the life of this sphere in order to guard and protect the Flame,
            that spiritual principle in man, now hidden beneath the ruins of his
            fallen temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we think of the nations that are past, of Greece and Rome and the
            grandeur that was Egypt's, we sigh as we recall the story of their
            fall; and we watch the nations of today, not knowing which will be
            the next to draw its shroud around itself and join that great
            ghostly file of peoples that are dead.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            But everywhere, even in the rise and fall of nations, we see through
            the haze of materiality, justice; everywhere we see reward, not of
            man but of the invincible One, the eternal Flame.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            A great hand reaches out from the unseen and regulates the affairs
            of man. It reaches out from that great spiritual Flame which
            nourishes all created things, the never dying fire that burns on the
            sacred altar of Cosmos-that great fire which is the spirit of God.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we turn again to the races now dead, we shall, if we look, find
            the cause of their destruction. The light had gone out. When the
            flame within the body is withdrawn, the body is dead. When the light
            was taken from the altar, the temple was no longer the dwelling
            place of a living God.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Degeneracy, lust, and passion, hates and fears, crept into the souls
            of Greece and Rome, and Black Magic overshadowed Egypt; the light
            upon the altar grew weaker and weaker. The priests lost the Word,
            the name of the Flame. Little by little the Flame flickered out, and
            as the last spark grew cold, a mighty nation died, buried beneath
            the dead ashes of its own spiritual fire.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            But the Flame did not die. Like spirit of which it is the essence,
            it cannot die, because it is life, and life cannot cease to be. In
            some wilderness of land or sea it rested once again, and there rose
            a mighty nation around that flame. So history goes on through the
            ages. As long as a people are true to the Flame, it remains, but
            when they cease to nourish it with their lives, it goes on to other
            lands and other worlds.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Those who worship this Flame are now called heathens. Little do we
            realize that we are heathen ourselves until we are baptised of the
            Holy Spirit, which is Fire, for fire is Light, and the children of
            the Flame are the Sons of Light, even as God is Light.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            There are those who have for ages labored with man to help him to
            kindle within himself this spark, which is his divine birthright. It
            is these who by their lives of self-sacrifice and service have
            awakened and tended this fire, and who through ages of study have
            learned the mystery it contained, that we now call the "Initiates of
            the Flame."
          </p>
          <p>
            For ages they have labored with mankind to help him to uncover the
            light within himself, and on the pages of history they have left
            their seal, the seal of Fire.
