          <p>
            The quotes in this book are the harvest of more than half a century
            spent studying and working at the boundary of spirituality and
            psychotherapy.
          </p>
          <p>
            We cannot heal deeply unless we find some spiritual basis for our
            lives. These quotes have helped me form the bridge between trauma
            and psychotherapy on one side and spiritual healing and a sense of
            meaning on the other.
          </p>
          <p>Â­</p>
          <p>
            I think poetry, novels, and quotations are a much more effective
            language for communicating about spiritual depth, healing, the
            connection between trauma and spirituality, &amp; what it means to
            be human. These styles are so much more evocative and
            thought-provoking than the rational, linear type of academic
            language that's been used for so long to talk about these subjects.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The quotes and stories in this book have each been, at one time or
            another, deeply meaningful to me, provided comfort, and supported my
            healing from deep trauma.&nbsp; Often I've kept one of these stories
            or quotes in my mind for a week or more, and sometimes even months,
            or years. Over time they become a small nucleus around which a whole
            set of ideas and concepts can form. They provide a symbolic way for
            me to think of, and to recall whole complexes of thoughts.&nbsp;

          "Have you ever wished that someone would curate a book of profound,
          witty, astute, arresting quotes that you can peruse at breakfast, peek
          at on your way to a nap, forage for a presentation, or memorize before
          taking a walk on the beach? Well, here it is-a book that abounds with
          the bright lights of the attuned mind. Thank you, Bob!"

          "Bob Falconer has indeed gone through hell and kept going. Along that
          50-year journey, he collected the pithy and wise quotes in this book.
          If you take them a few at a time and reflect on their meaning in your
          life, they can help you find the parts you need to heal, and connect
          more to Self, thereby enriching your journey."

          "A treasure chest of quotes, aphorisms, and anecdotes that will
          inspire, awaken, and make you think. Falconer has a touch for finding
          those jewels that both amuse and move. Either way, these nuggets open
          our hearts and stir our deepest self."
