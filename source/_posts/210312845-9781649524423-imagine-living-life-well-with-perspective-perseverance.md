            Book One includes Volume I and II. It opens with a crime at a
            Medieval Society event with the two main characters. Anna and Liam
            are dealing with injuries and an attempt on Liam's life. The
            fighters of said event do not use â€˜live steel.' Anna finds her
            husband and discovers he is injured. He is taken to a hospital
            emergency room for treatment. They talk with the Police. Many events
            come up once they return home and have to deal with different
            aspects of Law Enforcement. While in the hospital, Anna and Liam's
            friends create a special path in their backyard. They are able to
            use it to regain wellness. They find what works and follow many
            intuitive trails to become well again. They persevere with their
            situation having many discussions.&nbsp; The emergency room doctor
            is curious about their spiritual advents and an unusual injury to
            Anna. The doctor invites them to visit. They ask many questions,
            including a design of bracelets they are wearing which is a huge
            mystery and eventually more is known on it. Liam sets goals and
            begins to do much better. Not knowing if they will have to change
            their identity, they work on designs which may work for their
            Medieval Society. They work with a number of Law Enforcement agents.
            The have a potluck with their Medieval Society household and the
            reality of Liam's condition is seen. Anna and Liam's love for each
            other sustains them. This book leads the way to Book Two: Volumes
            III and IV and to Book Three: Volumes V and VI.
