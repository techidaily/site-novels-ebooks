            We live in a fast-paced, busy world, and many of us are stressed out
            and anxious as a result. If you suffer from anxiety but have found
            little relief from modern western treatments, or if you are looking
            for complimentary treatment, the ancient practice of qigong—which
            can be understood as the cultivation of internal energy—may offer
            you relief.
          </p>
          Qigong is rooted in Chinese philosophy and medicine, and it utilizes
          breathing, movement, and awareness exercises to promote healing and
          aid in meditation. In The Qigong Workbook for Anxiety, world-renowned
          and respected qigong master Kam Chuen Lam presents the first workbook
          for overcoming anxiety problems utilizing traditional Chinese
          energy-focusing exercises. By following these simple and accessible
          step-by-step exercises, readers will learn to transform feelings of
          anxiety into resilience and inner strength. The workbook also contains
          helpful illustrations to help you carry out these exercises.<br />
          <p>
            In the book, Lam will help you think about anxiety, and yourself, in
            a different way—as a whole. You’ll also learn to stop resisting
            moments of anxiety and other strong emotions, but rather to embrace
            them within the larger flow of your body’s energy field. By doing
            this, you will ultimately strengthen and cultivate the natural
            energy you possess.
          </p>
          Author Kam Chuen Lam has been a traditional Chinese healer for over
          forty years, and is an internationally respected authority on the
          Chinese health systems of Chi Kung and Tai Chi. To find out more,

          “Master Kam Chuen Lam’s new book about dealing with anxiety is a
          revelation on its own. During my daily interaction with dental
          patients, I come across a big percentage of anxiety cases. I have been
          aiming to incorporate Master Kam Chuen Lam’s&nbsp;relaxation
          techniques during treatment. As a result, patients often relax so much
          that they're telling us when they get off the dental chair that they
          feel as if they had a good rest! It is without a doubt, that in this
          book, various daily issues are addressed in an effective manner.
          Conventional Western medicine has no ammunition to combat stress or
          anxiety for everyday life or work. Look no further, Master Kam Chuen
          Lam's new book provides you with the essential elements to survive
          today's hectic lifestyle and emerge unscathed with simple techniques.
          It’s the first time I've come across such an informative and
          to-the-point read. … It is a beacon of hope in today's jungle.”<br />—<strong

        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Master Kam Chuen Lam</strong>&nbsp;has been a traditional
          Chinese healer for over forty years.&nbsp;He is also an
          internationally respected authority in the Chinese health systems of
          qigong and tai chi. He has produced over ten titles in these subjects
          and they have been sold across the world in over seventeen
          languages.<br /><br /><strong>Grandmaster Yu Yongnian </strong>wrote
          the foreword to this workbook months before his death at age 94. He
          was the world’s leading authority on the rare qigong system known as
          “standing like a tree.” As a medical doctor trained in Western
          medicine, he brought the health benefits of this ancient system into
          hospitals and clinics throughout China. He was a member of China’s
          National Qigong Research Council and was a consultant to the
          American-Chinese Qigong Research Group. He was also a consultant to
          the Da Cheng Chuan Zhan Zhuang Chi Kung Research Groups (Europe).<br /><br />Professor
          Yu travelled and taught in both Asian and European countries. He
          supervised the production of Master Kam Chuen Lam’s first book, The
          Way of Energy, and appears in both The Way of Power and its companion
          video in a rare demonstration of his teaching methods and power.<br />
