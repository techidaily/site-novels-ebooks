            Many people have experienced such unusual phenomena as dreams that
            later seem to correspond with unforeseeable events, thinking of a
            long-lost friend just before he or she unexpectedly calls, or the
            ability to "feel" the presence of deceased loved ones. What many do
            not realize is that these types of experiences have been researched
            for more than a century by eminent scientists, including Nobel
            laureates. Most of these researchers have concluded that some of
            these phenomena do occur, although we are far from explaining them
            to everyone's satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is the first in almost 40 years to provide a comprehensive
            scientific overview of research in the field of parapsychology,
            explaining what we know and don't know about so-called psi
            phenomena, such as "telepathy," "precognition" or "psychokinesis."
            Contributors evaluate the evidence for these phenomena, accounting
            for factors such as selective memory, wish fulfillment and incorrect
            methods or analyses, in some cases offering psychological, physical
            and biological theories.
