            >“<i>The Secret Language of Spirit</i> is the result of many years
            of dynamic mediumship. It soars with hope and conviction.” —Whitley
            Strieber, #1 <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author</b
          ><br /><br /><i>The Secret Language of Spirit</i> is the culmination
          of award-winning author and psychic medium William Stillman’s wisdom
          and insights in a fascinating exploration of the sometimes blatant,
          sometimes hidden spiritual symbolism in our everyday lives. With
          accessible language, easy-to-understand explanations, and fascinating
          anecdotes, Stillman introduces to the open-minded layperson an
          alternate lens through which to view daily interactions with
          Spirit.<br /><br />Topics unique to this compelling new work include:A
          thorough explanation of Heaven’s inner workingsRecognizing
          Spirit-speak—the silent but ever-present signs and signals that
          surround usDecoding symbolic patterns found in nature, dreams, our
          names, and the manifestation of “threes”Associative links in memory
          that correlate spiritually to music and scents<br /><br />Stillman’s
          most powerful observations may be found in the chapter that correlates
          spiritual sensitivity with persons with autism, mental illness, and
          dementia—individuals whose “gibberish” is often dismissed as pathology
          but may actually provide glimpses into another realm.<br /><br /><i
            >The Secret Language of Spirit</i
          >
          concludes with an empowering chapter that addresses the concepts of
          abundance and achieving authenticity with Love’s Foot Rule—12
          fundamental tenets. Stillman also introduces the principles of
          passion, pursuit, and prosperity, and how to manifest them in concert
          with Spirit.<br /><br />“Particularly illuminating are the connections
          he makes in the communications of people with dementia, mental illness
          and autism. This pioneering book offers insights that will both inform
          and inspire readers.” —Raymond Moody, author of <i>Life After Life</i>
