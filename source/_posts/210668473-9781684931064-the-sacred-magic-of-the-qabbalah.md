            The Sacred Magic of the Qabbalah (1936) by writer and mystic Manly
            P. Hall, explores the doctrines of the Qabbalah, an ancient
            tradition that investigates the science and mystery of divine names
            and numbers.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Author, lecturer, and mystic Manly P. Hall (b. 1901, d. 1990) wrote
            over 150 books and pamphlets, countless essays, and gave thousands
            of lectures over his 70-year career. Canadian-born, young Hall was
            first led to mysticism when he moved to Los Angeles at the age of
            18. As a preacher and lecturer at the Church of the People in the
            1920s, Hall shared the wisdom of Pythagoras, Plato, and the
            teachings of ancient traditions.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            During these years, he also met his wealthy patrons, Carolyn Lloyd,
            and her daughter, Estelle. With their financial backing, Hall was
            able to expand his research across the globe, learning more about
            age-old religions and amassing a sizeable library of rare books that
            he sent back to Los Angeles. In later years, these books would be
            collected at the Philosophical Research Society, a center of wisdom
            and learning.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            A prolific writer, Hall wrote consistently throughout his career,
            with titles like The Secret Teachings of All Ages (1928) and
            Lectures in Ancient Philosophy: An Introduction to Practical Ideals
            (1984). He also lectured frequently, attracting a record-setting
            audience at Carnegie Hall in 1942 with his talk titled "The Secret
            Destiny of America."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The Sacred Magic of the Qabbalah is one of Hall's earlier works,
            first published in 1929 and republished in 1936.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The work, while short, is broken into three distinct parts. Part one
            is titled Keys of the Sacred Wisdom, and describes the preparatory
            work that a student of the Qabbalah must do before being pure enough
            to receive these teachings. They must only be motivated by the
            "highest motives and purest ideals" if they hope to gain true
            understanding. This section also introduces the reader to the
            importance of the twenty-two hieroglyphic letters of the Hebrew
            alphabet and the ten sacred numbers. It is from the interactions of
            these letters that all creation originates.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Part two is titled The Mystery of the Numbers. "The ancient
            Qabbalistic magic of the philosophers had nothing to do with
            fortune-telling, divination, or the so-called art of numerology..."
            Hall warns.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            This section explains the significance of the numbers one through
            ten. The number two, for example, is "symbolic of the dual system of
            human thought, which views everything either from the standpoint of
            opposites or comparison. Things are judged in their relation to
            other things, but seldom, if ever, weighed and measured according to
            their own intrinsic merits." It is only the mystic who sees that
            everything in creation can only be judged on its own merits.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In part three, The Power of Invocation and the Science of Sacred
            Names, Hall explains the truth behind the ancient rituals of past
            ceremonial magicians. No need to draw a special circle and carefully
            place swords and scepters within it. The trappings of ritual are
            merely a metaphor. For "...the true Magus stood in the center of his
            circle, but the circle was the sphere of his experiences...for the
            circle is his own aura...The true magician was robed in the white
            garments of a purified body...he carried the living offerings of his
            daily labors, and there with the vowels and consonants of the
            celestial alphabet as his own being he blazed forth in the living
            name that invokes all things."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Christianity, Hall argued, has maintained the "crystallized,
            external ritual" of magic, but the "sublime magic...is missing." It
            is form without function and leaves the Christian student with a
            hungry soul.&nbsp;
