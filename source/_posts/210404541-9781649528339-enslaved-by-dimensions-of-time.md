            This book--Enslaved by the Dimensions of Time--is designed to
            seamlessly move the reader from the basic understanding of the
            Finite nature of Time essence in our life to its intricate nature of
            Infinite Time Dimension, where it merges with the divine in
            fulfillment of the everlasting purpose of God for all things created
            by Him. It explains that the entity called "Time" is truly the
            driver of our life and destiny and requires Consistency and Focus as
            its vital components in order to keep pace with it, if we are really
            determined to accomplish much in our earthly life cycle.

            Enslaved by the Dimensions of Time is a thought-provoking book that
            takes a rare view of the extended impact of Finite Time Dimension as
            the ultimate driver of the vehicle of one's life in all spheres of
            the human existence, and the Infinite Time Dimension as the master
            regulator of the Time of our life at both the physical and the
            spiritual level of existence. The author believes that it is not
            proper to talk about managing the Time but to talk about working
            with the vital components of Time--Consistency and Focus--to avoid
            being trapped in a secular motion where the person is working
            against the Time instead of moving in strides with its ultimate
            purpose in the life of the individual. Have you ever wondered about
            the divine purpose of Time in the nature of your physical existence
            in life? Is Time a physical entity or ethereal energy on a linear,
            divine spiritual mission which no human entity is able to decipher?
            How does Time become so intricately involved in the blueprint of
            every aspects of our earthly existence, and has earned a notoriety
            for not being a respecter of persons? In this book--Enslaved by the
            Dimensions of Time--you will find out how much of your Time actually
            belongs to you, and why a significant measure of your Time is lost
            operating in the Spiritual Time Zone rather than in the Physical
            Time Zone. Suffice it to say that as ephemeral as Time is, you may
            be surprised to learn that it is truly the driver of the vehicle of
            your life.
