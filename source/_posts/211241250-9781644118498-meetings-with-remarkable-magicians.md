          • Explores the author’s extensive connections with infamous occultists
          and organizations, including Genesis P-Orridge and Thee Temple Ov
          Psychick Youth, Anton LaVey and the Church of Satan, and the Ordo
          Templi Orientis<br /><br />• Details the underlying occult impulses
          and magical experiences guiding the author’s artistic journey, his
          experiences in psychedelic culture and the punk subculture, and his
          experimentation with sex magic, occulture, and sigil magic<br /><br />What
          does it mean to live a life as an occultist? There may be no single
          answer, but for Carl Abrahamsson, it has entailed work in music, art,
          and film as well as deep engagement with renowned occult figures and
          organizations for more than 40 years.<br /><br />Illustrating the
          possibilities of a life infused with magic, Abrahamsson reflects on
          his decades spent in the company of some of the most unconventional
          thinkers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He reveals his
          involvement with psychedelic culture, the punk subculture, and
          numerous occult figures and organizations, including Genesis P-Orridge
          and Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, Anton LaVey’s Church of Satan, the
          Ordo Templi Orientis, and a branch of the American Golden Dawn.<br /><br />Interwoven
          with his occult experiences and meetings with infamous practitioners
          of magic, Abrahamsson describes his evolution as a multidisciplinary
          artist, always imbuing his diverse artistic practice with a developing
          occult philosophy. He also details his ongoing efforts to disseminate
          the occult arts via publishing companies like Psychick Release,
          Looking Glass Press, Edda Publishing, Trapart Books, and the
          occultural journal <i>The Fenris Wolf—</i>as well as fieldwork in
          Tibet, Nepal, and India through the Institute of Comparative
          Magico-anthropology. Through each encounter and reflection on the
          magical, shamanic, and mystical practices that structured his own
          life, Abrahamsson illuminates how it’s possible to experience a life
          of wisdom and miracles.
