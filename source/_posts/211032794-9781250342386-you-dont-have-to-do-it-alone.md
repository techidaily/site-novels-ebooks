              A celebration of friendship and community from bestselling author
              Mark Nepo </b
            ><br /><br />
            In his newest book, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mark
            Nepo turns his attention to the value of community, offering another
            insightful and inspiring take on our shared human experience.
            <i>You Don’t Have to Do It Alone</i> is an earnest exploration and
            joyous affirmation of one of the most important aspects of being
            human: friendship.<br /><br />Sharing examples from history,
            mythology, and his own life, Mark unravels the nuances of close
            friendships, and reveals how a true friend can be the key to our own
            aliveness—because only in the presence of unconditional love can we
            feel safe enough to be who we truly are. Journal prompts and
            thought-provoking quotes from notable philosophers enhance Mark’s
            reflections, providing readers with the tools necessary to
            understand and cultivate the friendships in their own lives.<br /><br />Mark
            Nepo explores all that it takes to love another and be loved,
            ultimately showing that—despite what we’ve been taught—you don’t
            have to do it alone.

          "'If you are moved.' That is how my friend, Mark Nepo, asked if I
          would want to make a statement about his new book about friendship. I
          am moved by Mark Nepo. I am moved by his words and ideas. I am moved
          by my friendships that nourish me. Friendship is the music of my life.
          Like the lyrics of any great, old song, when I connect with a friend,
          regardless of the time separated, I fall right into the rhythm and
          memory of intimacy and sharing and I am always better for it. Mark
          explores this in the way that only Mark Nepo can. Intricate yet
          understandable. Sustained and yet immediate. The shared sight of each
          other’s souls. Friendship, beautiful friendship."<br />—<b
            >Jamie Lee Curtis</b
          >, actress and producer<br /><br />"Just as we often take the air we
          breathe for granted, so too can we forget how miraculous friendships
          can be. In this deeply insightful book, Mark Nepo shows us how to
          develop and cultivate these crucial relationships. We are all better
          people for reading Mark's work, and in this wise guide to platonic
          love, he has written about one of the most important subjects yet."<br /><b
            >—Arianna Huffington</b
          >, founder &amp; CEO of Thrive Global<br /><br />"Mark Nepo is one of
          our most gifted poets, essayists, and spiritual guides. His
          vulnerable, hopeful and beautifully-written books have made him feel
          like a soul friend to millions who’ve never met him. As one who’s had
          the privilege of a long-time friendship with Mark, I can attest that
          friendship is not just another topic for him: it’s the fabric of his
          life, a fabric of mutual support and blessing with people near and
          far. Now he’s written a book that will help us deepen the friendships
          on which we depend. Amid the challenges of being fully human in our
          era, how reassuring to be reminded that we don’t have to do it
          alone!"<br />—<b>Parker J. Palmer</b>, author of<i>
            On the Brink of Everything, Let Your Life Speak, </i
          >and<i> Healing the Heart of Democracy<br /></i><br />"What an
          exquisite act of friendship this beautiful book is. It is also
          'medicine in words,' to quote the author, offering the most hesitant
          among us ways to welcome the appreciation and authenticity that are
          friendship’s most enduring gifts."<br /><b>—Stephanie Dowrick, PhD.</b

          ><br /><br />"In this eloquent, essential compendium of friendship,
          Mark Nepo offers a roadmap to platonic intimacy in an age of
          increasing loneliness. Full of heartrending stories, timeless wisdom,
          and hard-won insights from the author himself,
          <i>You Don't Have to Do It Alone</i> reminds us that friendship is a
          noble endeavor - 'the vocation of seeking truth together' – that
          deepens the soul and enriches our lives immeasurably. I loved it."<br />—<b

          <i>Lessons from an American Stoic: How Emerson Can Change Your Life</i
          ><br /><br />"I would not be the poet or human being I am without the
          daily friendship of Mark Nepo’s healing words. Every one of his books
          has become a companion on the journey, his teachings drawn from the
          deeper well of his own hard-won wisdom. I will read
          <i>You Don’t Have to Do It Alone </i>again and again, each time I need
          to remember the “inlets of care” in which we discover “the depth of
          who we truly are.” Savor this new book in the morning before your day
          begins, or at night before sleep, and see how connection and wonder
          will open your heart, and fill it to the brim."<br />—<b

          Nepo illuminates the nuanced facets of friendship, offering us a
          window into the mysterious goodness, profound truth, and exquisite
          beauty that can be found within these life-giving relationships.

          that it requires us to taste, savor and embody what he so delicately

          discuss love, friendship, and community. His gentle approach to asking
          one to contemplate a new idea is powerful and filled with love. Read
          this one for your soul."<br /><b>—Rev. Dr. Michelle Wadleigh</b>,

          book is a tonic for making friendship a lifelong practice. A trove of
          wisdom on the nature of friendship. A call to reflect on your own
          friendships in a world where, for many of us, loneliness threatens our
          wellbeing, our livelihoods and our lifespans. This is a book to return
