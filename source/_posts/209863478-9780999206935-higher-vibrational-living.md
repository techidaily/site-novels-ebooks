            Higher vibrational living means something different to everyone, and
            your path is as unique as your fingerprint. Understanding your birth
            chart is a way to honor the uniqueness of who you are and to see
            what life themes you are dealing with, what challenges and
            vulnerabilities you have, and how to honor your true self.&nbsp;
            Essential oils provide access to taking charge of your own healing
            process and finding balance and harmony with who you are.&nbsp; This
            book will guide you step by step through the process of
            understanding your astrology chart, using essential oils based on
            your chart, and applying them to balance your acupuncture meridian
            system. If you are new astrology, essential oils, or Chinese
            medicine, this book will give you a solid foundation to work with
            these healing modalities effectively. If you are knowledgeable in
            one or more of these areas, this process will open up a new
            dimension of self-awareness and transformation. By integrating
            astrology, Chinese medicine, and essential oils, you can support
            yourself in coming into harmony and balance physically, emotionally,
            and spiritually. You will also learn how to increase your
            vibrational level to break free from old unhealthy patterns and to
            move into a higher level of consciousness. You will find a path to
            healing and personal transformation through increasing your
            self-awareness, raising your vibrational level, and harnessing your
            full potential.

          This book is a valuable guide for anyone ready to discover their true
          self - physically, mentally, and spiritually with the influence of
          Traditional Chinese Medicine, essential oils, and astrology. There is
          no other easy-to-read literature in existence that helps you fully
          understand your astrological birth chart so that you may activate
          acupressure points using essential oils so that you can gain a clear
          and full understanding of who you are and your purpose in life.&nbsp;

          Open this book and discover a map to a highly evolved form of
          consciousness, connection to body and cosmos, and healing.&nbsp;Higher
          Vibrational Living&nbsp;contains the potential to change your view of
          the world within and without. This is an immensely ambitious gift of
          love. The use of the connection to the cosmic patterns of astrology
          and the loving aid of the plant kingdom is extremely
          powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp;This book is a tapestry of what these two women
          have discovered and continue to explore between traditional wisdom
          systems and an evolving exploration of the energetic nature of the
          body. This is what is always available to us when we participate in
          self-healing and by holographic extension, a route to the healing of
          the human species. &nbsp;Sarah Fuhro,&nbsp;Star-Flower
