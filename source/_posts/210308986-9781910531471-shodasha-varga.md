            The Shodasa Vargas or sixteen divisional charts are an essential
            technique that is studied in vedic astrology in order to understand
            the true nature of an individual. Each varga focuses on a different
            area of life, and together they represent the complete picture,
            reflecting human consciousness from reality to the subconscious.
            Komilla Sutton unravels the sixteen vargas and their secrets through
            the in-depth study of case histories that include Sri Ramana
            Maharshi, Bill Clinton, Prince William, Bill Gates, Sri Aurobindo,
            Oprah Winfrey, Julia Roberts, George Clooney, Michael Jackson and
            many more. She explains the navamsha techniques of relationship
            compatibility, karakamsha, the atmakaraka in navamsha, how to
            analyse dasha and transits with vargas, plus vimshopaka, visheshika
            amsha and finally, appropriate remedies. This book is perfect for
            all students of vedic astrology, from beginner level to advanced.

          Shodasha Varga&nbsp;may sound daunting, but that's because it is the
          Sanskrit term for the 16 charts (including the natal chart) that are
          important components of Vedic astrology, the horoscopic system used in
          India for almost 2000 years. The two words literally mean
          16&nbsp;(shodasha)&nbsp;parts or divisions&nbsp;(vargas)&nbsp;and
          while the concept may sound complex, it is actually quite
          straightforward, and the charts are easy to compute, with or without
          the use of a computer program.
        </p>
        <p>
          Komilla Sutton, an extremely knowledgeable and well-respected
          astrologer, author, and teacher, presents the material in a clear,
          concise, and well-written manner, making the calculations and
          interpretations easy to understand for any level even if this is your
          first foray into Vedic astrology. She explains each chart's specific
          meanings with clarity and intelligence, exemplifying the simplicity
          yet complexity with which all Indian texts are written. According to
          Sutton: "The shodasha vargas or sixteen divisional charts are studied
          in Vedic astrology to understand the true nature of an individual.
          Each varga focuses on a different area of life and together they
          represent the complete picture. They reflect human consciousness, from
          reality to the subconscious." (p. 1) These areas of life include but
          are not limited to money, siblings, parents, happiness, marriage,
          children, spirituality, education, career, mental strength, and
          general well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vargas are formed by dividing each zodiacal sign of 30 degrees by
          the number represented by the particular divisional chart. Take the
          example of the navamsha (ninth) divisional chart, which, aside from
          the natal horoscope, is the most important varga. We divide each sign
          into nine equal sections of three degrees 30 minutes called navamshas
          totaling 108 navamshas in the 360-degree zodiac. Each divisional chart
          is calculated in a similar fashion and is based on a similar concept
          as the system of Harmonics, formulated by the late John Addey and more
          recently popularized by David Hamblin. In fact, Addey and the late B.
          V. Raman, a very well-known Indian astrologer, author, and publisher
          of&nbsp;The Astrological Magazine,&nbsp;corresponded since Addey
          recognized the similarities between vargas and harmonic charts and
          expressed the hope that harmonics would lead to
          a&nbsp;&nbsp;unification of Eastern and Western astrological
          traditions. Sutton spends an entire chapter on each Varga chart,
          thoroughly explaining with diagrams and tables how to calculate each
          one, and another chapter on how to analyze the planetary periods (
          dashas) and transits through the vargas. She shows how each divisional
          chart is interpreted on its own, and in relationship to the rashi
          (Sanskrit for "natal chart") and navamsha. The author cannot emphasize
          enough how important it is to always use the natal and navamsha charts
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sutton explains: "The navamsha and rashi charts cannot be separated,
          like the flower and perfume, body and soul, physical and mental.
          Navamsha is described as the relationship chart but it is much more.
          It is the foundation on which the rashi rests as well as the position
          where one goes forward from the rashi. In the cyclical nature of Vedic
          astrology, the navamsha is both the past and the future, the
          foundation and the next steps. The rashi chart is never analyzed
          without the navamsha. While other varga charts are used to highlight
          specific areas of the chart, the navamsha is used to determine every
          aspect." (p. 96)
        </p>

          The author utilizes many celebrity charts from politicians to movie
          stars to spiritual leaders to show how the position of the birth
          planets in each varga influences and defines the area of life that the
          varga represents. The interpretations are compiled from a variety of
          Indian classical texts but the icing on the cake is what Sutton brings
          to these explanations from years of experience as an astrological
          consultant. In the real
