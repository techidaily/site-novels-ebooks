          <p>
            Higher Learning for Higher Activities is the story of a young man
            who joins the military and, shortly after, loses his father. His
            life is changed forever from this sudden loss of the greater
            stability his father gave him, and his military career and his
            marriage go down in flames. Coping with life becomes more and more
            difficult. His only solace is the freedom the road gives him, and
            hitchhiking becomes a way of life and a search to find anything to
            fill the emotional vacancy in his soul. One day, through a series of
            unbelievable coincidences, he finds something that holds his
            attention and begins a four decades-long journey that eventually
            leads to an unveiling he never could have imagined. Only in
            retrospect can he see the steps that brought him to a place in his
            life he didn't have a clue he was headed toward. And when he
            arrived, he found the difficulty in his acceptance was his own
            intellect. His learning had been, as his teacher stressed,
            step-by-step, and so much had to be left behind to make way for the
            new. There were many times he thought he was a slacker, but he never
            gave up. His love of the search and his perseverance finally pay
            off, and he learns the truth of the Law of Laws.
