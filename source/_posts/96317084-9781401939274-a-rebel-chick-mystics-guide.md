          This is a book for brave, nonconformist women (or for those who aspire
          to be), written from the heart and soul of a spiritual rocker chick.
          Lifelong psychic <b>Lisa Marie Selow</b> leads you to uncover your
          true self, reveal your life purpose, and carve out your spiritual
          path. She invites you to engage in <i>positive rebellion</i> by
          subverting your good-girl persona, letting go of limiting beliefs that
          you’ve inherited, and creating your own definition of perfect. Lisa
          encourages you to be a different type of rebel, one that defies the
          stereotype of a misfit loner without a cause. Instead, you’re called
          to make a difference, rocking the world with your unique gifts and
          talents.<br /><br />Through enjoyable, engaging exercises, you’ll
          create your very own manual for living according to your own rules.
          You can, as a modern mystic, drop out of the School of Hard Knocks,
          for instance. Lisa shares compelling stories from her own life as well
          as those of other women (including mentors from history) to illustrate
          how you can radically rewrite your life story.<br /><br />Starting
          your journey from the premise that you already are perfect,
          <i>A Rebel Chick Mystic’s Guide</i> will help you excavate the real
          you—and, in the process, you’ll be guided to design action plans to
          move forward with the dreams and goals that make you the unique and
          amazing person you are.
