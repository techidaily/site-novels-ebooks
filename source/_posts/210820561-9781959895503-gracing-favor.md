          <p>
            In a world filled with instabilities, crises, and chaos, it can
            sometimes seem
          </p>
          <p>
            impossible to maintain your peace. But in these despairing times,
            God will send
          </p>
          <p>
            his servants as a beacon of hope, and anoint them to deliver a
            message that
          </p>
          <p>
            destroys bondages and removes burdens from the lives of His people.
            I believe
          </p>
          <p>
            that Dr. Tobe Momah is one of those servants, and Gracing Favor is
            that message.
          </p>
          <p>
            This powerful message is conveyed in the book of Esther-a dramatic
            account
          </p>
          <p>
            of God's special purpose for His people, His timeless love, the
            unsurpassed favor
          </p>
          <p>
            His presence brings, and the courage and responsibility that comes
            along with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Esther-though a Jewish woman in a foreign land-became the Queen of
            Persia
          </p>
          <p>because of God's gracing favor (Esther 2:17).</p>
          <p>
            As you read this book, you will learn that the anointing of God may
            bring you to
          </p>
          <p>
            the palace, but it is His grace and favor that will sustain you upon
            arriving there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ascendancy of Haman, the king's official, was never a threat to
            Esther, her
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle (Mordecai), or their Jewish nation, because God had already
            determined
          </p>
          <p>
            to take what the enemy meant for evil and work it together for their
            good. And
          </p>
          <p>when God promotes, no Haman can demote!</p>

          <p>About the book</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>There is a realm of favor the last-day Church will enter the</p>
          <p>prior generations would have only dreamt of. Th at realm is the</p>
          <p>realm called GRACING FAVOR. It is a two leaved gate that</p>
          <p>
            guarantees the Church will have "For (their) shame...double; and
          </p>
          <p>
            for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: (and) therefore
          </p>
          <p>
            in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall
            be
          </p>
          <p>unto them" (Isaiah 61:7).</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The latter day Church will taste double for their trouble! In
            Proverbs 16:15, the
          </p>
          <p>
            wise man said "In the light of the king's countenance is life; and
            his favor is as a
          </p>
          <p>
            cloud of the latter rain." That latter rain cloud is earmarked to
            surround the last
          </p>
          <p>days Church (according to James 5:7-9).</p>
          <p>
            The signature of the last day Church will be unparalleled favor
            characterized by
          </p>
          <p>
            a favor to get, and a grace to stand. These ones, like Queen Esther,
            will go from
          </p>
          <p>
            nonentity to numero uno of their time. This lifting was, however, a
            product of
          </p>
          <p>GRACING FAVOR.</p>
          <p>
            In Esther 2:17, the Bible says "...the king loved Esther above all
            the women, and
          </p>
          <p>
            she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins;
            so that he set
          </p>
          <p>
            the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of
            Vashti."
