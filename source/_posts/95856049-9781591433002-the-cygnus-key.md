          New evidence showing that the earliest origins of human culture,
          religion, and technology derive from the lost world of the Denisovans
          <br /><br />• Explains how Göbekli Tepe and the Giza pyramids are
          aligned with the constellation of Cygnus and show evidence of enhanced
          sound-acoustic technology <br /><br />• Traces the origins of Göbekli
          Tepe and the Giza pyramids to the Denisovans, a previously unknown
          human population remembered in myth as a race of giants <br /><br />•
          Shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus as the origin point for the
          human soul is as much as 45,000 years old and originally came from
          southern Siberia <br /><br />Built at the end of the last ice age
          around 9600 BCE, Göbekli Tepe in southeast Turkey was designed to
          align with the constellation of the celestial swan, Cygnus--a fact
          confirmed by the discovery at the site of a tiny bone plaque carved
          with the three key stars of Cygnus. Remarkably, the three main
          pyramids at Giza in Egypt, including the Great Pyramid, align with the
          same three stars. But where did this ancient veneration of Cygnus come
          from? <br /><br />Showing that Cygnus was once seen as a portal to the
          sky-world, Andrew Collins reveals how, at both sites, the attention
          toward this star group is linked with sound acoustics and the use of
          musical intervals “discovered” thousands of years later by the Greek
          mathematician Pythagoras. Collins traces these ideas as well as early
          advances in human technology and cosmology back to the Altai-Baikal
          region of Russian Siberia, where the cult of the swan flourished as
          much as 20,000 years ago. He shows how these concepts, including a
          complex numeric system based on long-term eclipse cycles, are derived
          from an extinct human population known as the Denisovans. Not only
          were they of exceptional size--the ancient giants of myth--but
          archaeological discoveries show that this previously unrecognized
          human population achieved an advanced level of culture, including the
          use of high-speed drilling techniques and the creation of musical
          instruments. <br /><br />The author explains how the stars of Cygnus
          coincided with the turning point of the heavens at the moment the
          Denisovan legacy was handed to the first human societies in southern
          Siberia 45,000 years ago, catalyzing beliefs in swan ancestry and an
          understanding of Cygnus as the source of cosmic creation. It also led
          to powerful ideas involving the Milky Way’s Dark Rift, viewed as the
          Path of Souls and the sky-road shamans travel to reach the sky-world.
          He explores how their sound technology and ancient cosmologies were
          carried into the West, flowering first at Göbekli Tepe and then later
          in Egypt’s Nile Valley. Collins shows how the ancient belief in Cygnus
          as the source of creation can also be found in many other cultures
          around the world, further confirming the role played by the Denisovan
          legacy in the genesis of human civilization.

          “A dynamic quest to discover the cosmology of our earliest ancestors
          and its relevance today. Collins takes us on a convincing journey
          following the lore of the constellation of Cygnus. From Göbekli Tepe
          to the pyramids of Egypt and the archaic myths of Greece, we are led
          to humanity’s ultimate psycho-spiritual roots in the Paleolithic world
          of Russian Siberia and the realm of the Denisovans. A triumph.”
