            <strong>I was DEAD.&nbsp;No heartbeat.&nbsp;No breath</strong
            >.&nbsp;<strong>My body lay</strong> <strong>lifeless</strong> on
            the barn floor below me after I returned from my experience in
            "Heaven" where I spoke to grandparents long-dead, Angels, beings of
            Light and more.&nbsp;It would be decades before I realized that this
            life-altering "accident" was no accident at all.&nbsp;Rather it was
            the <strong>"trigger event"</strong> that would set me on my
            lifelong path of seeking spiritual TRUTHS about the soul, psychic
            phenomenon, and consciousness that would one day lead to my
            realization that I incarnated in this lifetime to pursue a mission
            with Seth, Christ, and the Angels... And that "they" had been
            guiding me all along.

              >Known by tens of millions of spiritual seekers around the
              world</strong
            >, the nonphysical entity known as "<strong><u>Seth</u></strong
            >" now continues his teachings, helping humanity understand our
            <strong>Timeless Truths about consciousness</strong> and how it has
            shaped the evolution of humanity for eternity.&nbsp;Seth continues
            connecting the dots between
            <strong>The Ancient Teachings</strong> of Christ and his original
            Seth Books that were once channeled through Jane Roberts,&nbsp;to
            the new <strong>Timeless Truth Series</strong> now channeled through
            <strong>Author/Medium Jackson Moore</strong>. &nbsp;Seth discusses
            herein the Timeless Truths behind our very existence, and all
            physical &amp; nonphysical reality within the universe we know, and
            in the many dimensions of reality beyond the one that we know.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>The immense personal power of the soul</strong> and all
            consciousness provides your physical body its life animation and it
            is very capable of creating worlds, inventions, ways, means,
            objects, events, and conditions that form our physical reality and
            evolve humanity as a species on this planet.&nbsp;Focusing upon the
            unlimited traits, characteristics, and creative abilities that we
            all have within our soul, Seth discusses fascinating truths about
            human consciousness, and provides examples using Jackson's
            experience when he died (<strong>Near Death Experience/NDE</strong>)
            in an accident as a child while playing on the farm where he grew up
            in upstate New York.&nbsp;&nbsp;In Seth's
            <strong>powerful teachings</strong>, he provides profound truths
            that literally vibrate to the core of the reader's soul and expands
            the consciousness of <u>your</u> immortal being
            within.&nbsp;However, as we also discover in this new book,
            <strong>The Nature Of Consciousness</strong>, the <u>Seth</u> entity
            that the world knows IS&nbsp;more than one entity.&nbsp;Rather it is
            a <strong>Conscious Collective</strong> that includes the Seth
            personality essence that authored all Seth Books prior to Timeless
            Truths, as well as many other personalities and even other
            entities.&nbsp;This includes "Seth2" from the original&nbsp;Seth
            Books, the <strong>"Christ" entity/consciousness</strong> and
            more.&nbsp;

              >Providing a continuity of truth teachings that transcends
              thousands of years</strong
            >, from the time of the Christ personalities to the spiritual
            seekers of today, this book serves as the
            <strong>fundamental foundation</strong> for the rest of Seth's
            Timeless Truth Series books to follow, that prepares the reader to
            continue growing and expanding the inner Self, which will shift and
            evolve their physical world and life experiences.&nbsp;<strong
