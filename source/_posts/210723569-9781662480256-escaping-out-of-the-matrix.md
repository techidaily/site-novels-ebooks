            I felt an urgency in writing this particular book as most of us are
            lost in a world that we no longer recognize, and we are all in
            desperate need of answers and guidance. The fact is, we have all
            been lied to and deceived as to who the god of the Old Testament is.
            Yahweh, Jehovah, and all those names for God in the Old Testament
            all belong to God the Father of Christ. We were taught that the god
            of the Old Testament--Yahweh--is the same God in the New
            Testament--the Father. This is a lie, and this is the greatest
            deception ever played out on mankind. All western religions have
            taught us that we are worthless, guilty sinners that must be
            condemned and punished. This is a lie that the church has instilled
            in our mass consciousness to control and enslave humanity. The truth
            is you are not the sinner. You are not the egoic mind or the body.
            You are the Spirit--an extension of God the Father Himself. The
            spirit is the only part of you that God the Father created, so this
            is the only part of you He sees. He does not look at your carnal
            mind or body, for He knows it was made in corruption.Gnostic Sacred
            text, specifically the Secret Book of John, tells us God the Father
            created man's eternal, perfect spirit while the god of the Old
            Testament--Yahweh--made the physical world that we see; he assembled
            man's soul, which imprisons the Spirit of God the Father through the
            process of reincarnation, karma, sin, and guilt. He created the body
            to give man an expiration date, which is death. This limits our time
            here in this world as he feared man gaining gnosis--knowledge of our
            true identity, the power within us, and how to use it. This is why
            Yahweh created the egoic carnal mind at enmity against God the
            Father--as he does not want us to awaken to the Truth of who we
            really are: an eternal, unchanging, innocent holy son of God the
            Father. God the Father only creates what is spiritual and eternal.
            Yahweh only creates what is physical; everything in it deteriorates,
            decays, and dies.This world and everything in it all belongs to
            Yahweh; all governments, kingdoms, world leaders, and
            megacorporations belong to him. Christ and God the Father's kingdom
            is spiritual. They want nothing of this physical world. The truth is
            the god of the Old Testament--Yahweh is a corrupt, egoic lesser god
            that wants to be worshiped by the whole world as God the Most High,
            the Father of Christ.In this book, I use Bible scriptures and sacred
            Gnostic text to discuss, show, and prove who God the Father is, who
            the god of the Old Testament is, and who we really are. Our true
            origins are documented in sacred Gnostic text, which the church
            desperately tried to destroy and eliminate from our recorded
            history. I will go over how the god of the Old Testament was created
            and how he has deceived the world to usher in his one-world
            government, currency, and religion, all worshiping him.The rulers of
            the world know that there is a great awakening happening throughout
            the world, and this is their greatest fear. They know that if we
            awaken the Spirit within, our Christ consciousness, they will lose
            their power and control over us; they will no longer be able to
            deceive, manipulate, and control us through fear, and their beast
            system will eventually collapse. This is why there is a war on
            consciousness. They are doing everything in their power to ensure we
            do not awaken to the truth.In this book, I reveal many truths that
            will empower you through the troubling times ahead. Knowing your
            true self, knowing the power within and how to use it, knowing the
            Father, knowing how to escape Yahweh's world matrix of
            reincarnation--this is your true power. I give you concepts, ideas,
            exercises, and tools that you need to awaken your true self: the
            divine Spirit within. These tools will help you eliminate most of
            your karma so you may escape Yahweh's matrix of reincarnation to
            ascend back to God the Father's kingdom in heaven. Yes,
            reincarnation was in the Bible; they took it out to control the
            people through fear of going to hell for eternity.
