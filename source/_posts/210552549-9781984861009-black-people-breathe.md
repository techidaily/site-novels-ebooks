            >A thoughtful, inclusive, and vividly illustrated guide to help
            Black people—and all people of color—heal from racial trauma using
            vital tools from an expert in mindfulness, meditation, and
            breathwork.</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />It is&nbsp;your right to survive. It is&nbsp;your
          right to thrive. Mindfulness and breathwork will help you do just
          that.<br />&nbsp;<br />Racism is more than just an interpersonal
          experience. It is a systemic injustice that affects the lives of Black
          people, and all people of color, in countless ways. Doctors and
          psychologists have discovered the wide-ranging—and often
          devastating—effects of racism on one’s emotional, physical, and mental
          health, from high blood pressure and heart problems to anxiety and
          depression. Yet&nbsp;studies show that mindfulness, meditation, and
          breathwork can significantly reduce these issues. This is where Zee
          Clarke comes in.<br />&nbsp;<br />In this powerful book, Clarke draws
          on her professional expertise and her lived experience as a Black
          woman to share mindfulness exercises, breathwork practices, and
          meditative tools centered on healing from and surviving racial trauma.
          Filled with deeply personal stories highlighting the many systemic
          challenges that people of color face, this mixture of guide and memoir
          offers&nbsp;thirty-three&nbsp;practical techniques based on the
          emotions elicited from these experiences. Whether you are coping with
          police brutality, racial profiling, microaggressions, or even imposter
          syndrome, <i>Black People Breathe</i> gives you the tools to process
          these complex feelings physically, mentally, and emotionally. Though
          this collection was created to facilitate healing for communities of
          color, it also offers allies insight into the discrimination and
          inequity that these communities face, creating a space for deeper
          empathy and the inspiration to drive change.<br />&nbsp;<br />Beautifully
          designed with gorgeous, vibrant illustrations, <i
            >Black People Breathe</i
          >
          takes a radically inclusive approach to mindfulness, allowing
          communities of color the opportunity to embark on a journey towards
          racial healing.

          “Zee Clarke’s beautifully illustrated book,
          <i>Black People Breathe</i>, is a go to reference book for every Black
          person, People of Color, and ally to understand the devastating health
          consequences of ongoing systemic racism, microaggressions, and other
          struggles<i>. Black People Breathe</i> will become a go to manual,
          charting a course towards how we can heal ourselves with breathwork
          and mindfulness so we not just survive, but thrive.”<b

          ><br />“In <i>Black People Breathe</i>, Zee Clarke captures how we can
          all be more aware, empathetic, and supportive as allies. She has
          opened my eyes wider to issues I’ve been aware of and discussing for
          several years. The magic with this book is that Zee’s personal touch
          completely expands my awareness, and gives me a new perspective that
          will propel me in my work moving forward. And, I plan to implement the
          breathing techniques into my own life. I am grateful to Zee for her
          honesty, vulnerability, and strength. I am recommending this book to
          all of my friends and colleagues, as we will all learn and grow by
          reading <i>Black People Breathe</i>.”<b

        <p>
          Founder of Reclaiming Flow, <b>Zee Clarke</b> leverages her toolkit of
          meditation, breathwork, yoga, and much more, to teach people of color
          how mindfulness can improve their well-being at work.&nbsp; She has
          trained Black employees at leading brands like Facebook and The North
          Face, and she teaches Black people across the nation who have never
          meditated before how to use mindfulness tools to heal from
          microaggressions, racism, and the anxiety, fear, and self-doubt that
          often can occur as a result.
