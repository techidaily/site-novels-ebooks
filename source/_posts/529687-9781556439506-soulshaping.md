              >An engaging, inspirational memoir that takes readers on a
              soul-searching journey toward heart-consciousness and spiritual
              authenticity</b
            ><br />&nbsp;<br />Ever since childhood, Jeff Brown did all the
            things he was supposed to do to become successful in the eyes of the
            world. He was on the Dean’s Honor List as an undergraduate. He won
            the Law and Medicine prize in law school and apprenticed with a top
            criminal lawyer. It had been Brown’s lifelong dream to practice
            criminal law and search for the truth in the courtroom.<br /><br />But
            then, on the verge of opening a law practice, he heard a little
            voice inside telling him to stop, just stop. With great difficulty,
            he honored this voice and began a heartfelt quest for the truth that
            lived within him. Although he didn’t realize it at the time, Brown
            was actually questing for his&nbsp;<i>innate image</i>, the
            essential being that he came into this lifetime to embody. He was
            searching for his authentic face. <br /><br />By going inside and
            connecting his spirituality with his emotional life, he learned
            essential lessons. By learning to surrender to the "School of Heart
            Knocks"—the school of life—the found his authentic face and embraced
            the call to write.<br />&nbsp;<br /><i>Soulshaping</i>&nbsp;is an
            inspiring memoir for anyone who has heard a whisper of something
            truer calling out to them amid the distractions of modern life.
            Jeff’s dramatic and often funny story takes readers through
            remarkably human experiences—emotional, physical, and economic—as he
            vividly recounts his journey to discover his soul’s purpose. A work
            of courageous self-creation,&nbsp;<i>Soulshaping</i>&nbsp;reminds us
            that we are all truly connected, that our seemingly isolated
            struggles are actually part of the shared human challenge to live a
            life that is heart-centered and soul-driven.

          "<i>Soulshaping </i>does an excellent job of demonstrating how we can
          listen to and follow our soul’s guidance in the midst of life."<br />–Ram
          Dass, spiritual teacher and author of <i>Be Here Now</i><br /><br />"I
          often refer to the dictionary at the end of this wonderful book to put
          new words to sacred experiences, fleeting understandings, and the
          bigger mysteries that seekers have pondered throughout history. The
          words are like bridges between my little self and my vaster
          consciousness that is free from fear and open to peace."<br />—Elizabeth
          Lesser, author of
          <i>Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow</i> and cofounder
          of the Omega Institute<br /><br />"This book is a role call for the
          soul. Jeff Brown is the kind of writer who invites you to swim in
          gasoline and then provides a match. This is no self-help book. This is
          a summons from the mountaintop and from the trenches. I am so grateful
          for Brown’s journey and his absolute genius in writing."<br />—Tama J.
          Kieves, best-selling author of
          <i>This Time I Dance! Creating the Work You Love</i
          ><br /><br />"Spiritual erotica! Jeff Brown lays down his soul on
          these pages for us to see ourselves. In so doing, he demonstrates a
          rare vulnerability, a wicked sense of humor, and a deeply personal
          insight into the human condition."<br />—Kathryn Beet, master yoga
          practitioner and owner of Yoga Space, Toronto<br /><br />"Jeff Brown
          takes readers on a journey seeking to find his inner self. It is a
          search for self-fulfillment, a field guide for life, and a quest for
          the meaning of life."<br />—Eddie Greenspan, QC, criminal lawyer and
          earnest defender of the presumption of innocence<br /><br />"<i
            >Soulshaping </i
          >is a beautiful story of one man’s spiritual journey that reveals the
          inspiring, yet often humbling, path of growth and self-transformation.
          Jeff Brown offers us a raw, honest, and humorous glimpse into the
          exploration of self, while also imploring us to celebrate the opening
          of the heart and the awakening of the soul—no matter where we are
          directed, what is revealed, or who shows up."<br />—Seane Corn,
          international yoga instructor and spiritual activist <br /><br />"<i
            >Soulshaping</i
          >
          is the story of one man’s journey of awakening and healing and is lit
          with epiphanies and hard-won psychospiritual savvy not just for the
          author, but for all of us. Jeff Brown has faced his dragons and has
          emerged from the flames with significant treasures and a
          soul-centered, refreshingly raw travelogue that is as readable as it
          is instructive. A brave book this is–a book that serves our own
          journey of awakening and healing, simply by being so unswervingly and
          nakedly human. This is not just another book about soul, but a book
          saturated <i>with</i> soul."<br />—Robert Augustus Masters, PhD,
          author of <i>Meeting the Dragon</i><br /><br />"If you don't have a
          gut reaction to this book, you may be dead! My heart completely opened
          up as I felt each page come alive with emotion. It’s a must-read for
          anyone on a spiritual path to identify and discover our powerful and
          majestic self."<br />—Jewels Johnson, host of
          <i>Law of Attraction Talk Radio </i><br /><br />"Tired of another
          by-the-numbers guide to spirituality? <i>Soulshaping </i>is the real
          deal, a gritty look at the reality of fully inhabiting your life. It
          may be the only soul-help book I have read that brings spirituality
          and psychology together in a grounded framework. I love the way Jeff
          Brown shows us how to shed our emotional debris and ego armor, while
          at the same time transforming all of it into the lessons we need.
          Nothing gets lost or misplaced—everything is grist for the soul mill!
          <i>Soulshaping</i> represents the next step in the spiritual
          transformation of Western culture, a perfect blend of Eastern
          mysticism and emotional healing. Brilliant and perfectly down to earth
          at the same time."<br />—Zeydl Hemrend, lawyer and film producer<br /><br />"Jeff
          Brown takes us on an intimate, compelling, enlivening, and often quite
          humorous set of adventures with many of today’s leading consciousness
          teachers on his journey to uncovering the deep truths that live at the
          heart of all spiritual paths."<br />—Robert Gass, EdD, workshop
          leader, spiritual activist, composer, performer, and recording artist
          <br /><br />"As a therapist and as a human being, I highly recommend
          <i>Soulshaping.</i> It is a must-read for anyone wanting to move
          beyond the profound emotional blocks of early wounding and gradually,
          very gradually, begin to awaken to increasing levels of
          self-acceptance through the wisdom and tenderness of their own
          essence. Through his school of 'heart knocks,' and with astonishing
          emotional authenticity, Jeff Brown implores us to embrace and fully
          'excavate' our Shadow, the seeming darkness within. Only by fully
          honoring all aspects of our journey (every wound, every person, every
          trauma) can we begin to accept and eventually honor all of who we
          are."<br />—John Pollard, MA, psychotherapist and spiritual director
          at Transformational Arts College <br /><br />"<i>Soulshaping</i> was
          the most valuable, engaging, and hard to put down book I read this
          year. This book goes way beyond the rote ‘how to’ presented in so many
          spiritual books and offers a sincere and true-life story of what it is
          really like to journey into the inner world of self-creation and to
          listen, truly listen, to that tiny voice inside. Jeff Brown is the
          real deal and he shows with heartfelt honesty that there is no
          ‘arrived’ when it comes to the quest of the spirit."<br />—Dr. Melissa
          West, international radio show host with Contact Talk Radio<br /><br /><i
            >“Soulshaping</i
          >
          is an insightful, thought-provoking testimonial, an autobiography of
          one man's spiritual journey to find a more authentic way of being…a
          refreshingly truthful, heartfelt account...I think this book will
          appeal to those who are seeking a more meaningful way of being. It is
          beautifully written and there is comfort in reading and relief in
          hearing.”<br />—<i>Bath Chronicle</i><br /><br />"<i>Soulshaping </i
          >is a direct expression of a powerful individual radiating his inner
          divine strength, while fully revealing wholeheartedly the human side
          of his earthly undertakings and allowing readers to capture meaningful
          wisdom, inspiration, a renewed sense of empowerment, and hope. Jeff
          Brown is a true pioneer with his endless dedication, commitment, and
          balanced expression that promotes authenticity and long-lived
          self-transformation. Cheers to him for his powerful service to
          humanity!"<br />—Dulcinea Contreras, founder and executive producer of
          Evolution Revolution Media Productions <br /><br />"Just as a sculptor
          shapes his clay on the wheel, Jeff Brown shapes his soul from the
          wheel of his life. An alluring and riveting journey, a definitive cure
          for soul-dysplasia, this book is real! Never before have I read a book
          so eagerly anticipating the next page—not because of a mystery
          unfolding, but because I wanted to see if Brown had my story right.
          For those on their soul journeys, this book will no doubt reveal a
          different vantage point to help them find their way."<br />—Susie
          Bonham-Craig,<b> </b>spiritual psychologist and author and host of
          <i>Wisdom Wide Open Radio</i><br /><br />"If I were to use words to
          describe my innermost feeling after reading <i>Soulshaping,</i> I
          would use two: true inspiration. I believe this book will be used as a
          ‘bible’ to those who truly need a guide for their journey. Jeff
          Brown’s life journey will truly inspire those who have started and
          then stopped, those who have a knowing, but don’t know where to begin,
          those who have despised their life due to some traumatic experience at
          some point in time, and will realize by reading this book that they
          can go on!"<br />—Laura Annicharico<br /><br />“Brown’s story is an
          emotionally raw, no-holds-barred account of life in the trenches along
          the spiritual path, and a guide to moving from survivalist behaviors
          and attitudes to living in tune with one’s higher purpose in the midst
          of the madness of modern life.”<br />—<i>ForeWord Reviews</i
          ><br /><br />“Rivetingly personal and profoundly universal,
          [<i>Soulshaping</i>] is for anyone who has heard a whisper of
          something truer calling out to them amid the distractions of modern
          life.”<i><br />—Spiritual Media Blog<br /><br /></i>“Offering much
          food for thought as [Jeff Brown] tells a story that many readers will
          find relation to when coming to terms with their own soul and their
          spirituality, <i>Soulshaping</i> is a heartily recommended read.”<br />—<i
            >The Midwest Book Review<br /><br /></i
          >“Through verdant prose Jeff, the wordsmith, leads us to authenticity
          through ‘the challenge of actualizing a soulful calling in a harsh
          landscape.’… Like a touchstone I will return to <i>Soulshaping</i> as
          I continue to weave my own web of soul-shaping.”<i
            ><br />—Food for Thought<br /></i
          ><br />“Through Brown’s passionate storytelling and insights, gleaned
          from his life journey, three powerful points emerge… The essence of
          life is that it is all a soul’s journey. The heart of the soul’s
          journey is to have a profound faith in the human experience. The
          process of realizing our soul’s calling is to feel our feelings fully
          until we discover what we need to learn. [<i>Soulshaping</i>] is a
          very inspiring book, and I recommend it both for people searching for
          hope and guidance in order to find meaning in their lives, and for
          those who have found meaning and would appreciate revisiting their
          journey.”<br />—<i>AHP Perspective<br /><br /></i>“This is a good book
          for anyone who has heard a little voice (or voices) about another way
          of life.”<br />—MyShelf.com<br /><br />“I found <i>Soulshaping</i> to
          be a wrenchingly personal and sometimes painful expression of Jeff's
          life journey… Jeff has a particularly engaging way of mapping out his
          text...a word wall that is a canvas for the verbal paint splashes that
          find their way into his writing.”<br />
          —Edie Weinstein, <i>The Bliss Blog, Beliefnet</i><br /><i><br /></i
          >“<i>Soulshaping </i>is a powerful memoir about how making different
          choices in life can change it for the better—if we only listen to our
          inner voice. … This book offers a good narrative and would be helpful
          to anyone trying to come to grips with their own life and soul
          path.”<br />

          optimal demonstration of walking one's true path. … Jeff Brown's
          brilliant formulas will immerse you in the school of heart knocks.
          <i>Soulshaping </i>will awaken parts of you and guide you&nbsp;on a
          deliberate purpose driven, soul searching journey.”<br />
          —<i>Intentional Conscious Parenting</i><br /><br />“<i>Soulshaping</i>
          is the journey of awakening for Jeff Brown, and is described so
          intricately, and shared so deeply, one could use this as a ‘template’
