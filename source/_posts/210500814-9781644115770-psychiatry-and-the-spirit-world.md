            >A psychiatrist’s comprehensive examination of evidence for the
            survival of consciousness after death</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains the author’s practice of psychiatric spirit
          release, centered on the spiritual and psychic aspects of emotional
          disturbance<br /><br />
          • Offers profound accounts of the survival of the spirit after death,
          from ancient times to the present day, including near-death
          experiences, out-of-body experiences, reincarnation, and dreams<br /><br />
          • Examines evidence for mediumship, clairvoyance, telepathy, and the
          psychic aspects of heart transplants<br /><br />
          After a twenty-year break from practice, Alan Sanderson returned to
          clinical psychiatry at age fifty-nine and soon realized that many of
          his patients were plagued by troublesome earthbound spirits, some of
          whom had been attached across lifetimes to multiple incarnations as
          well as multiple hosts. By talking with these attached spirits and
          persuading them to leave their hosts, Dr. Sanderson found remarkable
          success in the treatment of his patients.<br /><br />
          Now, more than 30 years later, Dr. Sanderson shares his extensive
          research on the afterlife, the survival of consciousness after
          physical death, and paranormal phenomena related to the spirit world.
          He explains his practice of psychiatric spirit release, centered on
          the spiritual and psychic aspects of emotional disturbance, and shares
          case studies complete with full accounts of treatment sessions. He
          offers first-hand accounts of the survival of the spirit after death,
          from ancient times to the present day, and explores end-of-life
          experiences, including what is witnessed by the living people in the
          room, as well as profound accounts of near-death experiences,
          out-of-body experiences, and reincarnation. He examines evidence for
          mediumship, clairvoyance, telepathy, and the psychic aspects of heart
          transplants. He also details cases of remote healing, further proving
          the existence of connections beyond the material world.<br /><br />
          Presenting a wealth of evidence, as well as suggestions for new
          treatment possibilities for mental health problems, Dr. Sanderson
          offers a comprehensive examination of spirit existence and the
          survival of consciousness after death.

        <p>
          Alan Sanderson (1931-2022), M.D., M.R.C.P., M.R.C.Psych., was a
          consultant psychiatrist who qualified in medicine at St. Thomas’s
          Hospital in London in 1954. After his retirement in 1998, he began
          lecturing on the practice of spirit release at the College of Psychic
          Studies in London. In 1999 he cofounded the Foundation for Spirit
          Release, which attracted more than 100 members. After the Foundation
          ended in 2012, Dr. Sanderson continued researching and writing on the
          survival of consciousness after death until his own passing in 2022.
