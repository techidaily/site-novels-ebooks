              longing for.”</b

              >—Marianne Williamson, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b
            ><br /><br />Why can’t positive thinking lead us all to more
            fulfilling lives? Because thinking is only part of the equation,
            according to spiritual teacher and bestselling author Moshe Gersht.
            The other part, the crucial part that can actually shape the life
            you want, is how you apply your beliefs. “Knowledge is just a seed
            in your mind,” writes Gersht. “What makes it grow is your inspired
            action.” This is the power he shares with his simple and accessible
            formula for actively pursuing the joy and fulfillment you’ve been
            longing for.<br /><br />The Three Conditions are surprisingly
            straightforward:<br /><br />• Through <b>Intention</b>, you’re
            choosing to live and experience the Truth of who you are<br />• By
            expressing <b>Certainty,</b> you’re trusting that the Universe is
            always directing and assisting you in experiencing your authentic
            Self<br />• <b>Joy</b> is the feeling of happiness that acts as the
            barometer of how aligned you are with intention and certainty<br /><br />With
            lucid insight and practices for reflection and growth, Gersht shows
            you how to embody these conditions more deeply each day—and tap in
            to your full power and potential.<br /><br />Rooted in the Torah
            tradition, Kaballa, and Chasidus, as well as an array of spiritual
            traditions, this book provides real-time tools to help you cultivate
            and practice intention, certainty, and joy right now. By following
            Moshe’s formula, you’ll start living the life you’re destined to
            live regardless of race, color, or creed. It will point you toward
            the <i>life</i> behind your life circumstances.<br /><br />“There
            are two things that matter most: what you believe about your Self
            and what you believe about the Universe,” says Gersht. “This guide
            is a reminder of the incredible power you have to choose what you
            believe—and how you are going to live.”
