            >The essential guide for people who have experienced alien contact
            and for those who love them.</b
          ><br /><br />It has been twenty years since the publication of
          <i>How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction</i> by Ann Druffel.
          This new book by UFO researcher Kathleen Marden is the essential
          handbook for this generation. This is the fundamental reference and
          guide for those who have experienced contact with nonhuman intelligent
          (NHI) entities, families &amp; friends of those “experiencers,” and
          anyone interested in alien abduction and contact and UFOs.<br /><br />The
          ten chapters in this book are based on years of research and access to
          the files of MUFON and the Dr. Edgar Mitchel Foundation for Research
          into Extraterrestrial and Extraordinary Encounters. Chapters
          include:Am I an abductee, a contactee, or an experiencer?How to
          investigate your contact experiencesWhen you discover that it isn’t
          ET: ghosts and paranormal phenomenaWhen you want it to stop: coping
          strategies and resistance techniques<br /><br />Wide-ranging,
          informative, and helpful, this is a book that will find a place as a
          crucial resource for anyone fascinated by visitations from other
          worlds.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Extraterrestrial Contact</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Finally, there is a (much needed and long awaited)
          practical handbook for anyone looking for guidance on how to
          comprehend, evaluate, and digest alien abduction memories into the
          framework of life in the 21st century.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. An
          eye-opening bridge for future generations, as it is predicted humanity
          will likely inhabit another planet by the end of the next century. If
          contact is inevitable, perhaps those who have been abducted will one
          day be honored as our evolutionary ambassadors.” —Jennifer W. Stein,
          Documentary Producer of <i>Travis: The True Story of Travis Walton</i
          ><br /><br />“Once again, author and investigator Kathleen Marden has
          made a remarkable contribution to the world of serious UFO literature.
          This wealth of practical, well-documented information contained in [<i
            >Extraterrestrial Contact</i
          >] will be invaluable to experiencers and abductees as well as to
          educators, mental health professionals, and to serious students of
          ufology worldwide.” —Peter Robbins, long-time assistant to pioneer UFO
          abduction researcher Budd Hopkins, author, and investigative writer

          overdue and will undoubtedly be an instrumental go-to manual for
          anyone haunted by their recurring dreams and half memories. A beacon
          for the lost in need of solace, and a reassurance they are not
          alone.There can never be enough praise for Kathleen Marden and her
          work, which will bring us closer to unraveling the abduction mystery,
          and empower people from all walks of life to shine the light on this
          reality." --Yvonne Smith, CHT, author of Chosen and Coronado
