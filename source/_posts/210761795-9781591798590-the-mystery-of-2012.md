            Are we coming to the end of a cosmic cycle? Will there be an age of
            awakening, or even an end to the world we know? For the first time,
            the leading authorities on the 2012 phenomenon are all given voice
            in a single book: The Mystery of 2012.<br />From the prophecies of
            the Mayan astronomers to modern predictions about social,
            ecological, and spiritual changes to our world, this comprehensive
            anthology offers you a chance to examine the mystery from every
            angle—and to decide for yourself whether 2012 will end with a
            whimper or a bang.<br />Whether you’re a skeptic, a true believer,
            or simply “2012 curious,” here is a thought-provoking exploration of
            this approaching landmark in human history.<br />The book includes
