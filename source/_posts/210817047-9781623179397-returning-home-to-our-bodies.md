            >For readers of adrienne maree brown, Staci K. Haines, and Robin
            Wall Kimmerer<br /><br />A body-based healing model that
            interrogates what we’ve been wrongly taught about hierarchies of
            nature and the body—and pushes back against the white supremacy,
            colonialism, patriarchy, and capitalism embedded in modern
            embodiment practices.</b
          ><br /><br />Pushing back against a consumerist, pleasure-centric
          somatics industry that privileges product over process,&nbsp;Abigail
          Rose Clarke reminds us that <i>truly</i> meaningful embodiment
          practice nurtures our relationships among self, nature, and
          community.<br /><br />Combining the rigor of the scientific method
          with the poetry and lyricism of movement and somatic studies, Clarke’s
          somatic learning system—The Embodied Life Method—centers the body as a
          guide through today’s most seemingly intractable social and
          environmental challenges, reclaiming the body as a source of
          liberatory comfort in times of great uncertainty and yet,
          possibility.&nbsp;<br /><br />With tools and practices to help us
          better understand and dismantle the many ways our bodies are
          weaponized to serve domination systems, topics covered include:<br /><br />Harnessing
          the vitality of curiosity and experimentationUsing nature as a guide
          to possibilityEmbracing the necessity of differenceExposing the lie of
          universal isolationDismantling the fallacy of hierarchyUncovering the
          truth of endless capacityAwe as a driving force for transformation<br />With
          methods honed over decades of inquiry, teaching, and practice,
          <i>Returning Home to Our Bodies</i> provides a lucid, body-based model
          of healing and restoration—one that imagines a world beyond systems of
          domination, marginalization, and isolation to nurture embodied,
          whole-community liberation.

          “In this book, Abigail Rose Clarke has synthesized some of the most
          important processes of our time and woven them into a single process.
          In a unique and radically new way, this book gives us simple and
          manageable ways to grasp what it means—and feels like—to be human.”<br />—Patty
          Townsend, developer of Embodyoga<br /><br />“<i
            >Returning Home to Our Bodies</i
          >
          is tenderly expressed and full of precious insights that remind even
          the most self-aware reader that being present in oneself is real,
          deliberate work.”<br />—Soleil Ho, cultural critic for the
          <i>San Francisco Chronicle<br /></i><br />“Abigail uses poetic,
          down-to-earth language to illuminate the magic of our bodies: the
          processes, rhythms, and science of being human that are, in fact,
          quite fantastical. With keen insight rooted in both spirituality and
          scholarship, this book describes how nature’s wisdom can inform our
          activism and support a radical reimagining of our bodies in
          relationship with the world.”<br />—Mira Weil, DTM, MPH, doctor of
          Tibetan medicine and sexual health educator<br /><br />“There is such
          a poetry to the way Abigail Rose Clarke coaxes a new understanding of
          our bodies into being in this book. You will find yourself marveling
          at what the body is made of, what it can do, and what it can reveal to
          us, if we are truly attentive to it. This book is both a guide and a
          companion in a quietly radical quest for changing how we experience
          ourselves and, from that, the world.”<br />—Tina Antolini, audio
          journalist, <i>The New York Times<br /></i><br />“Abigail’s book
          reminds us to look to our soft, gliding, attentive, and queer animal
          nature. So that we might practice presence. So that we might practice
          awe. So that we might heal, not as an end goal, but as an activity of
          our true nature. Thank you, Abigail. This book is a gift, and a
          celebration.”<br />—Autumn Brown, cohost of
          <i>How to Survive the End of the World<br /></i><br />“Somatic
          educator and embodied poet Abigail Rose Clarke invites you to come
          home to the present moment and to your body, and to join her as she
          gently explores the meaningful metaphors she finds in the sciences of
          ecology, biology, neuroscience, anatomy, and physiology. Clarke
          encourages us to live into these metaphors to question the cultural
          assumptions that lead to so much inequity, pain, horror, and
          suffering. She guides readers into gentle, meditative practices that
          can open us to embodied experiences of grounded calm, and sometimes
          even joy and love—and the awe of being alive.”<br />—Barbara A. Brehm,
          health coach and professor of health sciences at Smith College<br /><br />“In
          <i>Returning Home to Our Bodies,</i> Abigail bravely integrates, not
          alternates, between spirituality and science in this breathtaking
          work. Abigail blurs the lines between science and magic in a way that
          values both data and the divine. This incredible work of integration
          has made the study of somatics feel so whole and so close to my heart
          and mind in a way that no other work ever has. To quote Abigail,
          ‘there really is no distance between us and this wisdom,’ and now
          there’s no distance between you and returning home.”<br />—Colin
          Bedell, astrologer, author, and creator of <i>Queer Cosmos</i
          ><br /><br />“I am thrilled to endorse Abigail Rose Clarke’s
          remarkable book that explores the mysterious and rich area of
          somatics. This book has left a powerful mark on me and my relation to
          the universe.<br /><br />What truly sets Clarke’s book apart is her
          creativeness in connecting somatics to scientific concepts, igniting
          the reader’s imagination and opening doors to new possibilities. As a
          scientist, I appreciate her adeptness at bridging seemingly disparate
          worlds, weaving a tapestry where&nbsp;scientific understanding
          harmonizes with somatic wisdom. One powerful example was how she
          guided a meditation using the anatomy of the connection between the
          heart, breath, and pericardium in a way that my heart can optimally
          relax. Many of the meditations of the senses she eloquently shares in
          this book really resonated with me also.<br /><br />As a scientist
          specializing in quantum physics and pioneer of a somatic movement
          modality utilizing therapeutic tremoring called Shaking Medicine, I am
          keenly aware of the difficulty in balancing scientific and spiritual
          principles. Clarke does this so poetically while maintaining
          scientific accuracy. Her book educated and inspired me on the
          interconnectedness of my being as a whole within my environment.<br /><br />Abigail
          Rose Clarke’s book is an invaluable resource for anyone seeking to
          explore somatics. Whether you are new to somatics or well versed in
          the field, her words will inspire and guide you on a transformative
          journey of self-discovery. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to
          anyone seeking to expand their consciousness, deepen in connection,
          and embark on a profound somatic exploration.”<br />—Dr. Keith Motes,
          quantum physicist and founder of the Shaking Medicine Foundation<br /><br />“If
          you find yourself picking up a book called <i>Returning Home,</i> it
          is perhaps because you might be feeling lost or unmoored. In a world
          of self-help books and media, Abigail Rose Clarke throws weary
          travelers a solid buoy to hold onto in a vast ocean of commodified
          wellness tactics. In doing so, she invites us to be held by the
          incredible healing and love that already exists all around us. By
          witnessing the miracle of our body, the breath in our lungs, the
          ongoing life cycle of all things, Abigail beautifully compiles a list
          of ancient healing practices we have known, and perhaps lost, but can
          come back to. When you feel like you can’t turn anywhere else, you can
          return to your body, you can return to the world around you, and you
          can return home.”<br />—Uzma Chowdhury, writer, teacher, and
          sociologist

        </h4>
        <p>
          Abigail Rose Clarke is somatic facilitator who was born in and
          currently lives in Newton, MA. Clarke helps people return to a
          comfortable relationship with their bodies. She teaches that people
          can use the inherent wisdom of their bodies to be in direct
          conversation with creativity and aliveness as a way to dismantle
          oppressive systems and build generative and deeply relational futures.
          She utilizes&nbsp; somatics and mindfulness. Clarke works with people
          ranging from CEOs and Board Directors to schoolteachers and parents.
          She holds a weekly somatic learning space called Anchor Continuum.
          Clarke is the creator of The Somatic Tarot, a method of engaging with
          the archetype Tarot in ways that are rooted in liberatory practices,
          as a guide to a healing future. Her work is enormously influenced by
          her study and practice of Embodyoga®, of which she is a senior
          teacher, as well as her background in kinesiology and psychology.
