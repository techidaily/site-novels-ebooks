          <p>
            Before the dawn of history mankind was engaged in the study of
            dreaming. The wise man among the ancients was preeminently the
            interpreter of dreams. The ability to interpret successfully or
            plausibly was the quickest road to royal favor, as Joseph and Daniel
            found it to be; failure to give satisfaction in this respect led to
            banishment from court or death. When a scholar laboriously
            translates a cuneiform tablet dug up from a Babylonian mound where
            it has lain buried for five thousand years or more, the chances are
            that it will turn out either an astrological treatise or a dream
            book. If the former, we look upon it with some indulgence; if the
            latter with pure contempt. For we know that the study of the stars,
            though undertaken for selfish reasons and pursued in the spirit of
            charlatanry, led at length to physical science, while the study of
            dreams has proved as unprofitable as the dreaming of them. Out of
            astrology grew astronomy. Out of oneiromancy has grown - nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            That at least was substantially true up to the beginning of the
            present century. Dream books in all languages continued to sell in
            cheap editions and the interpreters of dreams made a decent or, at
            any rate, a comfortable living out of the poorer classes. But the
            psychologist rarely paid attention to dreams except incidentally in
            his study of imagery, association and the speed of thought. But now
            a change has come over the spirit of the times. The subject of the
            significance of dreams, so long ignored, has suddenly become a
            matter of energetic study and of fiery controversy the world over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cause of this revival of interest is the new point of view
            brought forward by Professor Bergson in the paper which is here made
            accessible to the English-reading public. This is the idea that we
            can explore the unconscious substratum of our mentality, the
            storehouse of our memories, by means of dreams, for these memories
            are by no means inert, but have, as it were, a life and purpose of
            their own, and strive to rise into consciousness whenever they get a
            chance, even into the semi-consciousness of a dream. To use
            Professor Bergson's striking metaphor, our memories are packed away
            under pressure like steam in a boiler and the dream is their escape
            valve.
          </p>
          <p>
            That this is more than a mere metaphor has been proved by Professor
            Freud and others of the Vienna school, who cure cases of hysteria by
            inducing the patient to give expression to the secret anxieties and
            emotions which, unknown to him, have been preying upon his mind. The
            clue to these disturbing thoughts is generally obtained in dreams or
            similar states of relaxed consciousness. According to the Freudians
            a dream always means something, but never what it appears to mean.
            It is symbolic and expresses desires or fears which we refuse
            ordinarily to admit to consciousness, either because they are
            painful or because they are repugnant to our moral nature. A
            watchman is stationed at the gate of consciousness to keep them
            back, but sometimes these unwelcome intruders slip past him in
            disguise.
