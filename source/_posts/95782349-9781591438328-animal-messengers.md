          An animal-by-animal guide that reveals the meaning behind each
          encounter we have with animals <br />
          <br />• Provides sophisticated psychological insight into encounters
          with more than 150 animals, birds, reptiles, insects, and aquatic life
          <br />
          <br />• Explores how animals reflect our inner world, drawing our
          attention to inner turmoil, relationship issues, spiritual growth, and
          the deepest needs of the soul <br />
          <br />• Explains how the meaning of each encounter depends on whether
          the animal was hunting, fleeing, hiding, or acting indifferent when
          sighted <br />
          <br />We each feel connections to animals in our own way. Some of us
          have pets. Others admire animals in the wild. Because the outer world
          often reflects our internal states and animals are highly sensitive to
          our energies, each encounter with an animal signals something about
          our inner world and innermost concerns. The spontaneous, surprising
          contacts are the telling ones: a sparrow landing next to you, a fox
          darting across the road, or a bee alighting on your hand. However,
          even regular encounters with our pets can draw attention to our inner
          world and what needs to be thought over and grappled with, from
          psychic turmoil and relationship issues to spiritual growth and the
          deepest needs of the soul. <br />
          <br />Providing sophisticated psychological insight into encounters
          with more than 150 animals, birds, reptiles, insects, and aquatic
          life, Regula Meyer explores the messages each animal provides for us
          on a personal level when we encounter them. She explains how the
          meaning of each encounter depends on whether the animal was hunting,
          fleeing, hiding, or acting indifferent when sighted. For example, a
          fleeing animal is prompting you to pursue a subject consciously, while
          a hiding animal tells you to patiently observe something and draw
          insights from it. <br />
          <br />The author shows how animal encounters in the wild cause us to
          contemplate the present moment and inspire the flow of our
          perceptions, leading us to meditate on important concerns we may be
          ignoring or unaware of. Pets and other animals we see every day act as
          intensifiers of the energy for which they stand. <br />
          <br />With this animal-by-animal guide, you can discover the deep
          meaning behind your encounters with animals and the messages they
          bring as oracles of our souls.
