            >“Takes a fresh approach to becoming masterful at using ‘no’ to say
            ‘yes’ to life.” —Cheryl Richardson, author of
            <i>The&nbsp;Art of&nbsp;Extreme&nbsp;Self-Care</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          “No” is sometimes the hardest word to say. It’s also the most
          necessary.<br /><br />
          How many times have you heard yourself saying yes to the wrong
          things—overwhelming requests, bad relationships, time-consuming
          obligations? How often have you wished you could summon the power to
          turn them down?<br /><br />
          Drawing on their own stories, as well as feedback from their readers
          and students, authors James Altucher and Claudia Azula Altucher
          clearly show that you have the right to say no:<br /><br />
          • To anything that is hurting you.<br />
          •&nbsp;To standards that no longer serve you.<br />
          •&nbsp;To people who drain you of your creativity and expression.<br />
          •&nbsp;To beliefs that are not true to the real you.<br /><br />
          It’s one thing to say “No,” the authors explain. It’s another thing to
          have the Power of No. When you do, you will have a stronger sense of
          what is good for you and the people around you, and you will have a
          deeper understanding of who you are. Ultimately, you’ll be freed to
          say a truly powerful “Yes” in your life—one that opens the door to
          opportunities, abundance, and love.

          “Every ‘no’ makes space for the perfect ‘yes.’ It’s impossible to
          thrive in an overcommitted world. And yet it’s so easy to get caught
          up—to drain our energy bank account, leaving us mentally, physically,
          and spiritually bankrupt. Your freedom may be closer than you
          think.&nbsp;The Power of No&nbsp;by James and Claudia Altucher is an
          invitation to a universe of meaningful opportunities on the other side
          of ‘no.’ I’m so grateful for this book and I know you will be
          too.”&nbsp;<br /><b

          ><br /><i> </i><br />“<i>The Power of No</i> takes a fresh approach to
          becoming masterful at using ‘no’ to say ‘yes’ to life. Grounded in
          both practical and spiritual wisdom, James and Claudia take the reader
          on an unexpected journey that explores a variety of ways we prevent
          ourselves from being fully present in the here and now. Their book is
          filled with magic that can change your life if you’re brave enough to
          follow their lead!”<br /><b

          human species. It’s bold, empowering, and useful. It gave me the
          courage to turn down distractions so that I could focus on the
          important things in life, like endorsing this book.”<br /><b

          “What I like about James is you can tell he came from a roller
          coaster. He chose his own path to success without knowing the outcome.
          And... one thing is for sure: if you don’t make courageous choices for
          yourself, nobody else will.”<br />
