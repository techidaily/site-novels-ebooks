          <p>Is there life after death? Is there a world outside our own?</p>
          <p>
            Mankind has wrestled with these profound questions for as long as
            there has been consciouness.
            <i>Gateways to the Otherworld</i> reveals that ancient man already
            knew the answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acclaimed author Philip Gardiner proves that our ancestors were far
            more advanced—scientifically and spiritually—than previously
            believed. Through a special technique, ancient Egyptians and others
            were able to journey to other realities within themselves—in short,
            to the Otherworld. The author undergoes his own experiments to prove
            the point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gardiner makes us consider the fact that ancient man also knew more
            about his place in the universe than previously thought. He placed
            buildings and objects in specific places around the globe. Why?
            Because at these points he had discovered areas where lines of
            energy cross—points with distinct relation to the universal and
            human wave resonance of electromagnetism. When man journeyed to
            these places, he was joining with God and visualising the effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remarkable conclusions and discoveries in this book not only
            dispel some age-old myths, but also address questions such as:<br />Is
            there a universal frequency that allows the mind to travel into
            other realms?How does this relate to the holographic universe and
            the concept of quantum entanglement?Does the Great Pyramid hold a
            real secret to the quantum realm?What are those mysterious round
            towers found scattered around our planet?Is there an answer to the
            phenomena of earth energies?What is the truth behind the Crystal
            Skulls and the rods of power?Is ESP real?
          </p>
          <p>
            What <i>Gateways to the Otherworld</i> uncovers are not just tales
            of ancient trips to other realms, nor theories on why stone circles
            were built in specific locations, but real answers based on thorough
            research and science.
