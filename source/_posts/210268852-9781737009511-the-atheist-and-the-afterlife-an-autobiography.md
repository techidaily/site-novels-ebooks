              As each paranormal event unfolds, you will be able to follow them

              Although the subject matter may be quite serious and a little
              gritty at times, it is the author's wish that, those who can
              relate to having similar types of traumatic experiences, learn

              your future goals and ultimately finding love and peace.</span

          "Author Ray Catania shares his journey of "inspiration, transformation
          and the pursuit of enlightenment" in the nonfictional work, The
          Atheist and the Afterlife-An Autobiography. He tells his story with
          honesty, with a gritty sense, but always based on Truth. He shares how
          his childhood developed into an atheistic belief system. However,
          through some amazing occurrences in his life, he learned to trust the
          visions and messages he received, transforming this belief system.
          Over time, he embraced the practice of meditation, leading him to
          embrace the gift of becoming a clairvoyant medium. This transformation
          is told through his sharing of personal stories, illustrating the
          evolution of his abilities." - Deborah Lloyd for Readers' Favorite

          "I liked how Ray was articulate in describing the events that led to
          his change in beliefs to the universal collective consciousness
          structure. He was open and vulnerable-and vulnerability, in my
          opinion, is an authentic trigger for inspiration-in how he talked
          about the events he experienced, his moments of self-doubt, and
          eventually how he got to accept the reality of the laws of the
          universe." - Jachike Samuelson for The Online Book Club

          "Catania's text is distinctive in many ways - notably, its focus on
          the evolution of one individual's spiritual and metaphysical
          beliefs.&nbsp;The author&nbsp;offers multiple straightforward steps
          for readers to implement, despite a fairly enigmatic topic. His
          recommendations are articulate and represent a strength for this
          text." - The Book Life Prize Editor

          "This book shows the reality of awakening, which is not always smooth
          and pleasant, and can be full of doubt and disbelief.&nbsp;Ray walks
          us through his psyche as he navigates this opening of consciousness
          (or 'awareness') and offers details of this raw experience plus the
          scientific angle.&nbsp;And his theory of dark energy will certainly
          make you think." - Tania Berg - Host of Life Continuing Podcast
