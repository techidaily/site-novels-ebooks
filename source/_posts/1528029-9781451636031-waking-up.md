            >For the millions of Americans who want spirituality without
            religion, Sam Harris’s latest <i>New York Times </i>bestseller is a
            guide to meditation as a rational practice informed by neuroscience
            and psychology.</b
          ><br /><br />From Sam Harris, neuroscientist and author of numerous
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling books, <i>Waking Up</i> is for the
          twenty percent of Americans who follow no religion but who suspect
          that important truths can be found in the experiences of such figures
          as Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, Rumi, and the other saints and sages of
          history. Throughout this book, Harris argues that there is more to
          understanding reality than science and secular culture generally
          allow, and that how we pay attention to the present moment largely
          determines the quality of our lives.<br />
          <br /><i>Waking Up</i> is part memoir and part exploration of the
          scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries
          contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author
          other than Sam Harris—a scientist, philosopher, and famous
          skeptic—could write it.

          Praise for The Moral Landscape: <br />
          <br />
          “The most compelling strand in <i>The Moral Landscape</i> is its
          unspooling diatribe against relativism.” —New York Times <br />
          <br />
          “This is an inspiring book, holding out as it does the possibility of
          a rational understanding of how to construct the good life with the
          aid of science, free from the accretions of religious superstition and
          cultural coercion.” —Financial Times <br />
          <br />
          “Harris’s is a first-principle argument, backed by copious empirical
          evidence woven through a tightly reasoned narrative… Harris’s program
          of a science-based morality is a courageous one that I wholeheartedly
          endorse.” —Scientific American <br />
          <br />
          “Sam Harris breathes intellectual fire into an ancient debate. Reading
          this thrilling, audacious book, you feel the ground shifting beneath
          your feet. Reason has never had a more passionate advocate.”—Ian
          McEwan <br />
          <br />
          “I was one of those who had unthinkingly bought into the hectoring
          myth that science can say nothing about morals. To my surprise,
          <i>The Moral Landscape</i> has changed all that for me. It should
          change it for philosophers too. Philosophers of mind have already
          discovered that they can't duck the study of neuroscience, and the
          best of them have raised their game as a result. Sam Harris shows that
          the same should be true of moral philosophers, and it will turn their
          world exhilaratingly upside down. As for religion, and the
          preposterous idea that we need God to be good, nobody wields a sharper
          bayonet than Sam Harris.”—Richard Dawkins <br />
          <br />
          “Reading Sam Harris is like drinking water from a cool stream on a hot
          day. He has the rare ability to frame arguments that are not only
          stimulating, they are downright nourishing… His discussions will
          provoke secular liberals and religious conservatives alike, who
          jointly argue from different perspectives that there always will be an
          unbridgeable chasm between merely knowing what is and discerning what
          should be. As was the case with Harris’ previous books, readers are
          bound to come away with previously firm convictions about the world
          challenged, and a vital new awareness about the nature and value of
          science and reason in our lives.” —Lawrence M. Krauss, Foundation
          Professor and Director of the ASU Origins Project at Arizona State
          University, author of The Physics of Star Trek, and, Quantum Man:
          Richard Feynman’s Life in Science <br />
          <br />
          “A lively, provocative, and timely new look at one of the deepest
          problems in the world of ideas. Harris makes a powerful case for a
          morality that is based on human flourishing and thoroughly enmeshed
          with science and rationality. It is a tremendously appealing vision,
          and one that no thinking person can afford to ignore.” —Steven Pinker,
          Harvard College Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and
          author of How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate
