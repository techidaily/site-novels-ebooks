          “The strongest people in the world are women. It’s our superpower. But
          we’ve been programmed to see ourselves as anything but. In
          <i>The Woman’s Book of Strength</i>, Sue Patton Thoele doles out
          gentle daily doses of the medicine we need to meet ourselves, find
          ourselves, love ourselves, and encourage ourselves to grow into our
          innate feminine fullness. This is a superb deep soul writing and
          journaling companion.”<br />
          —Janet Conner, author of <i>Writing Down Your Soul</i>,
          <i>Soul Vows</i>, <i>Find Your Soul’s Purpose</i> and many more
          <br /><br />
          “<i>The Woman’s Book of Strength</i> is like having a close friend and
          capable therapist at the ready, any time of day! This book is
          chock-full of thought-provoking quotes, meditations, helpful
          questions, encouragements, and simple practices to help readers access
          more courage, compassion, connection, and comfort. Think of any topic
          that supports us, stumps us, or brings us sorrow, and Sue Patton
          Thoele has addressed it in this wise and wonderful tome. Woven in
          throughout this book are her light-hearted, yet vulnerable, personal
          anecdotes that hold us in the warmth of ‘you are not alone.’ Want to
          feel more empowered and uplifted? This book is for you. Need cheering
          along the way? Sue Thoele is there for you!”<br />
          —Sherry Richert Belul, founder of Simply Celebrate and author of
          <i>Say It Now</i><br /><br />
          “This work IS the voice of a good friend reminding you of your deepest
          strength, your great capacity, and giving you the grace and permission
          to be present to the world as your truest self, without apology. Sue
          Thoele’s lifetime commitment to women speaking up for themselves is an
          invitation to authenticity, living with intention and without regret.
          In this book, she becomes your advocate for living a magnificent,
          strong, rewarding life. Let her inspire you!”<br />
          —Mary Anne Radmacher, author of<br />
          COURAGE DOESN’T ALWAYS ROAR <br /><br />
          “In her lovely new book of meditations, Sue Patton Thoele urges women
          to ‘use our gentle yet forceful power.’ Heartbroken by the continuing
          rash of school shootings, Thoele gathers energy for a well of deep
          emotion, crafting a book for all ages. In beautifully written essays,
          each followed by action steps, her insights and suggestions guide
          readers to wake up to their inherent strength, wisdom, and compassion.
          Thoele aims to help ‘women courageously claim and act from their
          inherent strength and gentle power.’ The gorgeous result meets and
          exceeds her important goal.”<br />
          —Nita Sweeney, award-winning author of
          <i>Depression Hate a Moving Target</i><br /><br />
          “Women of all ages will benefit from
          <i>The Woman’s Book of Strength</i>. Its powerful message of women’s
          inherent strength, wisdom, and grace is encouraging and exciting. Each
          inspiring meditation is an affirmation, a comforting guide reminding
          us to participate fully, to embrace our brave heart and daring spirit,
          and to share our gifts with others.”<br />
          —Judy Ford, LICSW, author of <i>Wonderful Ways to Love a Child</i
          ><br /><br />
          “Sue Thoele’s book was just what I needed at this time. I found myself
          taking copious notes about her musings to utilize in my own life. The
          book is kind, gentle, and authentically from her heart. Among her many
          suggestions was HUG: Honor where you are, Utilize help that’s
          available, and be Gentle with yourself. What can be simpler yet more
          to the point? And her reference to her ‘holies’ touched me deeply. We
          do all have them and to honor them, as she does, serves as a wonderful
          reminder to every reader to take notice. This book will change you and
          strengthen your hope in yourself and the world we inhabit.”<br />
          —Karen Casey, author of <i>Each Day a New Beginning</i><br /><br />
          “Sue Patton Thoele captured my attention and my heart on the very
          first page of her book
          <i
            >The Woman’s Book of Strength: Meditations for Wisdom, Balance &amp;
            Power</i
          >
          when she wrote ‘When we are connected to our essence, women can create
          magic.’ I believe it, and I also know that our essence often becomes
          clouded by fear, self-doubt, and other obstacles that separate us from
          ourselves. Patton Thoele’s book is the antidote to that kind of
          separation. Thanks to Patton Thoele’s gentle wisdom, guidance, and
          meditations —which are found throughout
          <i>The Woman's Book of Strength</i> —we can find our way back to our
          essence, our strength, and to ourselves to live in that space of
          authenticity where our hearts and our heads are integrated.
          <i>The Woman's Book of Strength</i> is a wise, powerful, encouraging
          book and with her writing, Patton Thoele reminds us we are too.”<br />
