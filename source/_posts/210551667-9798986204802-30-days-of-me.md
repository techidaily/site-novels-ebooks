          <p>
            Since we were children, most of us were taught to depend on other
            people and things for our own happiness, joy, and fulfillment. We
            relied heavily on acceptance and validation from our parents,
            caregivers, family members, and friends. Unfortunately, some of us
            still do today.
          </p>
          <p>
            In adulthood, often times our learned co-dependent behaviors
            manifest imposter syndrome - fueling us with the empty idea that
            someone or something is needed to make us complete and whole. We
            relinquish our power thinking and acting as if we're not good enough
            alone. Then we attempt to fill the void with relationships, jobs,
            and material matters blindly in hopes that someone or something will
            make us feel good, useful, and stay forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's an epic fail every time. Even when all the red flags are
            visually clear as day, we struggle with cutting the cord and letting
            go. Eventually, we are forced to loosen the grip leaving us feeling
            defeated and depleted.
