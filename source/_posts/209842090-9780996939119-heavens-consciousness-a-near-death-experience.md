            Born in the hills of Arizona, Rhonda Nell Dooley grew up in Tulsa,
            Oklahoma. Today, Rhonda is a Life Spiritual Coach. In her twenties,
            she worked five years as a full-time missionary caring for orphans
            and the homeless. Thirty years ago, Rhonda spent forty minutes in
            Heaven.
          </p>
          <p>
            She shared these experiences with her closest friends through poetry
            and painting. They finally convinced her to express her Heavenly
            insights in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            While these experiences are often difficult to articulate, Rhonda
            has done an outstanding job of capturing and explaining them. And
            her readers will benefit from the reflections, poetry, and the
            scriptures that provide a deeper, inner knowing of God.
