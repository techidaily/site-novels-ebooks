            >Harness the power of lunar magic with 13 essential practices for
            the modern witch—one for each New Moon of the year<br /><br />Fresh,
            fierce, and unapologetically feminist, this&nbsp;is both guidebook
            and rallying cry: an intersectional and inclusive magical praxis
            that resists, disrupts, and opens the door to nourishment,
            abundance, and transformation—for readers of
            <i>Psychic Witch</i> and <i>The Spell Book for New Witches</i></b
          ><br /><br />In <b><i>New Moon Magic</i></b
          >, <b><i>Missing Witches</i></b> authors Risa Dickens and Amy Torok
          offer Witchy practices to change your life and reshape the world,
          without falling prey to the commercialization that belies the true
          heart—and power—of magic.<br /><br />Witchcraft is praxis: how we do
          what we believe, and how we make those beliefs manifest.
          <b><i>New Moon Magic</i></b> is an offering to all witches, honoring
          the Craft’s roots in centuries of empowerment, survival, and
          resistance—despite capitalism’s attempts to co-opt and dilute its
          practice.<br /><br />Here, Dickens and Torok reclaim tools of
          witchcraft as the ways and means of enchantment, imbued with magic
          that resists commodification and capitalism. The authors introduce 13
          New Moon practices, each paired with a Witch who embodies the
          Craft:<br />Potions with Cerridwen and&nbsp;St. Hildegard von
          BingenDivination with Lozen and Harriet TubmanThe Garden with Mayumi
          OdaRitual &amp; Ceremony with Genesis&nbsp;P-OrridgeThe Circle with
          Audre Lorde&nbsp;Through historical research, interviews, and the
          authors’ own raw personal stories, <b><i>New Moon Magic</i></b> offers
          wisdom and guidance from real Witches past and present. It shows you
          how to take up tools and practices, discover (or rediscover) your own
          magic, and nurture a Witchcraft that creates instead of consumes.

          "With their first book, Amy and Risa invited us all on a journey of
          story and magic that followed the rhythm of the Sun. Now we are
          invited to make another journey; to see ourselves, others, and our
          tools through the ever-changing and potent phases of the Moon. Come
          join us, join Risa and Amy, and let us all make magic together!"<br />—Jinkx
          Monsoon, Queen of All Queens<br /><br />"Missing Witches weave
          together magical history, the potent present, and futurism to offer us
          inspiration and resources. This is a beautiful guide to healing that
          emphasizes that healing comes in many forms and that reminds us that
          we are not alone."<br />—Sarah Faith Gottessdiener, creator of
          <i>Moonbeaming</i>, the <i>Many Moons</i> workbooks, and author of
          <i>The Moon Book</i><br /><br />"This book is more than a book. It is
          an ecosystem teeming with modern Witches, ancestral agitators,
          anarchic seeds, and embodied practices. This book channels the moon’s
          medicine of mutability and movement. There is a medicine available for
          every type of weather and every type of body."<br />—Sophie Strand,
          author of <i>The Flowering Wand</i> and <i>The Madonna Secret</i
          ><br /><br />"Imagine, for a moment, entering a portal where you are
          encircled and empowered with the words, the magic, and the wisdom of
          historical and modern Witches. By holding this book in your hands, you
          hold the key. Open the portal of the pages of <i>New Moon Magic</i> to
          embrace ritual, to unlock the stories of spellcasting, to rejoice in
          rising up together to create change. Amy and Risa’s book contains the
          juicy secrets and stories of personal Witchcraft to cultivate your own
          practice in a way that is authentic to you. In <i>New Moon Magic</i>,
          you are the spell!<br />—Veronica Varlow, author of
          <i>Bohemian Magick</i><br /><br />"This book is a welcome reminder
          that we need neither products nor permissions to make meaning, to
          build community, to exercise our power to shape our spiritual and
          physical lives. From celebrating our connection with nature to
          reaffirming our fundamental right to occupy space in the world,
          <i>New Moon Magic</i> is a timely message of empowerment and
          resistance."<br />—Jarod K. Anderson, creator of
          <i>The Cryptonaturalist </i>and author of
          <i>Field Guide to the Haunted Forest</i> and
          <i>Love Notes from the Hollow Tree</i><br /><br />"We are at a point
          in history where, once again, resistance is necessary. Laws, science,
          nature, policy, equity, inclusion, and freedom are being challenged
          more than ever. It can be easy to get wrapped up in the veil of
          “purchasing power,” wanting or needing to buy the “right” tool for
          your magical tradition. <i>New Moon Magic</i> helps you understand why
          this isn’t so, how this belief only soils the freedoms we all should
          enjoy, and how to get results while respecting the traditions of
          fellow healers, artists, and writers, from all different cultures and
          experiences. Risa and Amy give you an introduction with tools,
          stories, and substantial reference points on and for each tool, by
          those who are in and not in our community of healers. There is
          something for you in here. Whether you enjoy ritual, nature, geometry,
          poems, chants, or just want to learn more, you can find what you are
          looking for or store away the information in a book of shadows or vlog
          for later. The authors’ truth comes honestly as they tell you about
          their own lives in ritual and supported by ritual. This helps you to
          see for yourself the true life of a practitioner—in times of mourning,
          joy, doubt, hope, and need.<br /><br />This book is a call to action
          for those who want to be change agents without increasing the chasm
          between the social and political. I say this as a coven member, a
          Patreon contributor, a guest on the <i>Missing Witches</i> podcast,
          and a fan of their first book. As a practitioner of my own beliefs, I
          can attest to this book’s wisdom and that it can be used by and shared
          with any magical tradition. The guidance is gentle—like a friend
          pulling you aside to share a great secret—but comes with backbone and
          research behind it. Research that is shared and bared from activists,
          authors, educators, practitioners, and healers from many other walks
          of life in addition to Witches. The tools themselves are as vast as
          the stories that are interwoven in the journey through the text.
          Bodies, tarot, art, needles, knives, geometry, journaling, poetry,
          brooms, crayons, and so on. Even though I do not practice in the same
          way as Risa and Amy, I can use these thirteen tools in a way that is
          familiar to me, respectful of my needs and ways, without diluting the
          message. I can’t wait for you to experience this book for yourself and
          to learn and grow in your practice and join the cause of resistance to
          capitalism."<br />—Sherry Shone, author of
          <i>The Hoodoo Guide to the Bible</i> and
          <i>Hoodoo for Everyone<br /><br /></i>

        <p>
          Dickens and Torok are authors of <i>Missing Witches</i> and hosts of
          the <i>Missing Witches</i> podcast.&nbsp;In books, conversations, and
          magic circles, they continually ask what stories and ideas have been
          erased by the whitewashing, commodification, and global persecution of
          Witches and other magical practitioners and seek ways to practice
          without perpetuating colonial violence.
