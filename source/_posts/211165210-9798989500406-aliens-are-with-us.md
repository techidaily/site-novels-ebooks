              >After more than fifty years of keeping his experiences a secret
              for fear of ridicule and repercussions now that Bill Rountree has
              retired early from his successful career as a computer software
              manager he is ready to share his true story of the enigmatic
              visits he first began receiving when he was only eight years old.
              For the first few years he was only observed by a mysterious
              otherworldly device but then a voice spoke to him on two
              occasions, revealing that they were intelligent life forms from
              another planet, as well as telling him some other clues as to why
              they are here. These and other types of visits continued to occur
              several times a year for more than fifty years.</span

              >"Aliens Are With Us" is unlike many other books in this genre. It
              is not a tragic and terrifying story of aliens or alien abduction
              but weaves all of Bill's experiences together to arrive at a more
              favorable conclusion regarding alien involvement on earth.</span

              >The book is broken into two sections, the first being "What I
              Know" in which Bill tells about the visits from aliens which he
              knows beyond a doubt to be factual, followed by "What I Believe"
              in which he tells of other significant experiences which are more
              open to interpretation. He also shares alien experiences from
              other very credible sources, as well as some fascinating
              scientific information corroborating the possibility of other
              intelligent life in the universe, near death experiences, and
              reincarnation. The book concludes with several chapters on what he
              believes it all means based on his many experiences, including how
              it all relates to the afterlife, reincarnation, and our guardian
              angels.</span
