            Film Auteur and Chief Creative Officer, Kevin Morosky, invites the
            women he considers his most trusted advisors, closest friends, and
            biggest inspirations to explore how their impact shapes culture and
            nourishes society. Through a series of conversations which consider
            the themes of resilience, patience, autonomy, focus, identity,
            communication, Kevin shares how their collective teachings and
            support has helped shape his own life and creative path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing upon his own experiences in the creative industry across
            advertising, photography, film and art, Kevin invites you to find
            your own identity, empowering you to bring 100% of yourself into the
            room – not just the 30% that’s deemed ‘palatable’ by those already
            in it. Centring the Black women who always support him, Kevin and
            his friends, family and mentors reflect on what it takes to
            authentically achieve your creative freedom. This book is about
            really admiring and revelling in the magic Black women always bring
            to the table, a magic that benefits us all.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is both Kevin’s love letter to Black women, and a revolt
            against tired, status-quo thinking around creativity and
            advertising.

          “The whole book feels like a giant hug, a hug I've not had in a long,
          long time. I’ve spent a lot of time crying over these beautiful
          thought-provoking essays. They are so poignant, so tender, so
          beautiful it feels like, well how I wish black women were treated.”
