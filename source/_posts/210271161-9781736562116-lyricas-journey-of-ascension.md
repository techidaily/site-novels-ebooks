            There are many stories living within this book of supreme
            revelations.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, it is the story of a brave and determined soul, Lyrica, who
            chose to arrive into our world with no voice and who, with the love
            and support of her mom and her mentor, was able to actualize her
            purpose and create a life of supreme value for herself and others,
            demonstrating that no one is limited.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, it is the epic saga of the nonverbal autistics, why they are
            here in the form that they are, and what they bring to us,
            demonstrating a level of love for humanity that is truly staggering
            to behold and be held in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, it is the revelation of where humanity's process of awakening
            is headed, the amazing new worlds and abilities that open up when
            our nonphysical and physical selves unify and we achieve a state of
            Oneness with the All the Is.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, it is a demystified experiential account of the hero's
            journey that, when consciously chosen, becomes the path of
            Ascension, where we strip away all that is not our true essence and,
            in the process, become empowered to create the life that we have
            always dreamed of and so much more that we have yet to imagine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lyrica's Journey of Ascension is a Nautilus Book Award Winner and an
            International Book Awards Finalist and has been translated into
            Spanish. Lyrica's story is featured in two episodes of Season 3 of
            Extra Dimensionals on Gaia TV.

          Lyrica Marquez was a key inspiration behind my novel,&nbsp;The
          Unsuspected Heroes, a story sharing the magic and mystery of
          nonspeaking autistics.&nbsp;Lyrica's Journey of Ascension&nbsp;shares
          the "lost years" after Gayle and Lyrica stopped working with other
          autistics and set out on living their purpose. This book reveals the
          journey of a brave nonverbal autistic and her mother on a journey of
          self-realization. It is the story of seeking the unification of the
          higher self and physical form, the path many today seek during this
          time of humanity's ascension.&nbsp;Lyrica's Journey of
          Ascension&nbsp;is&nbsp;bold, original, and definitely out of this
          world.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Lyrica's Journey of Ascension is a wonderful invitation to see Non
          Verbal Autistics beyond the typical lens of challenge and
          "disability." This is a deep dive into the greater truth of and
          contribution that these divine souls make as they fully embody. To say
          that it takes dedication to undertake full embodiment is an
          understatement; however, Lyrica has broken the mold and thus created
          the opportunity for other positive high frequency beings to do the
          same. I highly recommend reading this book, both for its insight and
          direction and for the potential that it ignites in anyone who knows
          that embodiment of all that they are is their path. Both Gayle and
          Lyrica's references to the divine mother and being of that
          consciousness is key here! This book is as much an initiation as it is
          a profound story of a courageous journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have witnessed, paralleled, and intersected with Gayle and Lyrica's
          journey over the years and am deeply grateful, both personally and
          professionally, for their journey. I have supported the full
          integration of other high frequency beings for the last two and half
          decades and know first hand the amazing gift that these souls are to
          those around them and to humanity at large.&nbsp;The embodiment of
          these beings here now has untold significance for our future! Please
          read the book and consider the possibilities.

          It is time for personal ascension stories! And the story of Lyrica's
          ascension journey (and Gayle's), gives such wonderful detail about
          this ongoing process: what it looks like, what it feels like, what
          revelations and energetic and consciousness shifts come along with it.
          Lyrica is able to see and know so many subtle elements and dimensions
          of her ascension process, with the amazing scope of her highly
          expanded awareness and her ability to communicate this, though she is
          labeled "non-verbal autistic." Gayle walks along right with her; and
          the ongoing dialogue they have throughout the book, each one writing
          their inner experiences and "telling their story," is incredibly
          valuable and exciting for all of us.
