            >Are you stressed out, anxious, or overwhelmed? Get out of the storm
            swirling in your head—and into the peaceful place inside you.
            <i>Eff This! Meditation</i> will help you let that crap go…with 108
            hands-on practices rooted in humor, love, straight talk, and a deep
            respect for the foundational teachings of Buddhism. If you’re ready
            to throw your hands in the air and yell “Eff This!” you are not
            alone—and this book can help.<br />

          ><br />
          You already know that you <i>should</i> meditate, and that meditation
          will make you happier and healthier. But you’re tired and irritated,
          and every time you try to meditate, your mind races and you can't stop
          thinking about that jerk at work. If this describes you, then this
          might be just what you need. This is not a joke, this is
          <b>real meditation—and really effective practices—for everyday life</b
          >. This book is a reference for you to come back to again and again.
          Integrate these tips into your daily life, or pull it off the shelf
          when you need a boost.<br /><br />
          Learn to <b>celebrate the small victories</b> in life with a “to done”
          list. <b>Release yourself from phone addiction</b> with a digital
          detox plan. <b>Get your body out of stress mode</b> by practicing
          diaphragmatic breathing. Be transported, and open your heart with a
          pick-me-up playlist. These are just a few of the simple, practical
          strategies that will help you find your center.<br /><br /><i
            >Eff This! Meditation</i
          >
          is <b>a Shamatha (mindfulness-awareness) practice</b> rooted in
          radical compassion for self, and
          <b>presented in 108 tips, tricks, and ideas</b>. They are all centered
          on the idea that, as humans, we might not be “finished,” but we are
          complete.
          <b
            >Everything you need to attain enlightenment is already contained
            within you</b
          >, and you can use meditation—and these practices—to connect with
          it.<br /><br />
          The book offers 108 exercises,

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Liza Kindred </b>has studied meditation and Buddhism with some of
          the best teachers in the world for over a decade...but she still
          swears a lot. (After all, the path to enlightenment runs right through
          the messy realities of everyday life.)<br /><br />
          Liza is the creator of EFF THIS! Meditation, where she offers
          mindfulness practices to cynics, skeptics, and busy people. She is
          also the founder of Mindful Technology™ where she teaches companies
          how to build tech that values humans more than machines. Liza is a
          licensed minister, a level two reiki practitioner, and a terrible but
          passionate surfer.<br /><br />
          As a meditation teacher and sought-after global keynote speaker, Liza
          has taught and spoken on five continents, from huge events like SxSW
          and Web Summit to intimate gatherings on living room floors. Her
          clients include companies like <i>Vogue</i> magazine, Microsoft,
          Hearst, and FedEx. She has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>,
          <i>Wired</i> magazine, Well+Good, <i>The Telegraph</i>, and
          <i>Entrepreneur</i> magazine.<br /><br />
          If there is one thing that Liza wants you to know, it’s that there is
          nothing wrong with you. While the wellness industrial complex might
          use self care as a way to keep us striving for constant improvement,
          she believes that unconditional self love in the here and now is the
          only way to ever be truly happy. You are complete, just not
          finished.<br /><br />
