          • Three hardcover volumes in slipcase <br /><br />• Corrects the many
          mistranslations, copyist mistakes, and errors introduced from other

          <br /><br />• Presents a nearly complete bibliography of Agrippa’s
          primary sources <br /><br />One of the most important texts in the
          Western magical tradition for nearly 500 years, Heinrich Cornelius
          Agrippa’s 1533 work Three <i>Books of Occult Philosophy</i> collates a
          multitude of sources from the Classical, Medieval, and Renaissance
          periods and organizes them into a coherent explanation of the magical
          world. Divided into three parts--the natural world, the celestial
          world, and the divine world--the book systematically explains the
          philosophy, logic, and methods of magic and astrology and how they
          work. <br /><br />The basis for 19th-century magical orders such as
          the Golden Dawn and a primary source for countless books on magical
          uses of stones, herbs, incense, and astrology, Agrippa’s many lists
          and diagrams have proven invaluable to magicians since the 16th
          century. Yet, until now, all English editions of Agrippa’s
          <i>Three Books</i> were based on the same flawed 1651 translation from
          the mysterious “J.F.” <br /><br />In this new translation from the
          original 1533 Latin edition, Eric Purdue corrects the many
          mistranslations, copyist mistakes, and errors introduced from other
          editions as well as restores all of Agrippa’s original illustrations.
          Purdue notates every correction and offers commentary, drawing on
          major developments in the research of older magical and astrological
          texts. He also presents a nearly complete bibliography of Agrippa’s
          primary sources, revealing Agrippa as a mainstream scholar of his day.
          <br /><br />Presenting the first new English translation of
          <i>Three Books of Occult</i> <i>Philosophy</i> in more than 350 years,
          this three-volume hardcover boxed set repairs the gaps in knowledge
          pervasive in the original translation and restores the magical spirit
          of Agrippa’s masterpiece, allowing us to hear Agrippa speak again.

          “Eric Purdue’s fine new translation of H. C. Agrippa’s
          <i>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</i> is a landmark edition of this
          essential work. Unquestionably the most comprehensive work of the
          European esoteric sciences, this timely new publication of this
          encyclopedic masterwork is accompanied by illustrations restored from
          the original as well as the translator’s erudite notes, sources, and
          references. Agrippa’s works are fundamental to the study of all
          branches and aspects of the tradition, and no esoteric book collection
          should be without this outstanding edition.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          HEINRICH CORNELIUS AGRIPPA von Nettesheim (1486-1535) was a German
          polymath, physician, legal scholar, soldier, theologian, and occult
          writer. Entering the University of Cologne at the age of 13, he
          graduated with a Master of Arts at 16 and went on to study with abbot
          Johannes Trithemius, famous as the teacher of Paracelsus. Acclaimed
          for his lectures on Reuchlin and the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> at
          universities across Europe, Agrippa acted as archivist for the Holy
          Roman Emperor Charles V. Defying accusations of heresy and scrutiny by
          the Inquisition of Cologne, he published the final version of
          <i>Three Books of Occult</i> <i>Philosophy</i> two years before his
          death. Agrippa is considered one of the most influential occultists of
          the early modern period. ERIC PURDUE has studied metaphysics and the
          occult and has practiced magic and astrology for more than thirty
          years, with a particular focus on practical folk and astrological
          magic. Through his lectures and writings on traditional astrology and
          talismanic magic, he has been a notable voice on the subjects of
          medieval astrology, traditional magical systems, and the legacy of
          Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa. His new translation of<i>
            Three Books of Occult Philosophy</i
          >
          was more than 10 years in the making.
