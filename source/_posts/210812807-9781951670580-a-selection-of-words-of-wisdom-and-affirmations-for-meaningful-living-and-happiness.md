          <p>
            This book emanated from interest cultivated by the author's father,
            Mr. Wilfred Wozuzu Acholou, a court clerk and a counselor who taught
            several of the words of wisdom to him and even made him memorize
            them and use them as a guide for life and meaningful living
            especially those with religious connections. He called himself a
            psalmist of the first order and read the book of psalms regularly
            till death. Professor Acholonu wrote this book for his people of
            Awaka, Imo State, Nigeria as a whole, America, and all mankind. He
            wrote it remembering the words of Confucius: "Has God given you
            knowledge? Give it to others for their betterment; Give it to others
            for your improvement."
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;This book is a selection of words of wisdom and affirmations
            for meaningful living and happiness. It is a selection of quotations
            filled with a myriad of clever and pungent sayings to give
            inducement and zeal to conversation, speeches, and writings. It is a
            selection of proverbs, platitudes, affirmations, and wise sayings
            the author got from elderly and learned people and which he also
            copied from different books and publications. He spent many years of
            his life gathering the many entries in this thoughtful book. These
            words of wisdom and affirmations are organized for quick reference
            in alphabetical order. Some of the quotations are satirical,
            sarcastic, cynical, absurd, frivolous, and exaggerated. Some are
            pensive, and reflective, while some are for comfort, meaningful
            living, and happiness. The book is highly useful for speakers,
            writers, editors, teachers, and preachers. It contains words of
            faith and encouragement, lively ideas, common sense, profound
            wisdom, and plain good humor for authors of different kinds.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is written in a style easy to follow. The author is an
            academician and a scientist and yet mustered enough courage to write
            this needful book, non-fictional and not related to science but
            philosophical. He said that he did it as an extra-curricular
            activity and gives credit to his father for the impetus to write it.
            It is a gem to people from all walks of life. It is strongly
            recommended especially to teachers, preachers, speakers, and those
            who want to wax in wisdom and enjoy meaningful living and happiness.
            It really belongs to the library of everyone.&nbsp;
