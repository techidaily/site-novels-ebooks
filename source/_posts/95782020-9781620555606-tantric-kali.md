          The mythology, rituals, meditations, and practices used in Tantric
          worship of the goddess Kali in the tradition of Kashmiri Shaivism
          <br />
          <br />• Reveals the practices of <i>Vamachara</i>, known as the
          Left-hand Path but more accurately translated as the Path of Shakti
          <br />
          <br />• Includes a Kali ritual from the Nirrutara Tantra, translated
          here for the first time <br />
          <br />• Presents devotional chants, meditations, and mudras specific
          to Tantric worship of Kali <br />
          <br />According to traditions going back to pre-Vedic times, Kali
          sprang from the third eye of the Goddess Durga as a destructive and
          terrifying manifestation of feminine power sent to lay waste to the
          forces of evil. Throughout India to this day, Kali is worshipped as
          the destroyer of bondage, capable of liberating her devotee from all
          rules and subjugation. <br />
          <br />In <i>Tantric Kali</i>, Daniel Odier presents the mythology,
          practices, and rituals of Kali worship in the Tantric Kaula tradition
          within Kashmiri Shaivism. He reveals the practices of
          <i>Vamachara</i>, commonly known as the Left-hand Path but more
          accurately translated as the Path of Shakti. In this tradition the
          body itself is Kali’s temple, and it is therefore unnecessary to
          reject or deny the body to know union with the divine. Instead,
          nothing is regarded as pure or impure and there is complete freedom
          from rules. Focused on working directly with forbidden emotions and
          behaviors, this path allows the seeker to transcend obstacles to
          liberation through sexual union. According to the Kaula Upanishad, “In
          your behavior do the opposite to what the norms dictate but remain in
          consciousness.” This is the essence of Tantra. Kali is absolute
          reality: manifested as woman intoxicated by desire, she frees the
          tantric practitioner from all desire except union with the divine.
          <br />
          <br />The author includes an evocative ritual from the Nirrutara
          Tantra--never before translated into any Western language--containing
          devotions to the 64 yoginis according to Matsyendranath, founder of
          the Kaula path. Offering devotional chants, meditations, and mudras
          specific to Tantric worship of Kali, this empowering book provides
          practices and teachings for those on the Tantric path to liberation.

          “<i>Tantric Kali</i> provides depth as we are guided through
          mythology, ritual, visualization, and life teachings to have a direct
          experience of Shakti from the wisdom teachings of the Kaula path.
          Daniel offers another treasure from the heart of his
          realization—steeped in his lineage with translations of the oldest
          ritual to Kali--songs and hymns and truly transformative practices and
          meditations direct from the root. A full-spectrum offering, this is
          the birth of another Odier classic. Daniel is one of the extraordinary
          and skillful practitioner teacher-scholar-writers of our time.
          <i>Tantric Kali</i> is juicy, liberating, radical, and exquisite and
          offers a unique compendium of tantric Kali sadhana accessible to all.”
