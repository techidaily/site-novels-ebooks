        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Haemin Sunim</b> is a Korean Zen Buddhist teacher and author of two
          bestselling books,
          <i>The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down</i> and
          <i>Love for Imperfect Things</i>. His books have sold over 6 million
          copies worldwide and have been translated into 38 languages. Born in
          South Korea, he came to the United States to study film, only to find
          himself pulled into the spiritual life. Educated at UC Berkeley,
          Harvard, and Princeton, he received formal monastic training in Korea
          and taught at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts for 7 years.
          His books are popular as guides not only to meditation but also to
          overcoming the challenges of modern life. When not traveling to share
          his teachings, Sunim lives in Seoul, where he founded Dharma
          Illumination Zen Center offering meditation retreats and counseling
          programs.
