            >Internationally renowned biophysicist and healing facilitator Dr.
            Joyce Hawkes blends science and spirituality to show how you can
            develop your own capacity for self-healing to improve your overall
            health and well-being.</b
          ><br /><br />After a shattering near-death experience Joyce Whiteley
          Hawkes left her career as a biophysicist and embarked on an intensive
          exploration of indigenous healing practices. Living and working with
          priests and shamans in the Philippines, South India, and Bali, she
          explored the previously uncharted territories that divide biology from
          spirituality—discovering that emotional, mental, and spiritual
          feelings can have a powerful effect on our bodies at the cellular
          level.<br />
          <br /><i>Cell-Level Healing</i> invites you to explore your inner
          powers of transformation and regeneration to attain new levels of
          spiritual and physical health. With profound yet simple exercises,
          this book provides a guide to tap your innate healing abilities by
          showing the powerful connection between the mind, body, and spirit.

        <p>
          "<i>Cell-Level Healing</i> is a remarkable bridge between conventional
          cell biology and the far reaches of self and spiritual healing. Dr.
          Hawkes skillfully combines her solid scientific grounding and
          experience in mainstream biophysics with personal insights gained from
          a near-death experience and extensive training in the alternative
          healing arts. Hawkes beautifully demonstrates how science and
          spirituality can peacefully coexist and inform each other in
          beneficial and refreshing ways."<br /><b>—Dean Radin, PhD</b>, senior

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Joyce Whiteley Hawkes</b> received her Ph.D. in biophysics from
          Pennsylvania State University in 1971 and was a postdoctoral fellow
          with the National Institutes of Health at the Oregon Regional Primate
          Research Center. She subsequently published thirty-six manuscripts in
          scientific journals and worked as a supervisory research scientist
          with the National Marine Fisheries in Seattle, Washington. Dr.
          Hawkes's work was honored with a U.S. National Achievement Award, and
          she was elected to the position of Fellow in the American Association
          for the Advancement of Science. Following a near-death experience that
          inspired her to change careers, she earned a master's in pastoral
          ministry from Seattle University and extensively explored indigenous
          healing traditions throughout Southeast Asia alongside renowned native
          healers. Dr. Hawkes continues to share her gifts as a healer, teacher,
          and writer by presenting seminars nationally and internationally. She
          can be contacted via <span>www.joycehawkes.com</span>.
