            >From the British occultist and author, a classic study of what
            esoteric orders are and what they can offer initiates.</b
          ><br /><br />People have been interested in secret traditions since
          the beginning of time. Fraternal brotherhoods and sisterhoods, and
          secret orders of varying degrees exist in every country, race, and
          religion.<br /><br />In <i>Esoteric Orders and Their Work</i>, author
          Dion Fortune gets to the root of exactly what esoteric orders are,
          leaving no stone unturned. The chapter “Esotericism, Occultism, and
          Mysticism” defines what esotericism is in relation to exotericism—in
          layman’s terms, the inner life versus the outer one. In “The Origin of
          the Mysteries,” she looks at how esotericism grew hand-in-hand with
          the evolution of humankind, discussing how humans evolved from a group
          soul (still present in animals today, i.e.: packs of wolves) into a
          singular soul. “The Paths of the Western Tradition” is a discussion on
          the different schools that have developed (known as Rays) and how
          students, after having formed a solid base of knowledge, work through
          each ray on their way to becoming closer to an esoteric ideal. She
          expounds upon Masters in “The Evolution and Functions of the Masters.”
          We discover that they are not so much superhuman entities as beings
          who have learned all they need to know on the physical plane and now
          teach from the ethereal. Chapters such as “The Right and Left-Hand
          Paths” and “The Use and Power of Ritual” explain the differences
          between Black and White Occultism, and how long-kept-secret rituals
          taught only to initiates are used to further the order’s members along
          their paths.<br /><br />Today, in the centers of the civilized world,
          there is renewed interest in esoteric schools, and although they may
          be misunderstood by the mainstream, some of the noblest people have
          been among their advocates. This book removes the shroud of mystery
          and fear from esotericism and makes the Western Mystery Tradition
          accessible to anyone who has ever been curious about this fascinating
          spiritual path!<br /><br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dion Fortune (1891-1946), founder of The Society of the Inner Light,
          is recognized as one of the most luminous figures of 20th-century
          esoteric thought. A prolific writer, pioneer psychologist, powerful
          psychic, and spiritualist, she dedicated her life to the revival of
          the Western Mystery Tradition. She was also a member of the Order of
          the Golden Dawn, whose members included at various times such people
          as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and W.B. Yeats.
