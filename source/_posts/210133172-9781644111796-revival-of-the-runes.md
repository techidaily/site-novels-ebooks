          • Explores the five periods of runic revival: the Renaissance, the
          Enlightenment, the Romantic period, the early 20th century, and the
          late 20th century <br /><br />• Examines the use of runes by the
          foremost magicians and scholars of each era, including mystic and
          scholar Johannes Bureus, who developed his own integrated system of
          runology known as Adalruna <br /><br />• Reveals how the Nazi
          misguided use of the runes showed a lack of comprehension of what was
          being discovered by scientific rune scholars of the day <br /><br />In
          this exploration of the history of the runes from 1500 CE to the
          present day, Stephen Edred Flowers examines the five periods of runic
          revival: the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Romantic period, the
          early 20th century, and the late 20th century. For each period, he
          discusses both the scholarly studies and those focused on the esoteric
          mysteries of the runes--and how these two branches of study were at
          first intertwined yet diverged in later revivals. Focusing in
          particular on the first runic revival, Flowers examines the use of
          runes during the Renaissance by the foremost magicians and scholars of
          the era, including mystic and scholar Johannes Bureus, the
          “grandfather of integral runology,” who developed his own system known
          as Adalruna. <br /><br />In his examination of the runic reawakenings
          of the early and late 20th century, Flowers looks at how the runes
          were employed as part of a reassessment of Germanic identity, one
          school of which led to Nazi Germany. He explains how the Nazi use and
          abuse of the runes was misguided and revealed a lack of comprehension
          of what earlier rune scholars had discovered through their extensive
          studies of the past. He also offers a fresh look at the work of Guido
          von List and clears him of his guilt by association with the Nazis.
          <br /><br />Detailing the multilayered history of the runes, the
          author reveals the integrated way the predecessors of today’s rune
          workers thought and conceived of the runes, highlighting how their
          discoveries helped shape modern magical practices and scholarly
          studies. He calls for a return of integral runology as was practiced
          during the Renaissance and before. By reuniting the two branches of
          runic study, blending the scientific with the magical, we make way for
          new discoveries in runology and a chance for a full-scale reawakening
          of integrated runic knowledge.

          “An essential read for anyone who wishes to understand the runes as
          they relate to the reawakening of Germanic spirituality taking place
          today. <i>Revival of the Runes</i> provides a thorough and scholarly
          history of the runes, from their origins with the Older Futhark, the
          later development of the Younger Futhark, the runic resurgences that
          followed their decline in the Middle Ages, up to the present revival
          of which Stephen Flowers himself has been an essential part. This book
          examines runology from a scholarly as well as the magical standpoint
          of an accomplished runic practitioner.
          <i>Revival of the Runes</i> documents the survival of the runes over
          time and their repeated return to our awareness, showing that for us,
          like Allfather Odin himself, the mysteries of the runes are eternal,
          just waiting for us to take them up.”
