              and each other, from the wildly popular astrology columnist for
              <i>New York</i> magazine’s The Cut.</b

          <p>
            <br />Whether you believe in it or not, astrology’s job has never
            been to give us a preordained vision of the future, nor to sort us
            into twelve neat personality types, but to provide the tools and
            language for delving into our weirdest, best, most thorny
            contradictions, and for understanding ourselves and each other in
            our full complexity. The stars and the planets then are more like
            mirrors that show us who we are, that give us an understanding of
            how to be and how to move through the world; how certain people do
            it differently, and what we can learn by studying them.

            In <i>Madame Clairevoyant’s Guide to the Stars,</i> Claire
            Comstock-Gay brings the sky down to Earth and points to our popular
            “stars”—from Aretha Franklin to Mr. Rogers, from poets in Cancer to
            punk singers in Scorpio—to reveal what the sky has to teach us about
            being human. In this wise, lyrically written guide, she examines the
            twelve astrological signs, illuminating the ways each one is more
            complicated, beautiful, and surprising than you might have been
            told. Claire suggests that actually it’s okay, and even important,
            to be a seeker, to hunger for self-knowledge, and if astrology is
            the vehicle for that inquiry, so be it.

            <i>Madame Clairevoyant’s Guide to the Stars</i> offers a clear
            introduction to the basics and an innovative new framework for
            creatively using astrology to illuminate our lives on earth. It’s a
            road map to our internal world, yes, but Claire also reminds us that
            it’s still our job to navigate it. Combining both heavenly insights
            and the earthly wisdom of writers like Cheryl Strayed and Heather
            Havrilesky and the poetry of Patricia Lockwood and Mary Oliver,
            <i>Madame Clairevoyant’s Guide to the Stars</i> offers a fresh,
            profound, and fun way to look at ourselves and others, and perhaps
            see each more clearly. And in that way, this book is not just
            beautiful, but transformative.

          “Comstock-Gay is a luminous guide through the world of astrology. More
          so than the mathematically-minded manuals that I've paged through in
          learning about the heavens, her guide to the stars reads as a
          fascinating narrative, no matter what your sign. A fine, affirming
          study of humanity.” —

          “Claire Comstock-Gay has 'wrested abundance from a stingy world,'
          giving us a book that is about both the fun of astrology and how it
          can be taken seriously, analyzing public figures as various as Cardi
          B, the Olsen Twins, Wislawa Szymborska, and Susan Sontag. Comstock-Gay
          complicates the simple archetypes that undergird our culture and our
          sense of ourselves and, with revelatory rigor, presents more
          productive ones.” —

          “Even before COVID-19 we lived in unpredictable times, and astrology
          layers an interpretative framework over the chaos of existence. But to
          its practitioners, astrology is more than just a pop culture
          phenomenon…. It was only when [Claire] learned about other aspects of
          her chart that she began to see astrology as capable of nuance and
          inflection rather than blunt, blanket assertions.
          <i>Madame Clairevoyant’s Guide to the Stars</i> takes a more
          thoughtful approach.” — <b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b>
