          <p>Some think, "Okay, another book about Jesus Christ."</p>
          <p>
            They say, "Right on, brother," but I have one up on that. All books
            should be written about Jesus Christ the Nazarene. There is no other
            game in town, none, Jesus is the only thing going on. The reason for
            this being twofold.
          </p>
          <p>First, Christ's imminent return is apparent to most.</p>
          <p>
            Second, God is answering our cries and our pleas in the face of our
            crumbling and disintegrating world that has no hope in sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the hands of God, however, we have hope for all things, for Jesus
            said, "With God, nothing is impossible. "The one thing most are
            still stumbling over, and yet still not discovering is this God/Man
            named Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The facts have been handed down to us through eyewitnesses. At
            first, it was just an oral communication, but Jesus Christ inspired
            the Apostles and Paul, the chosen of God, for us Gentiles and
            inspired them to write for us undeniable testimonies of Jesus. They
            wrote of His beginnings and his mission to Earth in the Holy
            Gospels. And Paul wrote a great number of the Holy Epistles of our
            Bible given to Him with abundance of revelation by God. All which
            are good for our knowledge of Jesus Christ and his mission to Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jesus wants us to make Him known to all men. Why? Because Jesus
            said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the Light." This is central to
            every Word written in the Bible. Jesus's last Words to His disciples
            on Ascension Sunday were, "Go and preach." In a nutshell, that means
            yes, make Jesus known to mankind. Publicize it, broadcast this
            knowledge; every one of us is to be laboring at this command. God
            help those that think it is enough to sit in their easy chair and
            pay tithes and go to Church on Sabbath. No and no, because the
            knowledge of Jesus Christ the Nazarene must "cover the Earth as the
            waters cover the Sea." "Go and make disciples of all Nations," and
            then the end shall come.
