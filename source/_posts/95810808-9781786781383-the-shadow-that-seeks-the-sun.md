            >An uplifting story of enlightenment that reveals simple yet
            profound truths about our true nature, set amidst the atmospheric
            banks of the River Ganges that will appeal to both the self-help,
            non-duality, and "Eat, Pray, Love" travel markets.</b
          ><br /><br />"No effort is necessary, Ray, no new knowledge required
          or acquired. No transcendental experience or higher consciousness
          needs to be achieved. When the recognition of what you are is seen -
          nothing at all happens. Why would it? You simply find yourself as you
          already are."<br /><br />It is widely thought that finding peace,
          happiness and freedom requires tremendous effort - that in order to
          achieve a state of contentment and harmony in life, a journey must be
          taken, or someone or something must be awakened or overcome.<br /><br />After
          a chance encounter with an Anglo-Indian holy man on the ghats of the
          sacred River Ganges, Ray Brooks discovers through the course of nine
          conversations that his quest for wholeness has been futile: no such
          journey was necessary, and, just like a shadow that seeks the sun, he
          had been searching for a self that had never been lost in the first
          place. After acknowledging that simple yet profound truth - that the
          seeker and that which is sought are one in the same - the search for
          "oneness" is complete.<br /><br />This book offers no systems of
          belief or promises. Instead, it clearly points to that which is
          ever-present yet completely overlooked: the ordinariness and beauty of
          our true nature.

        <p>
          The Shadow That Seeks The Sun is a pristine transmission of the
          teachings of oneness which many attempt but few portray so lucidly or
          masterfully. For this reason alone Ray Brooks is in a select lineage
          of teachers who share pure authenticity and essential truth ---and
          deliver real medicine for the heart.<br /><br />"As a travel writer I
          know about the journey that has to be taken to find unique and
          enriching experiences. Ray Brooks shares his fabulous and humorous
          encounters in Rishikesh, India with honesty and affection and guides
          the reader through the most important meeting of his life. A must read
          for travellers and spiritual seekers alike."<br /><br />Lindsay
          Hawdon, Author of Jakob’s Colours and travel writer, An Englishwoman
          Abroad, The Sunday Telegraph, The Times, LA Times<br /><br /><br />“This
          beautiful book certainly deserves to be included with the luminaries
          of spiritual literature. Its essence presents the essential, non-dual
          understanding of not just the author and his many influences but the
          foundation of all great religious and spiritual traditions.”&nbsp;<br /><br />--Alcvin
          Ryūzen Ramos, Shakuhachi master/ teacher and recording artist<br /><br />"Stories
          with well-constructed dialogue and believable characterisation can
          sometimes offer a terrain filled with insight, revelation and
          realization that often non-fiction fails to deliver.<br /><br />"Through
          this series of Nine Talks between Ray (the seeker) and Rudra (the
          realised teacher), we are taken back and forth on the time track to
          places and times that have deeply impacted the author, creating a
          powerful narrative and teaching device of clarity, insight and
          awakening.<br /><br />"The story starts with Rudra, who is actually a
          quite believable blend of various teachers including Swami Dayananda,
          J. Krishnamurti, Rupert Spira and&nbsp; Francis Lucille, replying to
          Ray’s questions about life while sitting together&nbsp; on the Ghats
          in Rishikesh. The answers that follow lead Ray back into his own
          life’s trajectory to his search’s beginning as an open minded, open
          eyed deeply curious seeker looking for truth, after having an
          “awakening experience” in a nightclub in London in the ‘70s. This
          quickly lands him at the feet of the&nbsp;“guru’s guru”&nbsp;J.
          Krishnamurti in the Ojai Valley where no time is wasted, as the famous
          teacher firmly places Ray on the “pathless path” to his own insight
          and awakening with his words: “There actually are no experiences.”<br />Reconciling
          this insight with the awakening experiences that flow through the
          story is what delivers Ray to his eventual clarity that, “There is
          nothing to overcome … no-one to be found … you were never
          bound&nbsp;…&nbsp;&nbsp;never<i>&nbsp;not</i>&nbsp;free.<br /><br />"This
          engaging account naturally ends where it begins, in THIS very moment
          where in Krishnamurti’s view, “No matter where you find yourself, no
          matter what background you come from, no matter what state of mind
          you’re in, you can still clearly look and see what is actually going
          on, but the observation has to be choiceless and unconditional.”<br /><br />--Enza
          Vita, author of&nbsp;<i>Instant Prescence</i>
