            >People have moved away from Mother Earth, bringing heartache, pain,
            and other maladies of the modern age. The “self-help” movement
            claims to offer peace and fulfillment to individuals, but this
            solitary approach takes us only so far. Ultimately, it is in
            communion with our fellow beings and the natural world that we are
            made whole. We need to leave the path of Me and follow the path of
            We.<br /><br />This poetic, evocative story presents the meditations
            of an ancient Anasazi tribesman who rejects his family and sets off
            on a journey through the desert. He walks seven paths, each teaching
            a lesson symbolized by an element of the natural world: light, wind,
            water, stone, plants, animals, and, finally, the unity of all beings
            with the Creator. The Seven Paths reveals a source of wisdom,
            restoration, and renewal familiar to native people but lost to the
            rest of us, seven elements among nature that combine to mend human
            hearts.</span

            >“There is much to learn from any person who has lived his life
            trying to heed the wisdom he has gathered from the lingering voices
            of his ancestors—especially in an age, like our own, when those
            voices have been spurned. Ezekiel Sanchez (Good Buffalo Eagle),
            cofounder of ANASAZI Foundation, is such a person. He has used the
            ancient, tested wisdom of his people to touch the souls of thousands
            of once- troubled young people and their families and show them the
            way to reunion and peace. Such a person also is his literary
            collaborator, Jim Ferrell. In The Seven Paths, they have distilled
            their unique and luminous insight. Reading this book receptively,
            you will likely catch yourself already forward walking in your heart
            and awakening to the light.”<br /></span

            she, too, had walked backward, away from her family. This profound
            discovery saved my daughter's life, which in turn saved our entire
            family. It gave her a solid foundation to navigate through her very
            difficult teenage years...it gave our lost child new feet to find
            her way—her path to becoming a loving, successful young adult with
            truly a heart at peace.”<br /></span

            >“ANASAZI Foundation's Seven Paths illustrates an oft-forgotten
            truth that it is not our experiences that determine the quality of
            our lives but who we are morally when we pass through those
            experiences. To walk in the light instead of in darkness means we
            see our experiences truthfully and learn and grow. When we betray
            the light within us, we walk in darkness and we find our experiences
            burdensome. This book is an invitation to all to live truthfully and
            distinguish toxic from nourishing ways of being in the world.”<br /></span
