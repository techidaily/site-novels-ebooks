            <i>Interviewed by God</i> is an account of Beth Banning's journey of
            spiritual awakening—her conscious connection with God and the
            lessons she's learned along the way. From a very young age, Banning
            experienced phenomena that could only be called extraordinary: she's
            received messages from spirit animals, felt <i>kundalini</i> energy
            awaken in her, and experienced dimensional shifts in her awareness
            that have allowed her to witness what only a few have seen. She was
            visited by totem animals, took ritualistic baths, and visited
            shamans and healers; she experienced ecstatic states and received
            messages; her ego mind began to battle against her higher mind. As
            she experienced her spiritual journey, a small voice within guided
            her. With doubt as her constant companion she continued to follow
            her inner promptings, which led her to higher levels of truth about
            her connection to herself and the world and reality as we know it.
            Written in a format in which the author is “interviewed by God,” the
            book is meant to be a mirror for the reader to reflect their own
            experiences back to them, and a gentle guide for those who are at
            the precipice of an extraordinary adventure and are either scared to
            jump or who hunger for answers and understanding.
