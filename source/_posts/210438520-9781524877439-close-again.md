            <i><b>New York Times</b></i
            ><b
              >&nbsp;bestselling author Ella Frances Sanders presents the book
              we all must have to remind ourselves of the things we miss from
              our pre-2020 lives and the things we will enjoy again, such as
              standing next to people in a coffee shop, at the movie theater, or
              in the bookstore....</b
            ><br />This book is a meaningful and personal illustrated collection
            of place, of chance, and of love. Moments, interactions,
            experiences, collisions, events, places, serendipities—the things
            that we all, as a collective and in-waiting humanity, are longing to
            fold back into. The carefree, now-historical moments of before that
            we dream about: the crossing of paths, the potential which was held
            within each day, the beautiful accidents of being alive that are not
            currently able to happen in the same ways.<br /><br />It allows a
            person reading it some space to consider their own missing, the
            chances left untaken and the stones left unturned. In a soft and
            beautiful way, it reminds us that the small things we as individuals
            choose to ascribe value to are valuable, that the meaning that makes
            up our days and weeks and months, if taken away, can leave us
            feeling directionless and full of emotional aches.<br /><br />Within
            the space of the book is hope, and reflection, and the assurance
            that we will all be close again.<br />&nbsp;
