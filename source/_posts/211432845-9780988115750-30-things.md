          <p>They say "It takes a village."</p>
          <p>
            And yet today it can be difficult, if not impossible, for others to
            penetrate the 'boundaries' that we all seem to build up around
            ourselves."No thanks. I can figure it out by myself."
          </p>
          <p>
            30 Things invites you to take a step back from that kind of
            individualistic mindset and consider a different model for your
            life. One that embraces a larger community.
          </p>
          <p>
            One that doesn't just value advice from others, but actively seeks
            out such help. One that is open-minded, attentive and committed to
            positive change.
          </p>
          <p>
            You won't find anything too 'preachy' in these pages. Nor is 30
            Things a book filled with lofty aspirations, pious platitudes or
            impossible goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bill Schaberg simply presents thirty different pieces of worthwhile
            advice that he has been given over the years, tells how each one
            first came to him, and then relates how he tried to incorporate them
            into his life.
          </p>
          <p>
            30 Things is a book of practical advice. Advice that - if actually
            put into practice - can help promote the book's promised goal of
            "living well".
          </p>
          <p>At least, that's been the author's experience.</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Hence, 30 Things... where he shares advice that he sincerely hopes
            might work for you too!

          30 ThingAs a licensed therapist specializing in substance abuse and
          erasing shame, I found 30 Things: Practical Advice for Living Well by
          William Schaberg to be a valuable source of wise and practical advice.
          This book provides an array of insights that are especially beneficial
          for therapists and their clients on a journey toward healing and
          self-improvement. Below are some key highlights and how they can be
          applied to therapy:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >You Can Pretend to Care, But You Can't Pretend to Be There</strong
          >
        </p>
        <span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>The importance of
        presence in relationships is highlighted by Schaberg, which is a vital
        concept in therapy. Being fully present with others builds trust and
        deepens emotional connections.<span
          class="ql-ui"
          contenteditable="false"
        ></span
        >Practice: Encourage clients to practice mindfulness in their
        interactions, focusing on truly being there for their loved ones without
        distractions.
        <p>
          <strong
            >Identify the Places Where You Encounter the Spiritual and Go There
            Often</strong
          >
        </p>
        <span class="ql-ui" contenteditable="false"></span>Finding and regularly
        visiting places that evoke a sense of spirituality or peace can be
        incredibly healing for clients. This advice promotes self-care and the
        importance of environments in emotional well-being.<span
          class="ql-ui"
          contenteditable="false"
        ></span
        >Strategy: Help clients identify their personal sanctuaries, whether
        physical places or mental states and incorporate regular visits to these
        spaces into their routines. And who doesn't want to understand the
        subconscious better?
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, 30 Things: Practical Advice for Living Well offers
          practical lessons that can significantly benefit therapeutic
          practices. Schaberg's insights provide clear steps for living a more
          fulfilling life.
