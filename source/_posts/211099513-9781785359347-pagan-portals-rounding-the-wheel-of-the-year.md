          Every month is full of magic, each day has its own energy, and the
          seasons rotate as part of the cycles of nature. Pagan Portals
          -&nbsp;Rounding the Wheel of the Year&nbsp;looks at ways to honour
          each month with folkloric customs, herb and plant lore, traditional
          crafts, spells, visualisations, and pagan rites that go beyond the
          eight festivals of Imbolc, Spring Equinox, Beltane, Summer Solstice,
          Lammas, Autumn Equinox, Samhain, and Winter Solstice. The wheel of the
          year turns smoothly, it doesn't bump over eight cogs, and that's the
          meaning of the title of this book. Inside these pages you will find
          the history behind some much-loved folklore and modern pagan customs,
          as well as practical suggestions for ways to celebrate the turning of
          the year.

        <p>
          In writing Rounding the Wheel of the Year Lucya Starza brings into
          focus the idea that magic pervades the entire year, every day, and it
          does just not just aggregate into eight isolated clusters, eight
          bulges spread on the circumference of a wheel. Through the research
          material, stories, and the materials offered for practical purposes,
          the author conveys not only the message, but the feeling that
          celebrations follow along seasonal changes rather then with the dates
          set in the calendar. An eclectic practitioner herself, Starza proposes
          ideas to suit a broad audience: her book is thus not a simple
          collection of rituals from a variety of traditions, but a complex
          resource meant to assist everyone interested in personalizing their
          spiritual practice and harmonize with the flow of seasonal energies.
          In writing Rounding the Wheel of the Year, Lucya Starza weaves
          together style, practicality, and thorough research. Right from
          beginning, the book debunks the myth of Wheel of the Year as an
          ancient, pan-Celtic tradition; instead, the author documents the
          modern origins by tracking back the sources that lead to the emerging
          of a Wheel of the Year concept, cycle made up of eight holy days. In
          explaining how appreciation of source materials have changed overtime,
          the author highlights people's changing relationship with the Wheel of
          the Year as a concept. This is a book for the individual as much as it
          is a book for the whole family: aside from bits of lore that reference
          deities and spirits related to seasons, the “Rounding the Wheel of the
          Year” is filled with delightful meditations, arts and crafts ideas,
          and activities to keep the joy alight every single day– whatever the
          time of the year.
