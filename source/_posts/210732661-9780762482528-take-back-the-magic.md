            >Renowned spiritual teacher and co-founder of The Way of the Rose
            Perdita Finn teaches the art and healing power of connecting with
            the dead, as she guides readers through the magical process of
            conversing with the unseen world.</b

            >"Finn weaves a spellbinding meditation . . . an affecting ode to
            the power of the unseen." —<i>Publisher's Weekly</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          What if you could live in a world where the guidance of those who were
          gone was available, right at your very fingertips? It's possible, if
          we are open to it. Anyone can reclaim the forgotten guidance of the
          dead, and&nbsp;anyone can return to the realm of magic and miracles.
          In&nbsp;<i>Take Back the Magic: Conversations with the Unseen World</i
          >, author, spiritual teacher, and co-founder of The Way of the Rose
          Perdita Finn reveals that life is beginningless, love is endless, and
          those who have passed don’t truly go anywhere when they die. Weaving
          together memoir, history, and a non-denominational spirituality based
          in ecology, Finn invites readers to live the experience that the
          stories of our lives are much older, bigger, and more merciful than we
          have been led to believe.<br /><br /><i>Take Back the Magic</i> takes
          the reader on a journey of healing, possibility, and love, as the
          story of how Finn healed her relationship with her bitter, patriarchal
          father long after his death unfolds over the course of thirteen moving
          chapters. Along the way, readers will learn how they, too, can
          reconnect with the generous guidance of the soul’s long story through
          deep time, recovering their lost relationships with their ancestors
          and the Earth itself.&nbsp;Throughout, Finn shares guidance, tips, and
          practical advice that will aid readers in forging their own
          relationships with those who have passed, as she invites every reader
          to reconnect with their own inner knowing and to call forth magic from
          the most ancient parts of humanity.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          An inspiring invitation to healing in this life, and to experience
          that we are never alone, <i>Take Back the Magic</i> shows that the
          whole world is simply souls reaching out to and finding each other—and
          no one is ever truly lost to us, if we allow ourselves to begin our
          own conversations with the unseen world.<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Perdita Finn </b>is the co-founder, with her husband Clark Strand,
          of the non-denominational international fellowship The Way of the
          Rose, which inspired their book
          <i
            >The Way of the Rose: The Radical Path of the Divine Feminine Hidden
            in the Rosary</i
          >. In addition to extensive study with Zen masters, priests, rabbis,
          shamans, and healers, she apprenticed with the psychic Susan Saxman,
          with whom she wrote <i>The Reluctant Psychic</i>. Finn now teaches
          popular workshops on Getting to Know the Dead, in which participants
          are empowered to activate the magic in their own lives with the help
          of their ancestors. She lives with her family in the moss-filled
          shadows of the Catskill Mountains.<br />
