          • Examines werewolf tales and stories from early Greece, Scandinavia,
          France, Germany, Eastern Europe, China, and Japan, as well as legends
          of other shapeshifting creatures such as were-tigers, were-jackals,
          and were-caribou <br /><br />• Looks at the various ways people become
          werewolves, including pacts with the devil, magic, and spells, and
          explores ways to identify, escape, and do away with werewolves
          <br /><br />• Includes the trial records from medieval Europe for
          individuals who were tried on suspicion of being werewolves and the
          personal records of people whose spouses could shapeshift into wolves
          <br /><br />An animal both mythical and real, a terrifying predator
          and the villain in many a fairytale, the wolf has haunted the human
          imagination since prehistoric times. Even more disturbing is the
          possibility that some individuals can change into wolves. These
          werewolves, or lycanthropes, are able to divest themselves of their
          human nature and transform into enemies that are all the more
          dangerous as no one knows who they are. Means of protecting oneself
          from this beast have been a concern for people since Classical
          Antiquity, and werewolf legends offer both fascinating tales of horror
          as well as advice for thwarting these creatures or breaking the
          werewolf curse. <br /><br />In this exploration of werewolf folktales,
          legends, and historical accounts, Claude Lecouteux examines werewolf
          beliefs and stories from early Greece to the post-medieval age,
          including the beliefs of the Norse and tales from France, Germany,
          Eastern Europe, China, and Japan. The author includes the trial
          records from medieval Europe for individuals who were tried on
          suspicion of being werewolves and the personal records of people whose
          spouses could shapeshift into wolves. He investigates the nature of
          the werewolf, how it can act as the double or lead to out-of-body
          experiences, and its counterparts in other parts of the world such as
          were-tigers, were-jackals, and even were-caribou in the Inuit regions
          of North America. Lecouteux also looks at the various ways people
          become werewolves, including pacts with the devil and spells, and
          explores ways to identify, escape, and do away with werewolves.
          Sharing werewolf mysteries from around the world, Lecouteux shows that
          by studying the legends of the werewolf we also gain insight into the
          psyche and ancient imagination of humanity.
