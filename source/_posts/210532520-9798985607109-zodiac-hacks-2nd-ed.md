              unique synergy of astrological wisdom with spiritual laws and
              archetypal energies supercharged with the starlight of the
              constellations and yet relatable to every aspect of your

            Packed with practical tips and intense yet accessible spiritual
            guidance, this book uses the metaphor of computers-with your sun
            sign as your "software"-to make astrological, karmic, tarot, and
            archetypal concepts less intimidating to readers. Xander's style of
            astrology emphasizes choice over fate, encouraging readers to walk
            the path of their own destiny using their chart as their map.

        <p>
          "Experience in, knowledge of, or even belief in astrology is not
          required. Before Zodiac Hacks, I saw astrology books as pretty much
          incomprehensible. I'd come across technical terms like "precession of
          the equinoxes," my eyes would glaze over, and I'd close the book. Not
          so with Zodiac Hacks! Finally, a beautifully written astrology book
          that explains things in a practical manner that totally makes sense to
          me. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy because Zodiac Hacks
          is, at its core, a step-by-step guide to living a good life, a life
          filled with happiness, love, friendship, success, health, prosperity,
          and an abundance of all that is good, beautiful, and true. Filled with
          tons of tips for every month of the year, no matter what sign you
          are-though it will certainly give you a whole lot of "Ahas" when you
          read the chapter that's about your birth/sun sign, your rising sign,
          or the sign your moon is in-Zodiac Hacks is all about illuminating
          what your strengths are and what's standing in your way and how to
          blast through any obstacle and optimize your innate talents. In other
          words, it's about hacking the Zodiac. From the very first page, I was
          hooked. After reading the riveting introductory/overview material, I
          went to the Cancer chapter (since I bought the book during Cancer).
          Immediately, Zodiac Hacks made sense of things I'd been feeling within
          myself and noticing in the people around me but couldn't put my finger
          on. Bottom line: I'm hacking the Zodiac(!) and will return to this
          book again and again for its timeless wisdom and advice." - Laurie

        <p>My Guide to Becoming a Better Human</p>
        <p>
          "<span style="color: rgba(15, 17, 17, 1)"
            >I have been using this book since last fall with the publication of
            the first edition. I quickly realized through this book that in
            seeking to craft a more desirable reality for myself through
            understanding the zodiac, I was at the same time learning to become
            a better human. I love reading about each sign and how it plays out
            in our reality. Even more, I love how this book is guiding me,
            reminding me, to trade hatred for love, ego for humility, judgment
            for compassion and so on. Rather than a guilt-inducing, preachyness,
            the tone is light-hearted and tastefully entertaining. Plus, it is
            well organized to be quick reference friendly. I urge you to pick up
            this book and you'll not only learn a wealth of info about the
            zodiac but also human behavior and how we operate within this
            beautiful system of the zodiac." - Julie C Ellsworth
