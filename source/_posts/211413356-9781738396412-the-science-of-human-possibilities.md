          “Drawing from the wisdom of Vivekananda and the Upanishads, this
          enlightening book offers a global audience insight into unlocking
          their innate talents and navigating the journey of self- discovery.”

          “Dr. Murty and this book propose an evolved model of thought — one
          that merges science and spirituality without contradiction. He
          presents a convincing narrative where evolution and spirituality are
          complementary not competing forces. As asserted in the chapter on good
          wishes, it is my wish that all who have the good fortune of reading
          this book benefit from his unique perspective as a thought leader in
          both mathematics as well as in matters of a spiritual nature.”

          “Kumar Murty is a one-person interdisciplinary university department.
          In addition to his ground-breaking contributions to Mathematics, he
          has now given us a fascinating book about human development,
          spirituality, self-doubt and self-discipline. Patiently developing his
          ideas in an engaging and accessible way, Murty explores traditional
          Indian thought as well as modern science.”&nbsp; —<b

          “Until now, I'd never come across a book by a professional
          mathematician who draws on ancient Indian philosophy and modern
          research to invite us all to reach for our higher selves. Given how
          polarized and foreclosed our own epoch too often feels,
          <i>The Science of Human Possibilities</i> couldn’t have arrived at a
          more urgent time.”&nbsp; —<b

          “Dr. Murty’s book serves as a unique and colourful invitation to lean
          into a certain hidden wholeness of life, to discover through the
          integration of ancient teachings and modern science the ‘light
          within.’”&nbsp;<b>

          “The long philosophical tradition of Vedanta that these reflections
          are imbued with, from the reading of the classics to the experience of
          modernity, presents itself as a discipline of individual development,
          toward the full realization of human possibility.”<b>&nbsp;</b> —<b

          practical advice—such as: keep only a short ‘to do’ list, or more’s
          the point keep a ‘not to do’ list. I’m glad to have put reading
