            Experimenting with the Truth reflects the long path Prabhuji has
            walked throughout his life. In this compilation of answers to
            sincere seekers, he shares his wisdom and erudition with those who
            wish to delve deeper into topics such as enlightenment, meditation,
            devotion, concentration, and so on. Prabhuji does not address us as
            a master or guru, but as a friend and traveling companion. He does
            not teach but encourages us to undertake our own search. Instead of
            offering answers, he invites us to observe, inquire, investigate,
            and explore by ourselves. Emphatically criticizing organized
            religion, he presents pearls of wisdom revealed in the sacred
            scriptures, which expose the same Truth dressed in a diversity of
            ways in different cultures.

            “Just as various colors form a beautiful painting, numerous
            spiritual paths create a wonderful harmony; and it is in this
            harmony where they all meet. If we hear musical notes without the
            rest of the symphony, we will not enjoy the melody. If we pay
            attention to a single color, we will be unable to appreciate the
            painting. But if we dare to observe the harmony expressed by all the
            individualities, we will perceive the Truth.”

          "It is impossible to have Truth delivered to our house like a pizza.
          Nothing and no one can bring reality to our illusion, so we must rise
          up to the Truth ourselves. We cannot make it to the summits of the
          Himalayas by descending into the valleys. If we wish to reach the
          peak, we must leave the valley and climb the mountain."

          "If we are only identified with what is apparent, our life unfolds on
          the surface. When we live based on the mind, superficiality prevails
          in each and every way. Those who identify themselves with the physical
          body consider the mind to be their inner world. Only one who has
          recognized consciousness can notice that thoughts belong to the
          surface, and, upon transcending the mind, realize absolute bliss."
