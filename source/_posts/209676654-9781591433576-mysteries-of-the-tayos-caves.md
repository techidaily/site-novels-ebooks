          A detailed examination of the controversial expeditions to the Tayos
          Cave complex in Ecuador and the treasures glimpsed in its depths
          <br /><br />• Reconstructs the expeditions from the 1960s and ’70s,
          including the Mormon Church’s search for lost tablets, Stanley Hall’s
          quest with Neil Armstrong, and sightings of a metal library, books of
          gold, copper plates, and a quartz sarcophagus <br /><br />• Includes
          photos from the author’s own dangerous expeditions to the Tayos Caves
          <br /><br />• Explores connections to Atlantis, Ancient Astronauts,
          and the Hollow Earth theory and the possibility of tunnel networks
          that extend from the Rocky Mountains to Patagonia <br /><br />The
          Cuevas de los Tayos is a cavern complex in the Amazon rain forest of
          Ecuador. Named for the <i>tayos</i>, the oil birds that reside within
          them, these caves have countless enigmas connected with them, from the
          discovery of inexplicable architectural details, to claims of curses
          and treasures, to dangerous encounters with the indigenous people, the
          Shuar, for whom the caves are sacred. <br /><br />Sharing his more
          than 30 years of research into the Tayos Caves as well as his own
          explorations, Alex Chionetti examines the legends and mysteries
          associated with this site and the explorers who have ventured within.
          He details the discovery of the Tayos Cave complex by Hungarian
          explorer Janos Juan Moricz in the 1960s, including Moricz’s claims of
          finding a metal library with books of gold. Exploring the oral
          tradition of the Shuar, he explains how this region was the possible
          origin of Incan culture and the legend of El Dorado. The author shares
          his own dangerous explorations within the Tayos Caves, and, drawing on
          unpublished interviews with speleologist Julio Goyén Aguado, he
          reconstructs the expeditions of the 1960s and ’70s, revealing the
          Mormon Church’s search for lost tablets, a British army incursion, and
          sightings of paintings, gold statues and skeletons, copper plates, and
          a quartz sarcophagus--treasures akin to the Crespi treasure. The
          author also shares details from Stanley Hall’s suspicious expedition
          in 1976, which included astronaut Neil Armstrong.
          <br /><br />Investigating the lost civilizations behind the Tayos
          treasures, Chionetti explores the possible connections to Atlantis,
          aliens, Ancient Astronauts, and the Hollow Earth theory; the caves’
          links with hermetic societies; and claims of tunnel networks that
          extend thousands of miles through both American continents, from the
          Rocky Mountains to Patagonia. Sharing a real-life adventure story
          wilder than an Indiana Jones plot, the author shows that Earth’s
          ancient past has many secrets waiting to be uncovered.
