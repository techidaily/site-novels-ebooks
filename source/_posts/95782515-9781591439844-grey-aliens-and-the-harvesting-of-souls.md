          Exposes the agenda behind the bio-robotic grey aliens’ genetic
          manipulation of certain human races <br />
          <br />• Reveals the Grey’s nature as sophisticated self-aware machines
          created by a long vanished extraterrestrial civilization <br />
          <br />• Explains how their quest to capture human souls appears in the
          historical record from biblical times <br />
          <br />• Explains how the phenomenon of racism is a by-product of their
          genetic tampering <br />
          <br />In 1997 Nigel Kerner first introduced the notion of aliens known
          as Greys coming to Earth, explaining that Greys are sophisticated
          biological robots created by an extraterrestrial civilization they
          have long since outlived. In this new book Kerner reveals that the
          Greys are seeking to master death by obtaining something humans
          possess that they do not: souls. Through the manipulation of human
          DNA, these aliens hope to create their own souls and, thereby, escape
          the entropic grip of the material universe in favor of the timeless
          realm of spirit. <br />
          <br />Kerner explains that genetic manipulation by the Greys has
          occurred since biblical times and has led to numerous negative
          qualities that plague humanity, such as violence, greed, and
          maliciousness. Racism, he contends, was developed by the aliens to
          prevent their genetic experiments from being compromised by breeding
          with others outside their influence. Examining historical records,
          Kerner shows that Jesus, who represented an uncorrupted genetic line,
          warned his disciples about the threat posed by these alien
          interlopers, while Hitler, a pure product of this alien intelligence,
          waged genocide in an attempt to rid Earth of all those untouched by
          this genetic tampering. Despite the powerful grip the Greys have on
          humanity, Kerner says that all hope is not lost. Greys exist wholly in
          the material world, so if we follow the spiritual laws of
          reincarnation and karma, aiming for enlightenment and rising above the
          material--a state the Greys are unable to reach--we can free ourselves
          from their grasp.

          "All in all I can't recommend this book highly enough to the serious
          minded reader. Scientist or philosopher, if you can hitch up your
          prejudices for a moment and I for one know how difficult this is, and
          give this a go, you'll find this book a very interesting read at the
          very least and one that might inspire you to take these ideas further.
          It provides not just the most terrifying warning of our predicament as
          a species, but it also gives us a deeply realistic look at the
          marvelous alternative that waits those who heed this warning. It's
          life-transforming stuff."
