            In this award-winning book of spiritual guidance, Mary Magdalene
            brings us the Feminine aspect of Yeshua's (Jesus's) teaching.
            Through 25 profound messages, Mary illuminates topics rarely
            addressed in the spiritual world -- uniting the Feminine and
            Masculine, healing body shame, the sacredness of sexuality, and
            emotional mastery -- all leading to living in the heart. Each
            message is paired with the author's clarifying commentary, taking us
            even deeper into Maryâ€™s truths.
          </p>
          <p>
            This long-hidden instruction reveals Mary as a tower of Feminine
            leadership, in complete union with her beloved male partner
            (Yeshua). Whether you're new to Mary Magdalene or a longtime admirer
            of hers, MARY MAGDALENE BECKONS is a gift to your soul.
