          What are UFOs?<br />Why are they here?<br />What is the Government not

            >Exposed, Uncovered, and Declassified: UFOs &amp; Aliens</i
          >
          strives to address all of these questions--and more--by covering new
          evidence of famous sightings and contact with aliens, and uncovering
          classified files from world-class collections and archives--all
          courtesy of the world's leading experts on modern ufology.<br /><br />Nuclear
          physicist and world-renowned UFO expert Stanton T. Friedman discusses
          how close we really are to interstellar travel.<br /><br />Erich von
          Daniken, father of the ancient astronaut theory, discusses the
          possibility and evidence of ancient hybrid creatures created by
          visiting god-like aliens.<br /><br />Nick Pope, former member of the
          British Ministry of Defence, covers the latest UFO documents released
          by the UK's National Archives, including such fascinating information
          as: what Churchill knew, why the documents are being released now,
          what's in them, and what's still being withheld.<br /><br />Donald R.
          Schmitt, the former co-director of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO
          Studies, takes on the aftermath of the Roswell incident, discussing in
          detail the initial stages of the government's cover-up attempts.<br /><br />Air
          Force veteran Thomas J. Carey chronicles the military's attempts to
          intimidate people into not telling their stories about what they have
          seen with their own eyes.<br /><br />The niece of Betty and Barney
          Hill, Kathleen Marden, gives a short history of cases of alien
          abduction, many which continue to baffle the American public and UFO
          investigators alike.<br /><br />Nick Redfern provides a fresh take on
          the famous 1953 UFO crash in Kingman, Arizona, and explores its
          possible connection to a government program to reverse-engineer alien
          spacecraft.<br /><br />Something is out there, and
          <i>Exposed, Uncovered, and Declassified: UFOs &amp; Aliens</i> will
          help us find out exactly what--or who--it is.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Michael Pye</b> has been an acquisitions editor for New Page Books
          since 2003. He developed a healthy appetite for the unexplained by
          watching far too many episodes of <i>In Search Of </i>hosted by
          Leonard Nimoy after school instead of doing his homework, which turned
          him into a reader of books on the strange and unexplained. He earned a
          BA in English from Southern Connecticut State University.&nbsp;
          <b>Kirsten Dalley</b> has functioned in various editorial capacities
          at New Page Books since 2004. She is coauthor of
          <i>The Nightmare Encyclopedia</i>, along with Jeff Belanger. She
          graduated from Columbia University with a BA in comparative
          literature, which has proven to be of use in both her career and her
          leisure pursuits (reading fiction and riding sportbikes).&nbsp;
          <b>Stanton T. Friedman</b> is a nuclear physicist who worked on a wide
          variety of advanced, classified nuclear systems for major industrial
          companies. He began the civilian investigation of the Roswell
          Incident; wrote<i> Flying Saucers and Science</i> and
          <i>TOP SECRET/MAJIC</i>; and coauthored
          <i
            >Crash at Corona, Captured! The Betty and Barney Hill UFO
            Experience</i
          >, and <i>Science Was Wrong</i>. He has appeared on hundreds of radio
          and television programs. Friedman resides in Fredericton, New
          Brunswick, Canada.&nbsp; <b>Erich von Däniken</b> is arguably the most
          widely read and most-copied nonfiction author in the world. He
          published his first (and best-known) book,<i> Chariots of the Gods</i
          >, in 1968. The worldwide best seller was followed by 40 more books,
          including the recent best sellers
          <i
            >Twilight of the Gods, History Is Wrong, Evidence of the Gods,
            Remnants of the Gods</i
          >, and <i>Odyssey of the Gods</i> (all published by New Page Books).
          His works have been translated into 28 languages and have sold more
          than 65 million copies. Several have also been made into films. Von
          Däniken's ideas have been the inspiration for a wide range of
          television series, including the History Channel's hit
          <i>Ancient Aliens</i>. His research organization, the
          A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com (Archaeology, Astronautics &amp; SETI
          Research Association), comprises laymen and academics from all walks
          of life. Internationally, there are about 10,000 members. He lives in
          Switzerland but is an ever-present figure on the international lecture
          circuit, traveling more than 100,000 miles a year.
