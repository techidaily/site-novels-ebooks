          An exploration of the origins, influences, and legacy of the
          scandalous Hell-Fire Clubs of the 18th century and beyond
          <br /><br />• Reveals the club’s origins in the work of Rabelais and
          the magical practices of John Dee and how their motto, “Do What You
          Will,” deeply influenced Aleister Crowley <br /><br />• Explores the
          cross-fertilization of liberty and libertinage within these clubs that
          influenced both U.S. and French Revolutions <br /><br />• Examines the
          debaucherous activities and famous members of many Hell-Fire Clubs,
          including Sir Francis Dashwood’s Monks of Medmenham
          <br /><br />Mention the Hell-Fire Clubs and you conjure up an image of
          aristocratic rakes cutting a swath through the village maidens. Which
          is true, but not the whole truth. The activities of these clubs of
          upper-class Englishmen revolved around not only debauchery but also
          blasphemy, ritual, quasi-magical pursuits, and political intrigue.
          <br /><br />Providing a history of these infamous clubs, Geoffrey Ashe
          reveals their origins in the work of François Rabelais and the
          activities of John Dee. He shows how the Hell-Fire Clubs’
          anything-goes philosophy of “Do what you will”--also Aleister
          Crowley’s famous motto--and community template were drawn directly
          from Rabelais. The author looks at the very first Hell-Fire Club,
          founded by Philip, Duke of Wharton, in 1720 and then at the Society of
          the Dilettanti, a fraternity formed in 1732. Ashe examines the life,
          travels, and influences of Sir Francis Dashwood, founding member of
          the Society of the Dilettanti and the scandalous Permissive Society at
          Medmenham, also known as the Monks of Medmenham. He also explores
          other Hell-Fire clubs the movement inspired throughout England,
          Scotland, and Ireland, including the violence-prone Mohocks and the
          Appalling Club. He shows how many illustrious figures of the day were
          members of these societies, such as Lord Byron. He also examines the
          rumors that Benjamin Franklin was a member, an allegation that can be
          neither confirmed nor denied. <br /><br />Exploring the political and
          magical ideas that fueled this movement, the author shows how the
          cross-fertilization of liberty and libertinage within the Hell-Fire
          Clubs went on to influence both the U.S. and French revolutions, as
          well as the hippie movement of the 1960s, the Church of Satan founded
          by Anton LaVey, and the motorcycle club known as the Hells Angels. The
          legacy of the Hell-Fire Clubs continues to impact society, beckoning
          both elite and outsider to cast aside social norms and “do what you
          will.”
