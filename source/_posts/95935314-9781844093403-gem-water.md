          Effective and healthy remedies produced by infusing water with
          appealing crystalline energies are carefully described in this
          informative manual. The first part covers aspects of preparation,
          featuring deceptively simple processes such as the boiling method, the
          water vapor method, and the test tube method--all of which can be
          easily mastered by crystal healing enthusiasts. After outlining the
          correct methods to use and listing poisonous crystals as a safety
          precaution, the book examines more than 100 usable crystals and 34
          special mixtures, revealing their intended uses and effects for the
          optimum in therapeutic results.

          "Gem Water offers a whole new approach to using crystals. You’ll be
          awakened as you learn to prepare and use more than 130 crystal waters
          for therapeutic treatments. I personally never heard of this, so I was
          naturally intrigued and mesmerized. It features over a 100 crystals
          and 34 special mixtures with their effects. There are seven different
          methods of preparing gem water, and each is explained clearly. By far
          the easiest is simply placing a crystal directly in water. But, before
          you make any gem waters, your crystals must be cleansed. Detailed
          steps walk you through the process. I had no idea this was necessary,
          and I’ve begun to cleanse the few crystals I have."

        </h4>
        <p>
          Joachim Goebel is an international lecturer, trainer, seminar leader,
          and industrial consultant, who has been researching gem waters since
          1998. Michael Gienger (1964-2014) was one of Europe’s most respected
          experts on crystals and their uses, a field in which he had been
          active since 1988. He started collecting minerals in 1972, and in 1985
          a successful self-treatment with healing crystals inspired him to
          pursue further training as an alternative healing practitioner. He was
          trained in shiatsu and completed a two-year apprentice in shamanic
          healing. He went on to author more than 20 publications, a number of
          which have become standard works in their field and have been
          translated into 11 languages.
