            GOD HIMSELF HAS WRITTEN THIS BOOK, BREATHED ON IT AND PLACED IT IN
            YOUR HANDS!
          </p>
          <p>
            HE TEACHES YOU HIS WAY ON HOW TO VISIT HIM AND HEAVEN WHENEVER YOU
            WANT… NOW!
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have many wonders in store for you. You will see when you come to
            Me. I do not withhold. I am here. I will not abandon you. I long to
            be with you. Come, and I will show you your path; your destiny. You
            will know why you are here. I will tell you. Come expecting gifts. I
            have so many things to tell you; to reveal to you; to give you.
            Come.” … GOD - from Chapter 7
          </p>
          <p>
            “My rare ones, do not think that you are not of much importance. I
            call out to the hearts of every person to come to Me. Rest with Me.
            Allow Me to calm the storms that come against you. Allow Me to clear
            the paths and quench your thirst. What you search for is here. It
            rests with Me and in this Kingdom. The world cannot touch your heart
            but with a dead finger. My hand contains life everlasting. Reach out
            for it, and it is there. I will not refuse you nor reject you. I
            will soothe your wounds. Come into Heaven and accept your
            inheritance. It waits for you. Your crowns are here. Your treasures
            are here. Do not abandon them, as your portion is set before you for
            a reason. Your inheritance is offered to you now, to partake of as
            you walk in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you will come to Me, the treasures of Heaven belong to you. Walk
            in your gardens and mountains. Eat of the fruits that are ripe. So
            much waits for you. Come.” … GOD - from Chapter 10
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Way was virtually lost into history, saved for a few who
            learned how to walk with God, in His image.
          </p>
          <p>
            God will speak to you directly on how you can find this lost ancient
            Way!
          </p>
          <p>
            He’ll show you The Way to come and visit with Him face-to-face in
            His throne room!
          </p>
          <p>
            He’ll teach you how to walk into Heaven whenever you like, to
            partake of all of its treasures!
          </p>
          <p>
            He’ll talk directly to you about your life, to comfort you and love
            you!
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll learn how to see and have angels protect you and work with
            you!
          </p>
          <p>
            God will teach you how to tap into unlimited wealth that He’s had
            waiting for you before you were born!
          </p>
          <p>
            God will show you how only He can provide you with the secrets to
            life and success, as He says that the ways and secrets that man
            provides are a fool’s errand and have become their powerless gods.

        <p>TESTIMONIES FROM THE SILVER BULLET OF GOD</p>
        <p>
          "You are the first person I have ever heard of that deals in the
          Spiritual realm at the level that you do. You are like a “Green Beret
          “or “Navy SEAL” in the spiritual, and I don’t think that there are
          that many like you in the world." Rochelle H. – USA

          "Am introducing all to my University students here in Nigeria. We, at
          Kingdom Life Christian University, will be using Xtreme Big Game
          Hunting as part of our study materials to open the eyes of our
          students to have more knowledge about the spirit realm and how to be
          victorious."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

          “After training, one of the lady students prayed with my sister for
          healing of cervical cancer and she was instantly healed. She also
          received spiritual activation, the spiritual gifts in her doubled in
          operation. Just last week she was at her house sitting under a tree.
          She felt the Holy Spirit urged her to turn and look across to her
          neighbor’s house opposite a soccer field. There a child had just died
          and his parents were mourning. The Holy Spirit urged her to pray in
          tongues. She continued to pray until the child rose from the dead. The
          parents and all those around were very surprised but did not know what
          or how it happened. All the while my sister never approached them or
          even gone near them."&nbsp; Many blessings, Martin R., Papua New
          Guinea

          "I read your book last week, and it is the most powerful and most
          knowledgeable book I have read on spiritual warfare. In fact, I taught
          aspects of it to my Prayer Group of about 20 prayer warriors. I also
          applied the book at a recent crusade we had last Friday attended by
          2500 people in Dubai. I have shared the book with up to 10 Pastors in
          Dubai and more than 10 Brothers and Sisters in the UK, my home
          country. I have also shared it with more people in Dubai, Doha, and
          Lagos Nigeria. TO GOD BE THE GLORY FOR SUCH GREAT REVELATION. My
          prayer is that God will continue to establish and reward you for your
          faithfulness."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
