            >“Wake up from the slumber you are living in,and dream with your
            eyes open so that all thepossibilities of the future are available
            to you.”</b
          ><br /><br /><i>The Heart of the Shaman</i> will take you on a journey
          into the sacred world of the shaman, through stories, dreams, and
          ancient rites.<br /><br />In his latest book,
          <b>Alberto Villoldo</b> sets his focus on the dreaming and time-travel
          practices of the medicine men and women of the Andes and Amazon, whose
          wisdom radically changed his worldview. Villoldo shares some of their
          time-honored teachings that emphasize the <i>sacred dream</i>: an
          ephemeral, yet powerful vision that has the potential to guide us to
          our purpose and show us our place in the universe.<br /><br />The
          practices in this book will help you forge a sacred dream for
          yourself. They will help you craft a destiny infused with courage, and
          driven by vision. You’ll be invited to follow the footsteps of the
          luminous warrior and learn how to break out of the three nightmares
          surrounding love, death, and safety that have held you captive, and
          transform them into the experience of timeless freedom, known as the
          Primordial Light. This creative power exercised by shamans will lead
          you to create beauty and healing, and dream a new world into being.<br /><br />When
          you transform these dreams and accept that life is ever changing, that
          your mortality is a given and that no one except you can free you from
          fear —the chaos in your life turns to order, and beauty prevails.
