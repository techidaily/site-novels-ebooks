          Understand the importance and meaning of your life’s journey here on
          Earth—with the guidance and perspective of the souls in the hereafter.
          <br /><br />For nearly fifty years and more than thirty-five thousand
          sessions, George Anderson, widely considered the world’s greatest
          living medium, has listened to those who have crossed to the other
          side. He has bridged the worlds of the here and the hereafter by
          communicating messages of hope from loved ones who have passed on, in
          order to help bring peace to those who continue on earth. But the
          souls can offer so much more than proof that there is something beyond
          this world. They can offer answers and practical advice about issues
          we struggle with daily: our finances, relationships, personal matters,
          and questions of faith. Having lived through the struggles we now
          face, they can also assure us that life’s problems are not random;
          they happen to each of us as part of a greater purpose and plan.
          <br /><br /><i>Ask George Anderson </i>shares the most common
          questions clients ask and reveals the illuminating answers that the
          souls have provided on issues and concerns of our everyday life here
          on earth. They are invaluable lessons that will enrich all our lives
          because they’re imparted from a profound and rare perspective: that of
          the souls who have already lived it and learned from it.

        <p>
          GEORGE ANDERSON not only works in the United States conducting
          seminars, lectures, and private appointments, he also has found wide
          appeal in Europe, Asia, and South Africa. He was the first medium in
          history to appear regularly on a cable television show, the first
          medium to gain international exposure for his extraordinary ability,
          and the only medium to be cleared by Network Television Standards and
          Practices to appear on the first-ever primetime special on mediumship,
          Contact: Talking to the Dead. He is the only living medium to have
          been invited to Holland by surviving members of the family of Anne
          Frank, and remains the most scientifically tested medium on Earth..
          Anderson has been featured in newspapers and on television and is the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>Walking in the Garden of Souls</i> and<i>
            George Anderson’s Lessons from the Light. <br /></i
          ><br />ANDREW BARONE is executive director of the George Anderson
          Grief Support Programs and a cofounder of the Foundation of Hope, an
          organization that helps bring the comfort and solace of bereavement
          programs into communities across the United States and around the
          world. In 1997, he received from Kentucky Governor Paul Patton the
          commission of Kentucky Colonel for his work with the bereaved in that
          state. A former classical pianist, he has dedicated his skills and
          life experiences to helping others gain a better understanding of
          matters related to loss and dying and to furthering the acceptance of
          mediumship as a bona fide grief therapy. He is the coauthor of the
          <i>New York Times </i>bestseller
          <i>Walking in the Garden of Souls</i> and
          <i>George Anderson’s Lessons from the Light. </i>
