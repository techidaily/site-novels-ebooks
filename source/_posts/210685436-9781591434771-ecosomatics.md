            >How to develop the body’s innate intelligence for individual and
            planetary transformation</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains how healing ourselves and enacting inner
          change can also contribute to healing of the planet<br /><br />• Shows
          how ecosomatics—embodiment work for personal and planetary health—can
          help us shift our consciousness, heal individual and collective
          wounds, and uncover latent energetic, somatic, and psychic
          abilities<br /><br />• Shares ecosomatic and embodiment exercises to
          help you expand perception, develop somatic intelligence, let go of
          limiting beliefs, lessen fear and anxiety, and open to new levels of
          awareness<br /><br />The inner world of self and body is inextricably
          linked to the outer world of biosphere and biome. As experienced
          somatic and energy medicine practitioner Cheryl Pallant reveals in
          vivid depth, by expanding our sensory perceptions and becoming
          intimately in touch with the rhythms of the body, we can contribute
          not only to our own healing and transformation but also that of the
          planet. <br /><br />In this practical guide, Pallant explains how
          ecosomatics—embodiment work for personal and planetary health—can help
          us shift our consciousness through expanded listening with all our
          senses and embracing the interconnections between our inner and outer
          worlds. Blending research with personal experience in somatic and
          contemplative practices, the author explores how a broadened
          appreciation of conscious and unconscious bodily events and
          perceptions leads to vitally needed, improved stewardship with
          ourselves and the planet. She shows how the current health, social,
          and environmental crises are a chance for an evolution in
          consciousness, pushing us to heal the divisions within personal
          identity, between self and others, and with the environment.
          Throughout the book, the author offers ecosomatic and embodiment
          exercises to help you expand perception, develop somatic intelligence,
          let go of limiting beliefs, lessen fear, anxiety, and alienation, and
          open to levels of awareness that allow you to tune in to a greater
          vision of what is humanly possible. <br /><br />Revealing how to
          incorporate embodiment into everyday life, this guide shows how the
          body is a process that is part of nature, not separate from it, and
          that by embarking on the transformative inner journey, we can bring
          healing to the world around us.

          “Cheryl offers us a unique window into her world as an energy healer
          assisting people in becoming incorporated within their own earthy
          incarnation as a pathway to healing. Her ability to craft a sensual
          spell with words takes us on a rich journey through these varied
          perceptual layers of sensing, feeling, and understanding our place on
          and in the planet. She serves up many proverbial crumbs to find our
          way back home to a renewed wholeness.”
