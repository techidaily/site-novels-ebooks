          <p>
            Alfred Richard Orage (1873-1934), whom G. B. Shaw declared the most
            brilliant editor of the past century, suddenly laid down his pencil
            in 1922 and sold his famous journal&nbsp;The New Age&nbsp;to work
            with the mystic G. Gurdjieff in France. Orage hoped that with
            Gurdjieff's help, he could come to a more fundamental understanding
            of the human species. For Orage, modern man had come to the end of
            his tether, and without the development of new faculties, he was
            convinced that the problems that pile up in front of mankind would
            not be solvable, and even the very will to live must decline.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Gurdjieff claimed to have found a way to develop new and higher
            faculties, and to have been trained in the necessary methods and
            knowledge which had its sources in the hidden wisdom of the East.
            Orage worked intensively for more than a year with Gurdjieff in
            his&nbsp;Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man, and it
            seems that he had found what he was seeking.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Gurdjieff, on the other hand, found in Orage someone whom he
            considered a brother in spirit. A spirit that was defined by Orage
            some years before as: ". . . displaying itself in disinterested
            interest in things; in things, that is to say, of no personal
            advantage, but only of general, public or universal importance."
            When Gurdjieff expanded his activities into the New World, it was
            only consequent that Orage became his emissary there.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Orage arrived in New York in December 1923 to expound Gurdjieff's
            ideas, and until 1931, was talking to a growing group of interested
            people. This book contains the notes of many of these talks. We are
            grateful to the notetakers and their prudence to leave their papers
            to the universities of Yale, Berkeley and Leeds, who guaranteed the
            survival of these papers in their archives. Without all this
            combined effort, they would otherwise be scattered all over the
            world, largely unknown and "upon the verge of being irrecoverably
            lost" as C. Daly King once wrote. Along with&nbsp;Orage's Commentary
            on "Beelzebub's Tales to His Grandson,"&nbsp;this edition completes
            the record of Orage's meetings, talks and lectures on Gurdjieff's
            teaching.
