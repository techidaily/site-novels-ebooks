          A history of how mystical and spiritual influences have shaped
          Russia’s identity and politics and what it means for the future of
          world civilization <br /><br />• Examines Russia’s spiritual history,
          from its pagan origins and Eastern Orthodox mysticism to secret
          societies, Rasputin, Roerich, Blavatsky, and Dostoyevsky <br /><br />•
          Explains the visionary writings of the spiritual philosophers of
          Russia’s Silver Age, which greatly influence Putin today <br /><br />•
          Explores what Russia’s unique identity and its history of messianic
          politics and apocalyptic thought mean for its future on the world
          stage <br /><br />At the turn of the 20th century, a period known as
          the Silver Age, Russia was undergoing a powerful spiritual and
          cultural rebirth. It was a time of magic and mysticism that saw a
          vital resurgence of interest in the occult and a creative intensity
          not seen in the West since the Renaissance. This was the time of the
          God-Seekers, pilgrims of the soul and explorers of the spirit who
          sought the salvation of the world through art and ideas. These sages
          and their visions of Holy Russia are returning to prominence now
          through Russian president Vladimir Putin, who, inspired by their
          ideas, envisions a new “Eurasian” civilization with Russia as its
          leader. <br /><br />Exploring Russia’s long history of mysticism and
          apocalyptic thought, Gary Lachman examines Russia’s unique position
          between East and West and its potential role in the future of the
          world. Lachman discusses Russia’s original Slavic paganism and its
          eager adoption of mystical and apocalyptic Eastern Orthodox
          Christianity. He explores the Silver Age and its “occult revival” with
          a look at Rasputin’s prophecies, Blavatsky’s Theosophy, Roerich’s “Red
          Shambhala,” and the philosophies of Berdyaev and Solovyov. He looks at
          Russian Rosicrucianism, the Illuminati Scare, Russian Freemasonry, and
          the rise of other secret societies in Russia. He explores the Russian
          character as that of the “holy fool,” as seen in the great Russian
          literature of the 19th century, especially Dostoyevsky. He also
          examines the psychic research performed by the Russian government
          throughout the 20th century and the influence of Evola and the
          esoteric right on the spiritual and political milieus in Russia.
          <br /><br />Through in-depth exploration of the philosophies that
          inspire Putin’s political regime and a look at Russia’s unique
          cultural identity, Lachman ponders what they will mean for the future
          of Russia and the world. What drives the Russian soul to pursue the
          apocalypse? Will these philosophers lead Russia to dominate the world,
          or will they lead it into a new cultural epoch centered on spiritual
          power and mystical wisdom?

          “Russia is neither the West nor the East. It is both. And it
          participates in deep Christian mystical, indigenous, esoteric, and
          occult currents that were mostly lost or forgotten in Western
          Christianity and actively suppressed in secular modernity. In his new
          book, Gary Lachman shows us why the return of these esoteric currents
          via the new (and old) claim of a ‘Holy Russia’ is so important, why
          such nationalist theologies cannot really be our answer, but also why
          particular Russian thinkers can point us in the right
          direction--toward a ‘third way’ beyond pure reason and past faith
          toward a new or future gnosis, or knowing-with, that ‘all is good.’
          This sounds outrageous to many a modern ear, of course. Hence the
          importance of this book.”
