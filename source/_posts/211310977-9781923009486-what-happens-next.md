          <b>Answers about the afterlife</b><br /><br />Have you ever been alone
          but felt that you were not really alone at all; that someone else was
          there? You didn't feel scared, you felt comforted and you knew that
          the energy felt familiar, like that of a passed loved one. But your
          sceptical mind told you it was just your imagination. Signs from the
          spirit world come in many different ways; it could be just a small
          thing, such as sensing a presence or even the lights flicking on and
          off whenever you think about a passed loved one. Is this just
          coincidence, or is it more? In What Happens Next, spiritual/medium
          Jade-Sky shows you that it is possible to feel, sense or even hear
          your passed loved ones in spirit. In her work, Jade-Sky is asked
          hundreds of questions about life after death and here she answers them
          all, such as what happens to loved ones when they pass, including
          children, parents, partners, friends and even pets; how to recognise
          signs from passed loved ones; and all about angels, spirit guides and
          ghosts. Drawing on her many years of communicating with the spirit
          world Jade-Sky's sympathetic answers offer comfort and reassurance to
          anyone who wonders: 'What happens next?'

        </h4>
        <p>
          Jade-Sky is a Psychic/Medium-a “direct channeller”. She was born with
          a special gift of being able to connect clairvoyantly with energies of
          deceased loved ones. Over the past 15 years Jade-Sky has fine tuned
          her natural skills in the areas of tarot and oracle card reading,
          psychometry, mediumship/channeling and uncovering past lives.<br />
          <br />
          Jade-Sky has read professionally for over 7,000 clients around the
          world, who testify to her accuracy.<br />
          Mediumship is Jade-Sky’s passion. During a reading she offers up key
          names, dates and specific events to the enquirer so that they know
          without doubt that their passed loved ones or spirit guides/angels are
          with them. She also provides very personal and significant details to
          help clients reconnect with their loved ones, something which assists
          with their grieving process.<br />
          <br />
          By giving detailed information, Jade-Sky reassures her clients that
          life after death does exist and a beautiful place awaits us when we
          pass from this life to the next.As well as conducting private readings
          and workshops, Jade-Sky has spoken and appeared live on stage at the
          nation-wide Mind, Body, Spirit Festivals and featured on BIO5,2GB and
          NOVA radio stations.
