            >Two of today's maverick authors on anomalous experience present a
            perception-altering and intellectually thrilling analysis of
            <i>why the paranormal is real,</i> but radically different from what
            is conventionally understood.</b
          ><br /><br />Whitley Strieber (<i>Communion</i>) and Jeffrey J. Kripal
          (J. Newton Rayzor professor of religion at Rice University) team up on
          this unprecedented and intellectually vibrant new framing of
          inexplicable events and experiences. <br /><br />Rather than merely
          document the anomalous, these authors--one the man who popularized
          alien abduction and the other a renowned scholar and "renegade
          advocate for including the paranormal in religious studies" (<i
            >The New York Times</i
          >)--deliver a fast-paced and exhilarating study of <i>why</i> the
          supernatural is neither fantasy nor fiction but a vital and authentic
          aspect of life.<br /><br />Their suggestion? That all kinds of
          "impossible" things, from extra-dimensional beings to bilocation to
          bumps in the night, are not impossible at all: rather,&nbsp; they are
          a part of our natural world. But this natural world is immeasurably
          more weird, more wonderful, and probably more populated than we have
          so far imagined with our current categories and cultures, which are
          what really make these things seem "impossible." <br /><br /><i
            >The Super Natural</i
          >
          considers that the natural world is actually a "super natural
          world"--and all we have to do to see this is to change the lenses
          through which we are looking at it and the languages through which we
          are presently limiting it. In short: The extraordinary exists if we
          know how to look at and think about it.

          “A cohesive reframing of the ‘pantheon of the unknown’ … A
          thought-provoking, intelligent reconceptualization of supernatural
          events.” <b>–<i>Kirkus Reviews &nbsp;</i></b>
        </p>

          "This book is a dream come true. It has taken thirty years for the
          most articulate of abductees to be taken seriously by a senior
          academic. This dialogue between the famous abductee and the historian
          of religions is the first major step in ufology since Jacques Vallee’s
          writings of the 1990s. Whitley Strieber’s intelligence and honesty
          compel one to take his experiences seriously, though they may sweep
          the philosophical ground from under our feet. In taking up the
          challenge, Jeffrey Kripal avoids the simplistic reactions of both
          skeptic and true believer. Instead of pretending to have the answers,
          he asks mind-bending questions, whose very asking is an act of
          self-transformation. Their conversation sets off sparks that should
          rekindle the search after “rejected knowledge,” and integrate it with
          the great paradigm change of our time: the end of materialism."

          “Requires the reader to avoid the first great pitfall of thinking that
          ‘skepticism’ and belief are the only two options … very well written,
          surprisingly light, and fast-paced … They don’t pretend to have
          answers, but we get the feeling the right questions lie in this
          direction. Every serious fortean needs to read it.”—<b

          “If reading <i>The Super Natural </i>doesn't make your hair stand
          straight up, you need to read it again. This book is at once
          disturbing and disorienting, fascinating and lucid. Its ‘new vision of
          the unexplained’ dives headfirst into all sorts of strange but true
          encounters, from ravishing alien goddesses to loathsome blue gremlins.
          While this domain of human experience remains strictly taboo, it
          doesn’t stop hundreds of thousands of ordinary people from continuing
          to report bizarre encounters with we know not what. This remarkable
          book does not attempt to explain what is going on. But it does crack
          open your head long enough to provide a new perspective.” –<b

          "Something is happening here, and we're not sure what it is, but
          Kripal and Strieber have a clue: if there are aliens among us, they
          are ourselves, and we seem eager to make contact. This is a brilliant,
          provocative, and gripping new inquiry into the mysteries of time,
          space, and the human -- and not so human -- mind. Absolutely
          captivating; one could even say I was abducted..." –<b

        <i>&nbsp;</i> “A modern day descent into the rabbit hole,
        <i>The Super Natural </i>will blow your mind wide open, overturn beliefs
        about reality and the imagination, and challenge preconceived notions
        about life, death, and what falls in-between. Erudite, illuminating, and
        thoroughly exciting (not to mention quite funny at times), Strieber and
        Kripal’s collaboration takes a serious look at what many would consider
        an unserious subject and have written the most thought-provoking and
        important book on the essence and nature of unexplained phenomena in
        more than forty years.” –<b>Gary Jansen, author of <i>Holy Ghosts</i></b
        ><br /><br />“Fascination with the UFO phenomenon and with its extreme
        forms found in ‘abduction’ reports has triggered passionate debates
        about the nature of the manifestations, the reliability of human
        testimony, and the unavoidable parallels with initiatory states and
        certain mystical visions. Yet the ambiguity of the relationship with the
        creatures involved has remained unresolved. The controversy has
        reactivated fundamental debates about the role of archetypes, the power
        of the unconscious, and the transcendental meaning of sex. A novel way
        to approach the problem emerges in this exceptional book -- the product
        of a dialogue between an articulate experiencer and an erudite historian
        of religions. In the process we discover that the experiencer is also
        something of a historian, and the historian confesses he has not been
        untouched by the experience...What is at stake is nothing less than the
        nature of our reality, and our ability as humans to grasp levels of
        perception that are at once so dangerous and so sublime.” –<b
          >Jacques Vallee, author of <i>Passport to Magonia</i>,
          <i>Forbidden Science</i>, and <i>Wonders in the Sky </i></b
        ><br /><br />"Practically anything goes at the American Academy of
        Religion's annual conference...What was almost impossible to find, at
        this orgy of intellectual curiosities, was discussion of the paranormal:
        ESP, premonitions, psychic powers, alien abduction and the like. This is
        a conference concerned with all sorts of supernatural and metaphysical
        claims....So why nothing about, say, mental telepathy? That is the
        question posed by Jeffrey J. Kripal, a professor of religion at Rice
        University in Houston and a renegade advocate for including the
        paranormal in religious studies."
