            This book traces notable people in Western history who tried to
            decipher the mysteries of illness and health. I have chosen specific
            women and men for their unique perspectives in healing—some
            “traditional” physicians, shamans from Indigenous peoples, some
            focused on the body, some on the spirit. As a rule, they were
            individuals of compassionate character who felt for the miseries of
            humankind. But each one revealed to us a lesson. Each one
            illuminated the extreme complexity of humanness but also the extreme
            delicacy: human beings of organs and tissues and blood but also of
            worry and fear and sorrow. Suffering affects both. And each healer
            was human themselves.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The story will span antiquity to the present. Ancient Greece
            produced the earliest concepts of disease and illness, that one may
            affect the other. The cult of Asclepius, the man-god of healing,
            addressed spirits damaged by pernicious gods and worked to insert
            the supernatural in their healing schemes. Hippocrates, the great
            physician, instructed proper respect for the human constitution and
            urged compassion – qualities for healers as important today as then.
            The charismatic Jesus of Nazareth revolutionized healing practices
            by demonstrating a compassion for all infirmed people, particularly
            the impoverished, a behavior taken up by his followers and which
            formed the basis for modern healthcare. Galen, the Greek physician,
            provided a method of understanding – however imprecise – that
            allowed interaction of flesh and spirit through the maintenance of
            internal harmony.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The medievalists, on the brink of scientific thought, stressed
            knowledge of the body as the first exercise in treating disease.
            Skill with their hands – the newfound art of surgery – largely
            replaced the ineffectual remedies of the day. The Lakota shaman
            Black Elk (1863-1950) showed a different comprehension of illness
            and healing, not scientific nor contemporary but filled with
            invisible spirits and forces that only the chosen few could
            manipulate. We will also examine numerous women healers, including
            psychiatrist Sabina Spielrein (1885-1942), both victim and healer,
            tormented by childhood traumas lodged deep in her subconscious that
            stimulated an interest in understanding and healing others afflicted
            with disorders of the mind, often as severe and disabling as those
            of physical natures.

            This history of healers is not comprehensive; it is illustrative. It
            is not exhaustive; it is instructional.

              >Everyone faces existential threats to health and wellness at some
              point in their lives. The frightful prospect of suffering and
              death, in the moment, is terrifying. Is science enough? Very often
              the answer is no. Advances in medicine and surgery have no doubt
              substantially contributed to the process of recovery, in fact
              painful and debilitating treatments may be necessary to achieve
              healing. Yet, there must be more. History has provided some
              insight to the arduous, metaphysical, and religious journey of
              reconciliation and resignation. This book will illuminate pivotal
              figures who provided not only the physical but also the
              metaphysical elements of therapy for those sufferers facing
              tormented and abbreviated futures. There is wisdom in this
              history, as spiritual equanimity is timeless and science remains
              imperfect. It is an inner, spiritual peace that humankind truly
              pursues. Reconciliation with illness and disease can only come by
              finding and embracing that peace. <i>The Healers </i>illustrates
              those variegated and multicultural attempts to seek holistic
              health.
