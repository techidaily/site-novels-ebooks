            <span>In </span>Mirari<span>, Mari Perron, who received </span>A
            Course of Love<span>
              twenty years ago, enters an intimate exchange with Mary of
              Nazareth. This dialogue gives life to "the way of Mary," briefly
              introduced in her earlier work. In this new book, Perron departs
              from its classic style and surprises us with her own
              vulnerability.</span

          <p>
            <span>Here, the two women follow </span>A Course of Love<span
              >'s call for "creation of the new" with the labor of the birth and
              the "Mother laws of care and nurture-given to all." Together, they
              demonstrate the radical energy that arises from within each one's
              sacred heart, and how, from our union in relationship, we know
              that the time is here to give birth to a new age.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <span
              >Mary of Nazareth was not unfamiliar with this call or the grief
              that accompanied it. Her life, as well as the life of Jesus,
              announced an unwelcome breach in the old order. So too is it with </span
            >A Course of Love<span>
              and the new Way of the Marys. Mari Perron shares her personal
              experience of receiving </span
            >A Course of Love<span>
              and feeling unseen or as a mere vessel for its "learned wisdom."
              Her call to devotion and to the "unlearning" that is key to a new
              way of knowing, was heard by few. Mary and Mari assure us that it
              is from a feminine way of knowing-deeper than thought, and
              impossible to "learn"-that The New will arise.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <span
              >As both women share their deepest grief, they gather readers
              close, nudging each of us to recognize and share our grief. This
              courageous act is prerequisite to healing our own and the
              collective feminine wound. Healing opens the way to unifying the
              feminine and masculine within, and the birth of an age that will
              end all such divisions. They invite us to rise up and join in the
              blossoming of the New Advent. We claim our time of Mirari: the
              wonder of coming to know the unknown that is our inheritance. In
              this radical new feminine way, we welcome receptive revelation
              that does not take us away from life or the personal milieu in
              which it occurs. Instead, it joins them fully.</span

            <span
              >Mari Perron knows that it is time for the feminine voice of God
              and of women to be recognized as a power that has always been-but
              been denied. Mari's aspiration to be a writer was overcome by her
              call to be a spiritual pioneer. Increasingly, she is a champion of
              the ways, often discounted, in which women come to know. Her work
              is alive with soul and depth and longing and a vision that will
              mid-wife the birth of The New.</span

            We begin with a word both new and ancient. We begin with a return to
            the way of the Word made flesh. This will be the time of wonder-or
            Mirari.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Here, in our time of bringing the miracle to mystery . . . we offer
            Mirari as the way of the divine feminine . . .

          <p>
            This is not the masculine energy of going out to conquer the world.
            This is the birth of the new world.
