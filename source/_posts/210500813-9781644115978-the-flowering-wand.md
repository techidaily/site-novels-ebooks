            >A deep exploration of the regenerative and magical secrets of
            sacred masculinity hidden in familiar myths both ancient and
            modern</b
          ><br /><br />• Reveals the restorative fungi archetype of Osiris, the
          Orphic mysteries as an underground mycelium linking forests and
          people, how Dionysus teaches us about invasive species and playful
          sexuality, and the ecology of Jesus as depicted in his nature-focused
          parables<br /><br />• Liberates Tristan, Merlin, and the Grail legends
          from the bounds of Campbell’s hero’s journey and invites the masculine
          into more nuanced, complex ways of dealing with trauma, growth, and
          self-knowledge<br /><br />Long before the sword-wielding heroes of
          legend readily cut down forests, slaughtered the old deities, and
          vanquished their enemies, there were playful gods, animal-headed
          kings, mischievous lovers, trickster harpists, and vegetal magicians
          with flowering wands. As eco-feminist scholar Sophie Strand
          discovered, these wilder, more magical modes of the masculine have
          always been hidden in plain sight. <br /><br />Sharing the culmination
          of eight years of research into myth, folklore, and the history of
          religion, Strand leads us back into the forgotten landscapes and
          hidden secrets of familiar myths, revealing the beautiful range of the
          divine masculine, including expressions of male friendship, male
          intimacy, and male creative collaboration. In discussing Dionysus and
          Osiris, Strand encourages us to think like an ecosystem instead of
          like an individual. She connects dying, vegetal gods to the virtuous
          cycle of composting and decay, highlighting the ways in which
          mushrooms can restore soil and heal polluted landscapes. Exploring
          esoteric Christianity, the author celebrates the Gnostic Jesus of the
          Gospel of Thomas, imagining the ecology that the Rabbi Yeshua would
          have actually been referencing in his nature-focused parables. Strand
          frees Tristan, Merlin, and the Grail legends from the bounds of
          Campbell’s hero’s journey and invites the masculine into more nuanced,
          complex ways of dealing with trauma, growth, and self-knowledge.
          <br /><br />Strand reseeds our minds with new visions of male identity
          and shows how each of us, regardless of gender, can develop a matured
          ecological empathy and witness a blossoming of sacred masculine powers
          that are soft, curious, connective, and celebratory.

          “Sophie Strand’s words embody both the chthonic depth of
          well-myceliated soil and the crystals, sharp with insight, among its
          hyphae. In <i>The Flowering Wand</i>, Sophie remediates the ground of
          western culture by rerooting the divine masculine--in all its
          fertility, magic and imagination-- back into the earth. Through
          Sophie‘s richly seeded prose and deep scholarship she shows us how
          reclaiming this fertile, soporific energy--an energy that lives within
          us all--can help heal our connection with the Animate Everything and
          nourish the re-flowering of the world.”
