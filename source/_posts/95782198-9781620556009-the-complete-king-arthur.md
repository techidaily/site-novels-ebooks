          A comprehensive examination of the historical and mythological
          evidence for every major theory about King Arthur<br /><br />•
          Explores the history of every Arthur candidate and the geographical
          arguments that have placed him in different locations<br /><br />•
          Examines 1,800 years of evidence for Arthur’s life and the famous
          series of 12 battles fought against the Saxons in the 6th century<br /><br />•
          Reconstructs the history of the 6th century in Britain, when the first
          references to Arthur and the core events of his reign appear<br /><br />Few
          legends have had the enduring influence of those surrounding King
          Arthur. Many believe the stories are based on historical truth. For
          others Arthur represents the archetype of the brilliant monarch
          reigning over a fairy-tale kingdom, offering his knights the
          opportunity to prove their mettle in battle and find gnostic
          illumination through initiation into sacred mysteries like that of the
          Grail.<br /><br />Presenting the culmination of more than 40 years’
          research, John and Caitlín Matthews examine the historical and
          mythological evidence for every major theory about the existence of
          King Arthur. Drawing on modern techniques in archaeology and
          scholarship, they reconstruct the history of the 6th century in
          Britain, the period when the first unambiguous references to Arthur
          appear. They explore the history of every Arthur candidate, the
          geographical arguments that have placed him in different locations,
          and the evidence for his life and famous battles fought against the
          Saxons. Was the greatest British hero of all time not a king but a
          2nd-century Roman officer active around Hadrian’s Wall in Cumbria? A
          5th-century soldier who operated in areas as far apart as Cornwall,
          Wales, Scotland, or Brittany? Or an entirely mythical fiction that
          provided a figure of light during a dark period of British history?<br /><br />Examining
          other literary figures from the 5th century such as Vortigern and
          Ambrosius, the authors also break down the plots of all the major
          Arthurian romances, including those by Chretien de Troyes, Sir Thomas
          Malory, and Robert de Boron, to reveal the historical events they are
          based on. Piecing together the many fragments that constitute the
          image of Arthur, both the man and the myth, the authors show how each
          face of Arthur has something to offer and how his modern popularity
          proves the enduring power of the hero-myth, truly earning Arthur the
          title he first received in the 15th century: The Once and Future King.

          "Certain figures of myth and history have an ability to touch us
          deeply and take up residence in our imaginations, becoming a
          touchstone for inspiration and inner power. King Arthur is one of
          these. Whatever his historical veracity may be, he is a cultural icon
          that has lived through the centuries and continues to influence us in
          many ways today. In this book, John and Caitlin Matthews bring the
          importance of this figure to vibrant life. Far more than simply
          retelling familiar tales, they go deep into the spiritual, historical,
          literary, artistic, and mythic heart of Arthur to demonstrate most
          eloquently the wide reach of his cultural influence and why he
          continues to be the once and future king of our hopes and our
          imaginations."
