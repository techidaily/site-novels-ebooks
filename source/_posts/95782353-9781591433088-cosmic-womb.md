          Compelling evidence that life, intelligence, and evolution on Earth
          were seeded by comets and cosmic intelligence <br /><br />• Explains
          how life first came from interstellar dust and comets and how later
          arrivals of cosmic dust and comets spurred evolution <br /><br />•
          Explores the possibility that universal knowledge may be stored in
          human DNA and how ancient cultures may have known a way to retrieve
          this knowledge <br /><br />• Reveals new discoveries about the
          dimensions of the Great Pyramid of Giza <br /><br />All ancient
          cultures link humanity’s origins to the heavens. The Egyptians, for
          example, were adamant that their ancestors came from the stars of
          Orion and Sirius. Today, however, religion and science assert that
          life arose spontaneously here on Earth. Did the ancients know our true
          cosmic origins? Have they left us clues? <br /><br />Expanding on the
          panspermia theory developed with the celebrated astronomer Sir Fred
          Hoyle--namely that the building blocks of life were imported to Earth
          by comets in the distant past--Chandra Wickramasinghe and Robert
          Bauval explore the latest findings in support of a cosmic origin for
          humanity. They detail the astrobiological discoveries of organic
          molecules deep in space, how microbes are incredibly resistant to the
          harshest conditions of space--enabling the transfer of genes from one
          star system to another, and the recent recovery of microorganisms from
          comets still in space. They argue that the universe was “born” and
          preset with the blueprint of life and that the cosmos must be teeming
          with lifeforms far older and perhaps far more developed than us. They
          show how life arrived on our planet in the form of interstellar dust
          containing alien bacteria approximately 3.8 billion years ago and how
          later comets, meteoroids, and asteroids brought new bacterial and
          viral genetic material, which was vital for evolution.
          <br /><br />Using the latest advances in physics, cosmology, and
          neuroscience, the authors explore how universal knowledge may be
          stored in human DNA and cells, and they postulate that ancient
          cultures, such as the pyramid builders of Egypt and the temple
          builders of India, may have known a way to retrieve this knowledge.
          Sharing new discoveries from experienced architects, engineers, and
          mathematicians, they show how the Great Pyramid is a three-dimensional
          mathematical equation in stone, bearing a potent message for humanity
          across time and space about who we are and where we come from.

          “Chandra Wickramasinghe, Ph.D., starts off by inviting us to join him
          on his journey as a scientist searching for the origins of life on our
          planet. His passion for the topic and his joy with each new discovery
          are contagious and spellbinding. Then Robert Bauval continues the
          journey by bringing fresh insights into the Giza pyramid complex as he
          did in his bestselling book <i>The Orion Mystery</i>.”
