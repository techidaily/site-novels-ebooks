            Identity is one of the most controversial topics discussed in our
            world today. There are many competing factors that try to define
            what a person is or is not, who they should be or not be, and who
            gets the final say on how they will be perceived.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            We already have too many copycats, imitators, and lost individuals
            who do not understand who they are or how they fit it into the piece
            of the human puzzle. They often end up in places that they didn't
            imagine, settling in jobs or careers that they hate, in
            relationships that drain them, or are simply trying to find their
            way back to being who they were always meant to be. It doesn't help
            that we live in a social mediaâ€“driven culture where many are so
            focused on what society says is the norm that we forget to be
            original and authentic.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            No one should be trying to force-fit into a place they were never
            intended to remain. Although all of us have made mistakes that have
            tried to define us, have felt lost or confused at some point in our
            life journey, and have been forced to make hard decisions in the
            midst of pain, none of these things have the final say on who we
            really are.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Life has a way of snuffing out true passion, shutting down dreams,
            and altering the lens in which we view the world. Pieces:
            Constructing the Identity Puzzle; A Christian Perspective is a book
            that details the journey of uncovering your unique identity while
            seeking to understand God in the midst of your flaws and
            imperfections.
          </p>
          <p></p>

            Through poetry, anecdotes, and practical wisdom, Powell explains the
            ways in which a person who once felt uncertain, robbed, lost, and
            defeated can recover and emerge victorious. This book challenges you
            to reflect on the things that prevent you from being truly authentic
            while exploring the process of uncovering the layers that make you
            "you!" Finally, it asks you the most important question of all: "who
            are you really?"
