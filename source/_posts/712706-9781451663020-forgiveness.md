            >With this guidebook in hand, anyone can embrace the power of
            forgiveness and transform their life and relationships.</b
          ><br /><br />Discover the power of forgiveness—what it can do for you,
          right now. As the title suggests, <i>Forgiveness</i> shows you how to
          take the steps to let go of your anger and your grudges and truly
          forgive those you have wronged you in some way—and, maybe more
          importantly, how to forgive yourself. Healing and acceptance are on
          the horizon, and with this book, you can learn about the toxic,
          negative side effects of staying angry and hurt and how we can benefit
          both physically and mentally from the event of forgiving others and
          ourselves.<br />
          <br />Teaching practical spirituality and written in very simple,
          easy-to-understand language, readers of <i>Forgiveness</i> will learn
          the top twenty reasons why the path to forgiveness has so many
          obstacles and how to remove those obstacles to create miracles in
          their lives and those of others. If you ready to forgive and finally
          live a life full of joy and contentment but are not sure where to
          begin, then this book is for you.

          "What I've noticed in my life is that is has been easier to talk about
          forgiveness than to practice it. That's why Jerry's book is so
          important to me. I am glad to learn more about this miracle tool and
          the miracles it can produce. I am so happy to learn how to use it, not
          just talk about it. . . . This book is Jerry's truth, but it is God's
          message. . . . So be very clear that, as you read this book, you are
          having a conversation with God. And be very sure that you are not
          having it by accident." -- from the foreword by Neale Donald Walsch,
          author of <i>Conversations with God</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          The late Gerald G. Jampolsky, MD, author of
          <i>Forgiveness: The Greatest Healer of All</i>, was an internationally
          recognized authority in the fields of psychiatry, health, business,
          and education. Jampolsky was a child and adult psychiatrist, a
          graduate of Stanford Medical School, an author, and an inspirational
          speaker. He learned about forgiveness by helping thousands of people
          for more than thirty years deal with the psychological, social, and
          spiritual aspects of facing both chronic and life-threatening
          illnesses. He was the founder of The Center for Attitudinal Healing,
          of which there are now more than 130 satellite centers around the
          world, and was the recipient of the Jehan Sadat Peace Award.
          Jampolsky’s pioneering work at the center eventually led him to
          consult in Bosnia, Russia, and Ghana on the importance of attitudinal
          healing and forgiveness. Jampolsky is the author of numerous
          bestselling books, including
          <i>Love Is&nbsp;Letting Go of Fear</i> (with over 3.5 million copies
          in print).<br />
          <br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Neale Donald Walsch devotes his time to
          sharing the messages of his books through writing, lecturing, and
          facilitating spiritual renewal retreats. The creator of the School of
          the New Spirituality and founder of The Group of 1000, a nonprofit
          organization supporting global spiritual awakening, he lives in
          Ashland, Oregon, and may be contacted through NealeDonaldWalsch.com.
