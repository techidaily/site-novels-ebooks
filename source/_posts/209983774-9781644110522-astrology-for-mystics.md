          A guide to discovering and developing the spiritual and mystical
          talents hidden in your astrological chart <br /><br />• Explores the
          4th, 8th, and 12th houses of the natal astrological chart—those
          connected with the water signs, the deepest and darkest areas of the
          individual psyche, profound spiritual insights, and hidden knowledge
          <br /><br />• Explains how to interpret the signs and planets in the
          water houses of your birth chart, including how to develop the innate
          talents and spiritual powers you discover <br /><br />• Reveals the
          occult and psychic significance of water and shows how this
          significance is expressed in each of the three water signs: Cancer,
          Scorpio, and Pisces, the rulers of the water houses <br /><br />Your
          astrological birth chart, or natal chart, shows the positions of the
          planets, sun, and moon at the time of your birth. Shaped like a circle
          or wheel, it is divided into 12 sections, or “houses,” each connected
          with a different area of life or self. The positions of the planets
          within the houses offer deep and often complex insight into your
          unique gifts and your life’s path. <br /><br />In
          <i>Astrology for Mystics</i>, Tayannah Lee McQuillar explores the 4th,
          8th, and 12th houses--those connected with the element of water and
          all things occult, mystical, and spiritual. The fourth house, ruled by
          water sign Cancer, is traditionally the house of family, home,
          ancestors, and suffering. The eighth house, ruled by water sign
          Scorpio, is the house of sex, death, secret powers, and
          transformation. The twelfth house, ruled by Pisces, is the house of
          karma, loss, unspoken expectations, fantasy, and confinement. As
          McQuillar explains, these are the houses that reveal the deepest and
          darkest areas of the individual psyche, which many people are
          reluctant to explore, yet this triad is the key to profound spiritual
          insights as well as the discovery of hidden knowledge and abilities.
          <br /><br />The author guides you through interpreting the signs and
          planets that inhabit the water houses in your natal chart and shows
          how they reveal specific innate talents. She describes how to develop
          the hidden powers revealed by your chart and offers practical advice
          for incorporating this knowledge into your daily life for spiritual
          growth and self-improvement. Sharing interpretation examples from her
          practice, she also explores how to embrace the challenge of the occult
          water houses so you can claim the many treasures that can only be
          found on the ocean floor of the psyche.

          "I highly recommend <i>Astrology for Mystics</i> for those who want a
          guide for navigating the watery realms of their chart. For
          astrological novice, this can be a wonderful book to tap into the
          uncharted energy of the 4th, 8th, and 12th house in their chart. Those
          with advanced knowledge in astrology are sure to discover something
          new as well since McQuillar offers her own insight, which is soulful
          and poignant. It can be so very nice to have a “hand to hold” or a
          book to anchor us as we take the plunge into the occult depths of our
          natal charts, and McQuillar perfectly holds that space for us."
