          <b>A WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER by DR. JOE DISPENZA , </b>the
          author of the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
          <i>You Are the Placebo</i>, as well as
          <i>Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself</i> and
          <i>Evolve Your Brain.<br /><b></b></i><br />
          <i>Becoming Supernatural </i>draws on epigenetics, quantum physics
          &amp; neuroscience research conducted at his advanced workshops since
          2012 to explore how common people are doing the uncommon to transform
          their consciousness, mindset, and beliefs to heal and live
          SUPERNATURAL lives.<br /><br />
          <i>Becoming Supernatural</i> marries some of the most profound
          scientific information with ancient spiritual wisdom to show how
          people like you and me can experience a more mystical life.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Readers will learn that we are, quite literally supernatural by nature
          if given the proper knowledge and instruction, and when we learn how
          to apply that information through various healing meditations, we
          should experience a greater expression of our creative abilities.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          We have the capacity to tune in to frequencies beyond our material
          world and receive more orderly coherent streams of consciousness and
          energy; that we can intentionally<b></b>change our brain chemistry to
          initiate profoundly mystical transcendental experiences; and how, if
          we do this enough times, we can develop the skill of creating a more
          efficient, balanced, healthy body, a more unlimited mind, and greater
          access to the quantum field and the realms of spiritual truth.<br /><br />
          Topics include:<br />
          • Demystifying the body’s 7 energy centers and how you can balance
          them to heal<br />
          • How to free yourself from the past by reconditioning your body to a
          new mind<br />
          • How you can create reality in the generous present moment by
          changing your energy<br />
          • The difference between third-dimension creation and fifth-dimension
          creation<br />
          • The secret science of the pineal gland and its role in accessing
          mystical realms of reality<br />
          • The distinction between Space-Time vs. Time-Space realities<br />
          • And much more<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Chapters Include:<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Opening the Door to the Supernatural<br />
          The Present Moment<br />
          Tuning In to New Potentials in the Quantum<br />
          Blessing of the Energy Centers<br />
          Reconditioning the Body to a New Mind<br />
          Case Studies: Living Examples of Truth<br />

          The Pineal Gland<br />
          Project Coherence: Making a Better World<br />
          Case Studies: It Could Happen to You<br /><br />Using tools and
          disciplines ranging from cutting-edge physics to practical exercises
          such as a walking meditation, Dr. Joe offers nothing less than a
          proven program for stepping outside our physical reality and into the
          quantum field of infinite possibilities.<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dr. Joe Dispenza first caught the public’s eye as one of the
          scientists featured in the award-winning film What the BLEEP Do We
          Know!? Since then, his work has expanded in several key directions
          that reflect his passion for exploring how people can use findings
          from neuroscience and quantum physics not only to heal illness but
          also to enjoy a more fulfilled and happy life. Dr. Joe is driven by
          the conviction that each one of us has the potential for greatness and
          unlimited abilities.As a scientist, teacher and lecturer, Dr. Joe has
          educated thousands of people in how they can re-wire their brains and
          re-condition their bodies to make lasting changes. As a researcher, he
          explores the science behind spontaneous remissions and how people heal
          themselves of chronic conditions and even terminal diseases. He has
          been partnering with other scientists to research the effects of
          meditation during his advanced workshops, using techniques from brain
          mapping with EEGs to measuring heart coherence to demonstrating
          verifiable epigenetic changes in his students. He is also currently
          measuring telomere changes as well as 7,500 gene regulations in this
          research with advanced participants too. As a corporate consultant,
          Dr. Joe gives on-site lectures and workshops for businesses and
          corporations interested in using neuroscientific principles to boost
          their employees’ creativity, innovation, productivity, and more. He is
          the author of the New York Timesbestseller You Are the Placebo: Making
          Your Mind Matter as well as Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself and
          Evolve Your Brain. Website: drjoedispenza.com
