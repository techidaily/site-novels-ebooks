              >The spirits of Harriet Tubman, John Brown, and other heroes of
              the Underground Railroad guide readers on a magical path to
              healing, empowerment, and liberation.</b
            ><br /><br />
            The historical role that magic and soothsaying played in the
            Underground Railroad has long been ignored out of fear it might
            diminish the legacy of Harriet Tubman and other heroes of that time.
            &nbsp;However, Harriet Tubman was a Conjure woman who relied on her
            dreams and visionary experiences to lead her followers to freedom.
            Revered as “Mama Moses,” she, along with John Brown, Mary Ellen
            Pleasant, and others have been venerated since their deaths. They
            now have emerged in the 21st century as the pantheon of a new and
            increasingly popular African-Diaspora tradition.<br /><br />
            Written by Witchdoctor Utu, founder of the Niagara Voodoo Shrine,
            this is the first book devoted to the spiritual and magical
            tradition of the Underground Railroad. In it, the author conjures
            the spirits of the Underground Railroad, their continued connection
            to each other, and their “tracks” still leading to freedom from
            obstacles, bondage, and trouble and tribulations of all kinds. It is
            a spiritual tradition that is broadly accessible and inclusive, much
            like the historical Underground Railroad itself, whose participants
            were black, white, and Native American, male and female, Christians,
            Jews, Quakers, animists, secret devotees of forbidden African
            religions, and free thinkers of all kinds.<br /><br />
            This revelatory book teaches readers how to invoke the blessings of
            Mama Moses and her followers, access their healing inspiration and
            magic powers, and seek their own path to freedom.

          "Presented in an engaging manner, Witchdoctor Utu’s impressive new
          book,
          <i
            >Conjuring Harriet "Mama Moses" Tubman and the Spirits of the
            Underground Railroad</i
          >, is an exercise not only in the spiritual elevation of heroic
          ancestors, but also in the elevation of everyone who values and fights
          for freedom from enslavement. Utu asks us to put aside for a moment
          the usual history and understanding of the legendary fugitive slave
          turned conductor of the Underground Railroad and to focus on the
          empowering spiritual beliefs held by abolitionists and freedom seekers
          that played a vital role in their journeys to freedom. More than a
          grimoire of conjures, Witchdoctor Utu shares the rarely told stories
          of those who followed the North Star to freedom from the antebellum
          South to St. Catherines, Ontario, protective roots in hand. He brings
          to light a powerful Conjure tradition that, with a cairn and cross,
          guides the spiritual seeker towards a meaningful way to honor Mama
          Moses and the spirits of the Underground Railroad, and revere the
          bones of those still lying in unmarked graves." –<b
