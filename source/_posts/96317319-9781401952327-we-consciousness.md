            >After best-selling author Dr. Wayne W. Dyer left the physical plane
            in 2015, psychic medium Karen Noé began receiving very profound and
            specific messages from him for his family—and for the world. </b
          ><br /><br />While Wayne comes through to Karen singularly, he also
          comes through together with a group of other celestial beings called
          the We Guides, which includes Saint Francis of Assisi and countless
          other angels and ascended masters.<br /><br />Wayne and the We Guides
          share 33 concepts that make up the We Consciousness —and they all
          point toward your becoming an instrument of peace. In order to extend
          peace outside of yourself, you must first feel peace within yourself.
          You must expect to see peace everywhere, and acknowledge the infinite
          peace that you are. Then you must live that identity to the
          fullest.<br /><br />After understanding and applying these ideas, you
          will be able to create miracles in your life and the lives of others
          as well. You’ll learn how to create heaven right here on earth.

          "We Consciousness shows us how to undo the optical delusion of
          separation—which is the primary cause of all lack and suffering—and
          thereby help the world evolve in the direction of love. I recommend it
          wholeheartedly."<br />— Robert Holden, author of Loveability and
          co-author with Louise Hay of Life Loves You<br /><br />"Renowned
          psychic medium Karen Noé has the profound ability to communicate with
          the deceased. In this awe-inspiring book, We Consciousness, Karen
          discusses philosophical truths that she has received from the late
          Wayne Dyer, ascended masters, angels, and celestial beings. Filled
          with spiritual insights, this book will reveal powerful principles
          that will transform your life as you embark on this soulful path to a
          more peaceful and joyous life."<br />— Anita Moorjani, New York Times
          best-selling author of Dying to Be Me and What If This Is Heaven<br /><br />"When
          we lost Dr. Wayne Dyer in August of 2015, I was sad for myself for
          losing a friend and teacher, and also for the world for losing such a
          powerful voice. I mourned the fact that we wouldn’t hear Dr. Dyer’s
          wisdom and messages of hope at a time when we so badly need them. Then
          I read Karen Noe’s book, We Consciousness, and I was comforted by
          reading the 33 messages of love and compassion she shares. When I
          closed my eyes, I could hear Dr. Dyer’s voice as clearly as I did on
          his weekly radio show. I can rest assured that we can still count on
          Dr. Dyer’s wisdom as relayed through Karen’s gift of mediumship. Thank
          you, Karen, for sharing with us these simple and powerful truths and
          reminding us that our loved ones are just a thought away."<br />—
          Diane Ray, director of programming, Unity Media Network, and former
          co-host with Dr. Wayne Dyer on his weekly Hay House Radio show<br /><br />?"I
          had the great pleasure of meeting Karen Noé several years back, and I
          instantly liked her. What struck me about her was how incredibly
          humble and genuine she was—despite the fact that her ability to
          communicate with the world of spirit was up there with the best! In
          this new book, We Consciousness, Karen takes this to an even higher
          level by not only bringing through the messages of Wayne Dyer, but
          also channeling the 33 most important truths that he, St. Francis, and
          a litany of other wonderful guides and angels bring forth! In my work
          with the Angel Margaret, she has often spoken of the fact that we are
          all one and that we share the same consciousness; the more we come to
          understand the truths of that connection, the greater the chance we
          have to create heaven on earth. This book may well be the first step
          on that wonderful journey!"<br />— Gerry Gavin, author of Messages
          from Margaret and If You Could Talk to an Angel<br /><br />"Karen Noé,
          the internationally celebrated psychic medium and author, has penned a
          spiritual masterpiece with her new book, We Consciousness, which
          behooves all humans to embrace love, compassion, and forgiveness for
          all humans, Mother Earth, and all the creatures who share our planet.
          Ms. Noé, who channels wisdom from Dr. Wayne Dyer, St. Francis of
          Assisi, ascended masters, and other wise spirits, provides the reader
          with 33 profound truths that will open the door to the peace, harmony,
          and happiness we all yearn for our planet. She makes it clear that it
          is incumbent on us all to follow these truths to expand our
          consciousness, raise our vibrations, and become beacons of light for
          others to follow. This book is a must-read for those who want to
          transform our planet into a warm and loving home for all its
          inhabitants."<br />— Garnet Schulhauser, best-selling author of
          Dancing on a Stamp, Dancing Forever with Spirit, Dance of Heavenly
          Bliss, and Dance of Eternal Rapture?<br /><br />"As this beautiful
          book expertly illustrates, in order to experience peace and love
          within, we have to express it without. Love is the essence of the
          soul. This is part of the reason why I felt so instantly drawn to
          Karen Noé. Karen doesn’t just talk about the importance of being an
          instrument of peace in this world; she is that peace. She doesn’t just
          talk about the importance of giving and expressing love for others;
          she is that love. True, Karen is a gifted psychic medium, but more
          importantly, she is a caring, kind, loving person who truly wants to
          help others. She is a blessing beyond words to me and so many. As you
          read We Consciousness and the 33 profound truths brought through by
          the late Wayne Dyer and others in the celestial realm, prepare to be
          inspired and transformed."<br />— Josie Varga, author of Visits from
          Heaven, Divine Visits, and A Call from Heaven: Personal Accounts of
          Deathbed Visits, Angelic Visions and Crossings to the Other Side<br /><br />?"I
          am blessed to have worked with Karen Noé for a number of years and
          have always been struck by her professionalism, her sensitivity, her
          insight, and her profound wisdom. On a personal note, my family and I
          have also been the recipients of her spiritual gifts. Through profound
          tragedy, Karen helped all of us understand that our loved ones never
          leave us and that their light shines through even our darkest storms.
          I am abundantly grateful for Karen’s presence in our lives . . . And
          once you read We Consciousness, you will be as well."<br />— Carole
          Brody Fleet, author of Widows Wear Stilettos and Loss Is a Four-Letter
          Word<br /><br />"We met Karen in person at a time of tremendous grief.
          Our husband and father, Dr. Wayne Dyer, had just recently crossed
          over, and we were feeling the enormous weight of that loss. Karen came
          into our lives, and from that moment on, each of us knew that our
          father was still with us. She has been an angel to all of us during
          these first few months of losing our dad, and her presence in our
          lives has been a gift we feel our dad orchestrated from the other
          side. Karen has the gift of talking to the angels and to loved ones
          who have passed, and her messages from our dad are so specific that we
          knew they could only be coming from him. Karen has given us the
          greatest gift during the first year of processing our loss; she has
          given us the knowing that someone who loves you never, ever leaves
          you. The comfort we have received from our time and conversations with
          Karen is indescribable. At times it felt as though we were actually
          sitting there talking to our father and husband. We, as a family, have
          come to know Karen and to love her."<br />— The Dyer Family<br /><br />"Karen
          Noé has a profound gift that she shares with the world, and this new
          book is more of her allowing us to witness her own desire to serve
          others. She is a blessing."<br />— Marcelene Dyer, Wayne’s wife<br /><br />"Karen
          Noé has proven to be a complete godsend to our family. . . . The
          timing and intensity of the messages are truly a gift from God, and I
          am forever grateful to have Karen Noé and her amazing gifts in my
          life."<br />— Tracy Dyer, Wayne’s daughter<br /><br />"Karen Noé is
          such a gift, and she has helped countless people learn how to heal and
          understand what happens after someone leaves us. I am forever grateful
          to her."<br />— Skye Dyer, Wayne’s daughter<br /><br />"Karen Noé is
          the real deal. Her gift has singularly changed my perception of life
          after death. . . . Karen has opened my heart and given me the gift of
          knowing that our loved ones are still with us, even after they die.
          For that I will be forever grateful."<br />— Sommer Wayne Dyer Camp,
          Wayne’s daughter<br /><br />"Karen’s ability to communicate on behalf
          of my dad is truly astounding. I am so grateful that my dad placed her
          in our lives. She is a blessing to the entire Dyer family."<br />—
          Serena Dyer, Wayne’s daughter<br /><br />"This message from my father,
          through Karen Noé, allowed me to stay confident in the direction of my
          dreams, and brought me deep peace just at the moment when I needed it
          the most."<br />— Sands Dyer, Wayne’s son <br /><br />?"Karen Noé has
          been an immeasurable guide in helping me learn to hear and feel my dad
          from the other side. She has given my family and myself messages from
          my dad that are intensely personal and precise. I know without a doubt
          that Karen is communicating with my dad."<br />— Saje Dyer, Wayne’s
          daughter
