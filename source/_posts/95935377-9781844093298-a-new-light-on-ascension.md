          It has been ten years since Kumeka, Master of the Eighth Ray,
          introduced himself to Diana Cooper and began to meld his consciousness
          with hers.<br /><br /><i>A Little Light on Ascension</i> presented the
          information he impressed on Diana at the time, but since then, much
          has changed on our planet, and Kumeka has recently imparted further
          information. This knowledge, previously offered to just a few, is now
          available to millions of lightworkers eager to assist in the task of
          moving this planet into the light. Yes, ascending into the higher
          realms can be achieved in this lifetime. We may have to work at it,
          but all the tools and information we need are now available to us
          thanks to A New Light on Ascension. However, be prepared, this journey
          is not for the fainthearted! Kumeka does not offer a quick fix; he
          invites and encourages each one of us to join the millions on the
          planet now actively working towards a joyful life of spirit. "Diana
          Cooper's A Little Light on Ascension is the book that reminds me why I
          am here and what it is all about. To say I find it an inspiration is
          an understatement; to describe is as my bible would not be an
          exaggeration." —Susan Clark, The Sunday Times

          Diana Cooper is a lecturer and the principal of the Diana Cooper
          School. She is the author of many books, CDs and card sets, including
          <i>2012 and Beyond</i>, <i>The Keys to the Universe</i>,
          <i>Transition to the Golden Age of 2032</i> and
          <i>The Angels of Light Cards</i>. During a crisis in her life fifteen
          years ago she was taken on an incredible inner journey of the Universe
          by an angelic being. She has since become interested in spirit guides
          learning how to talk to hers and, as she becomes more clairvoyant,
          actually sees them. Richard Crookes has been working as a full time
          freelance artist for nearly 30 years, providing illustrations for the
          publishing industries as well as exhibiting, selling his fine artwork
          and working on commission.
