          New commentaries on Aleister Crowley’s Book of the Law reveal how it
          is connected to both Right- and Left-Hand Paths <br />
          <br />• Examines each line of the Book of the Law in the light of
          modern psychology, Egyptology, Gurdjieff’s teachings, and contemporary
          Left-Hand Path thought <br />
          <br />• Explores Crowley’s identification with the First Beast of
          Revelations as well as his adoption of the Loki archetype for becoming
          a vessel of love for all humanity <br />
          <br />• Recasts the Cairo Working as a text of personal sovereignty
          and a relevant tool for personal transformation <br />
          <br />• Includes commentary on the Book of the Law by Dr. Michael A.
          Aquino, who served as High Priest of the Temple of Set from 1975 to
          1996 <br />
          <br />Received by Aleister Crowley in April 1904 in Cairo, Egypt, the
          Book of the Law is the most provocative record of magical working in
          several hundred years, affecting not only organizations directly
          associated with Crowley such as the Ordo Templi Orientis but also
          modern Wicca, Chaos Magic, and the Temple of Set. <br />
          <br />Boldly defying Crowley’s warning not to comment on the Book of
          the Law, Ipsissimus Don Webb provides in-depth interpretation from
          both Black and White Magical perspectives, including commentary from
          Dr. Michael A. Aquino, who served as High Priest of the Temple of Set
          from 1975 to 1996. Webb examines each line of the Book in the light of
          modern psychology, Egyptology, existentialism, and competing occult
          systems such as the teachings of G. I. Gurdjieff and contemporary
          Left-Hand Path thought. Discarding the common image of Crowley
          formulated in a spiritually unsophisticated time when the devotee of
          the Left-Hand Path was dismissed as a selfish evil doer, Webb unveils
          a new side of Crowley based on his adoption of the Loki archetype and
          his aim to become a vessel of love for all humanity. In so doing, he
          shows how the Book of the Law is connected to both Right- and
          Left-Hand Paths and reveals how Crowley’s magical path of mastery over
          the self and Cosmos overthrew the gods of old religion, which had kept
          humanity asleep to dream the nightmare of history. <br />
          <br />Providing in-depth analysis of Crowley’s sources and his
          self-identification with the First Beast of Revelation from a profound
          esoteric perspective, Webb takes his views out of the Golden Dawn
          matrix within which he received the Book of the Law and radically
          recasts the Cairo Working as a text of personal sovereignty and a
          relevant tool for personal transformation.

          "Aleister Crowley wrote many works himself, and many works have been
          written about him. Most of the latter focus on his colorful lifestyle,
          while others seek to interpret his meta-poetic words in terms of one
          or another Thelemite orthodoxy. In this volume, Don Webb goes beyond
          either of these approaches. Webb, who made his way along the same
          arduous initiatory pathways pioneered by the First Beast, here focuses
          on the initiatory and philosophical meanings of Crowley’s life work.
          He does so in a way that can be of personal magical benefit to all who
          read the book."
