          “Probably you believe you are a person reading these very words right
          now. Maybe you also see yourself as a spiritual seeker. You've been to
          sacred places, followed yoga or meditation, maybe you've been involved
          in a group of seekers with similar interests. Probably you've invested
          a lot in this search for the ultimate truth. Maybe you feel you have
          been close to finding your true nature, and still ... something is
          lacking. What if this search leads you nowhere because the seeker who
          wants to achieve ‘it’ is itself a concept? Have you ever investigated
          the existence of the investigator you believe you are? The seeker you
          believe yourself to be will not like this book. Seekers do not want to
          learn that that their search for enlightenment is just a game of their
          ego. They don't like to see that their spiritual enquiry is endless
          and that their goal of finding their ‘true nature’ is a myth.” Jan
          Kersschot graduated in medicine from Antwerp University, Belgium. His
          lifelong quest for the ultimate truth was characterized by his
          interest in a wisdom which does not exclude anything or anyone.
          Blending the core of Eastern wisdom with a contemporary Western
          lifestyle, Jan shows in this collection of extraordinary dialogues how
          the popular myths about self inquiry and enlightenment can be
          unmasked. He is the author of the books, <i>Coming Home</i>,
          <i>Nobody Home</i> and <i>This Is It</i>.
