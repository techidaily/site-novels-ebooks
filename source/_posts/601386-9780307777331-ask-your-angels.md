          Angels have been with us in every time and culture, and in many
          religious traditions. <i>Ask Your Angels</i>&nbsp;vividly chronicles
          how they are currently reaching out to every one of us in a totally
          new way, bridging our physical reality with their pure spiritual
          energy. From historical writings and widespread contemporary
          experience that includes their own workshops, the authors show us how
          we can draw on the power of angels to reconnect with our lost inner
          selves and to achieve our goals, whether they be better relationships,
          healing an illness, or recovery from addiction<br /><br />To align
          with the angelic energy field, you will use five simple steps, as well
          as exercises, meditations, and visualizations, to learn how to talk
          with your angels—in your mind, in letters, in dreams, on a
          computer—and ask their guidance in matters from the inspired to the
          mundane.<br /><br />From Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, and Uriel to the
          angels of birth and death, from the Earth Angel to the guardian or
          companion angel who is your personal teacher, comforter, and intimate
          friend, this guide will introduce you to humor, wisdom, and
          companionship that come from contact with angels, for they are a
          doorway to the Divine within us.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Alma Daniel </b>is an internationally-known spiritual teacher,
          author, and speaker. In 1996 she was ordained as an interfaith
          minister. A healing practitioner for 30 years, Reverend Daniel brings
          her empathic gifts and extensive counseling experience to create

          commitment ceremonies,&nbsp; renewal of vows, memorial services, and
          the naming of babies. Alma continues to accept teaching and speaking
          engagements, both in the US and abroad.<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

          and has a granddaughter, Ruby Hanna. She lives in New York City.<br />

          If you asked him twenty years ago how the angels coming into his life
          would change him, <b>Andrew Ramer </b>would never have
          imagined&nbsp;that they would lead him back to the Judaism of his
          childhood, or deeper into a celebration of the spiritual blessings of
          being a gay man&nbsp;- but that's exactly what&nbsp;happened. He
          continues to talk with the angels, occasionally teaches an angel
          workshop, and is&nbsp;highly active in the LGBT synagogue two blocks
          from his home.&nbsp;Grounded in his Jewish roots,
          he&nbsp;also&nbsp;prays in two local churches, a downtown mosque, and
          maintains the same Buddhist&nbsp;meditation&nbsp;practice he was doing
          when the angels first came to him in 1982. &nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />

          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          <b>Timothy Wyllie</b> was born In England during World War 11 and
          trained as an architect. He practiced in London and the Bahamas before
          joining a religious community and traveling with it throughout Europe
          and the United States. In 1977, he left the community and started a
          small business in New York City marketing his invention of a
          photographic slide storage system to photographers, corporations and
          museums. By 1981 he was able to devote&nbsp;himself&nbsp;full time to
          a study of non-human spiritual intelligences of which he was made
          aware during a Near Death Experience in 1973. His books include
          <i>Dolphins ETs &amp; Angels</i> (1984),
          <i>Adventures Among Spiritual Intelligences</i> (2002), and
          <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels </i>(published in 2011 by Inner
          Traditions/Bear &amp; Co.). His cosmic creation myth
          <i>The Helianx Proposition</i> is published by the Daynal Institute
          Press in 2011), and he is currently co-authoring a seven-volume work:
          <i>The Revelations of a Rebel Angel</i>, which he hopes to complete
          before the end of the world.<br />
