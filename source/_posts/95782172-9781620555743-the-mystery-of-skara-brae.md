          An investigation of the origins of the Neolithic farming village on
          Orkney Island<br /><br />• Reveals the striking similarities between
          Skara Brae and the traditions of pre-dynastic ancient Egypt as
          preserved by the Dogon people of Mali<br /><br />• Explains how
          megalithic stone sites near Skara Brae conform to Dogon cosmology<br /><br />•
          Examines the similarities between Skara Brae and Gobekli Tepe and how
          Skara Brae may have been a secondary center of learning for the
          ancient world<br /><br />In 3200 BC, Orkney Island off the coast of
          Northern Scotland was home to a small farming village called Skara
          Brae. For reasons unknown, after nearly six centuries of continuous
          habitation, the village was abandoned around 2600 BC and its stone
          structures covered over--perhaps deliberately, like the structures at
          Gobekli Tepe. Although now well-excavated, very little is known about
          the peaceful people who lived at Skara Brae or their origins. Who were
          they and where did they go?<br /><br />Drawing on his in-depth
          knowledge of the connections between the cosmology and linguistics of
          Egyptian, Dogon, Chinese, and Vedic traditions, Laird Scranton reveals
          the striking similarities between Skara Brae and the Dogon of Mali,
          who still practice the same cosmology and traditions they once shared
          with pre-dynastic Egypt. He shows how the earliest Skara Brae houses
          match the typical Dogon stone house as well as Schwaller de Lubicz’s
          intrepretation of the Egyptian Temple of Man at Luxor. He explains how
          megalithic stone sites near Skara Brae conform to Dogon cosmology,
          each representing sequential stages of creation as described by Dogon
          priests, and he details how the houses at Skara Brae also represent a
          concept of creation. Citing a linguistic phenomenon known as
          “ultraconserved words,” the author compares words of the Faroese
          language at Skara Brae, a language with no known origin, with
          important cosmological words from Dogon and ancient Egyptian
          traditions, finding obvious connections and similarities.
          <br /><br />Scranton shows how the cultivated field alongside the
          village of Skara Brae corresponds to the “heavenly field” symbolism
          pervasive throughout many ancient cultures, such as the Field of Reeds
          of the ancient Egyptians and the Elysian Fields of ancient Greece. He
          demonstrates how Greek and Egyptian geographic descriptions of these
          fields are a consistent match with Orkney Island. Examining the
          similarities between Skara Brae and Gobekli Tepe, Scranton reveals
          that Skara Brae may have been a secondary center of initiation and
          civilizing knowledge, a long-lost Egyptian mystery school set up
          millennia after Gobekli Tepe was ritually buried, and given the timing
          of the site, is possibly the source of the first pharaohs and priests
          of ancient Egypt.

          “If you are interested in ancient mysteries, then you must read the
          writings of Laird Scranton. . . . <i>The Mystery of Skara Brae</i> is
          a welcome addition to his amazing library of work. Connections between
          ancient cultures that would not seem to be related at first glance
          have long fascinated me, and no one explores these connections better
          than Laird, both in his scholarship and level of detail. If you want
          to explore the evidence on the eerie similarities between ancient
          civilizations, get your copy of
          <i>The Mystery of Skara Brae</i> today.”
