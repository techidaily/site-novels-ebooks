            >These days we're taught that death is the period at the end of the
            sentence of life. A hard stop. The end. So, many of us have never
            had faith in the idea that death might just be a simple transition
            to another form of life. But suppose that's what it is? And suppose
            there's proof?</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br /><i>The Afterlife Book</i> takes a close look at the hidden
          workings of the spirit world and the endless life of the soul, how it
          all seems to function, and the <i>earthly</i> forces at play that
          influence the relationship between the afterlife and life as we know
          it.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In the Book you'll find ancient mystics, oracles, and thinkers, Michio
          Kaku and his quantum physics world, Deepak Chopra and his spiritual
          philosophy, Caroline Myss and her work on Native American
          spirituality, Edgar Cayce and his psychic genius. Here you'll find Dr.
          Carl Jung, Dr. Raymond Moody, Jr., Dr. Brian Weiss, Dr. Ian Stevenson,
          and Dr. Jim Tucker and their research into death and memory. Here
          you'll find Albert Einstein and Pythagoras alongside a New Jersey cab
          driver, a Long Island executive, a California electrician, a
          Massachusetts singer, a Virginia woman of strong Christian faith. Here
          you'll find mediums from the 1700s on, including today's Jeffrey
          Wands, George Anderson, Lisa Williams, Theresa Caputo. Here you'll
          find Andy Griffith and Jerry Orbach and Elvis Presley, right alongside
          Socrates, Madame Blavatsky, Abraham Lincoln, and Amedeo Modigliani.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Overall, <i>The Afterlife Book</i> is an informative and entertaining
          read, a book that talks about a whole new/old way of looking at life
          and after-life. Jeannie Reed notes, "Maybe after reading this, we
          won't be afraid of dying anymore."<br />

          “Death is simply a graduation and not a termination. I have personally
          experienced a past life and an NDE and know the truth. My wife died
          four years ago, and she continues to communicate with me via objects,
          sounds, and particularly numbers. Finding a dime and penny relates to
          our marriage on the eleventh. When my heart developed an arrhythmia
          after my wife's death I went to the hospital for treatment and every
          room I was put in as a patient and my hospital number and visit number
          always added up to a nine or was room nine. My wife was born on 9/9 so
          I knew she was with me. Mystics I know have also brought messages
          about her right after she died, letting me know she was okay and back
          with family. They shared intimate details from the previously deceased
          family that they could not have known in any other way. Our bodies die
          but our consciousness does not. I also have an angel that others have
          seen standing by me and why I'll be writing more books, too.&nbsp;<i

          >&nbsp;by Jeannie Read shares all the information and experiences I
          have learned about the reality of life and death. I recommend everyone
          read it and learn.”<br /><b>—Bernie Siegel, MD</b>,&nbsp;<i

          >, and&nbsp;<i>Three Men, Six Lives</i><br /><br />“I have spent many
          decades working as a medium, but rarely have I discovered that one of
          my sessions has resulted in anything like <i>The Afterlife Book</i>. I
          know Jeannie Reed to be honest, careful, and modest, and her book
          bears all the marks of such an approach to the material. I found it
          fascinating to read. The chapter on the artist, Amedeo Modigliani, is
          outstanding, and as totally ‘real’ as I know such things to be. I
          suspect that anybody who reads this book will no longer be quite so
          afraid of the transition that is physical death. I wish such a
          blessing for all.”&nbsp;<br /><b>—Jeffrey Wands</b>,<i>
