          &nbsp;<br />
          When it comes to meditation practices, the body is as important as the
          mind—a fact that may come as a surprise to the many people who regard
          meditation as a strictly mental activity. But, as Will Johnson shows,
          the physical aspect of the practice is far too often underemphasized.
          The alert-yet-relaxed sitting posture that is the common denominator
          of so many meditative techniques is a wonderful aid for clearing the
          mind and opening the heart, but it also works to activate the natural
          healing energies of both body and mind. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In this essential guidebook, Will Johnson shows how meditation, too
          often misunderstood as a mental practice, can be immeasurably enriched
          through an embodied approach.
          <i>The Posture of Meditation</i> features a range of simple practices
          based on the principles of alignment, relaxation, and resilience. This
          classic book—now with a new section detailing the transformative power
          of the path of somatic meditation—has helped thousands of people to
          begin their meditation practice, to refine it, and to experience
          depths they never thought possible.

          “When Will Johnson first offered <i>The Posture of Meditation </i>in
          1996, meditation posture was widely seen as a relatively unimportant,
          somewhat peripheral aspect of one’s practice. This book changed all
          that, and, over the course of the next 25 years, Johnson convinced
          more and more practitioners that without the three somatic
          foundations—alignment, relaxation, and resilience—meditation can’t go
          anywhere. With those three fundaments, it can and does go everywhere,
          right up to realization. And it doesn’t matter what your meditative
          tradition is. Johnson’s book has deeply influenced several generations
          of meditators and meditation teachers. He has changed the
          conversation. He has been a bright light in the darkness of the
          disembodied—as he says, the ‘somatophobic’—spirituality of our times.
          Hence, the reissuing of his groundbreaking work must be a source of
          delight and joy for all who practice and teach meditation.”—Reggie
          Ray, author of <i>Somatic Descent </i>and
          <i>The Awakening Body<br /></i><br />
          “Finally, after years in the shadows, the somatic turn is
          revolutionizing modern Buddhism. Will Johnson, with the gentleness and
          clarity of a master meditator, leads us home to the body where the
          wakefulness we have been seeking awaits.
          <i>The Posture of Meditation</i>, a true classic, demonstrates how
          body and breath are our true spiritual home, how the simplest of
          practices ground, enliven, and free you. This path of somatic dharma
          will not only transform your mindfulness practice—it may well change
          your life.”—Willa Miller, author of <i>Everyday Dharma<br /></i><br />
          “Instantly enriching and insightful. Will offers a refreshing
          exploration of the body’s central role in the path of transformation.
          Filled with ‘a-ha’ moments, this book breathes new life into the core
          concepts and philosophical underpinnings of meditation. Anyone
          desiring deeper clarity in their practice and life would benefit from
          reading this.”—Ralph De La Rosa, author of
          <i>The Monkey Is the Messenger </i>and
          <i>Don’t Tell Me to Relax<br /></i><br />
          “Will Johnson’s much-welcomed second edition to his classic book,
          <i>The Posture of Meditation</i>, is a poetic and powerful declaration
          of the centrality of bodily experience in our task of waking up. Going
          thoroughly through and then beyond the important physicalities of
          sitting practice, Johnson deftly shows us how sensation and movement
          can be our primary delivery systems of resilience, quiescence, and
          profound presence. He calls this <i>somatic dharma, </i>and it is
          indeed a powerful teaching. He simply and clearly reveals the ways in
          which our physical aliveness—our being with our ongoing shimmering
          sensations and amoeba-like movements—carries us into awakened states
          of mind. This in turn helps us to experience a ‘felt union with all.’
          Once again, a classic is born.”—Christine Caldwell, author of
          <i>Bodyfulness </i>and <i>Getting Our Bodies Back<br /></i><br />
          “Spiritual awakening is not an escape from the human body, but rather
          a conscious surrender into the experience of being fully human. Will
          Johnson understands the vital importance of humanity realizing its
          true nature as living form, living embodiment.”—Robert K. Hall, MD,
          cofounder of the Lomi Foundation
