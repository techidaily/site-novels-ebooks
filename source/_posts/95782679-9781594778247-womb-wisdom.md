          Tools to awaken the creative powers of the womb <br />
          <br />• Contains exercises to open the womb’s energetic pathways,
          release toxic emotions, and harness creative potential <br />
          <br />• Reveals how the womb’s energies are crucial for the spiritual
          shift of 2012: birthing a new civilization <br />
          <br />• Shows how the awakened womb can also bring about male
          spiritual transformation <br />
          <br />• Includes audio tracks to help awaken creative energies <br />
          <br />In the past and in present-day indigenous traditions, women have
          known that the womb houses the greatest power a woman possesses: the
          power to create on all levels. Utilized in the process of giving
          birth, this power of creation can also be tapped in the birth of
          projects, careers, personal healing, spirituality, and relationships.
          However, because the womb stores the energetic imprint of every
          intimate encounter--loving or not--the creative voice of the womb is
          often muffled or absent altogether, affecting the emotional, mental,
          and spiritual health of women and their relationships. <br />
          <br />Drawing on sacred traditions from ancient India, Tibet, Egypt,
          Gnostic Christianity, and Judaism, the practice of Womb Wisdom
          empowers women to become aware of the intuitive voice of the womb
          outside of pregnancy and the moon cycle to unlock this potent inner
          source for creativity, birthing the new conscious children, spiritual
          growth, and transformation not only for themselves but also for their
          male partners. The authors include exercises to clear the past,
          release toxic emotions, open the womb’s energetic pathways, activate
          the sacred sensual self, bring balance to relationships, and harness
          creative potential. Including intimate, individual stories of women
          experiencing the opening of the womb, this book also explores the
          forgotten sacred sites of the womb around the world as well as how the
          womb’s energies are crucial to birth a new civilization in the
          spiritual shift of 2012. The accompanying 45 minutes of audio tracks
          includes a soundscape to assist in the awakening of these creative
          forces.

          “<i>Womb Wisdom</i> is a book that can reactivate the deep, inherent,
          often forgotten feminine power within us. Taking Tantra to the next
          level of unconditional love, appreciation, gratitude, and compassion
          for all beings, <i>Womb Wisdom </i>reveals the union of male and
          female through the greatest secret that women have: the womb. Woven
          within the pages is the intimate true-life account of how Anaiya
          opened the seven gates and five spirals that eventually led to the
          full opening of her womb. This book is a hands-on practical approach,
          packed with tools and ways to integrate this wisdom into your everyday
          lives. <i>Womb Wisdom </i>is a vital key to dissolving the problems in
          modern-day relationships and to entering the mystical chamber of the
          heart in union with the womb, in relationship. Women and men together
          as one!”
