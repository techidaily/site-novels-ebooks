          • Reveals the afterlife as a fluid realm of imagination and invention,
          a luminous landscape created entirely of consciousness <br /><br />•
          Explains how to navigate the early stages of the afterlife, how we
          learn and grow in the spirit world, and how to release anxiety about
          the end of life <br /><br />• Includes exercises and meditations to
          prepare you for navigating and communicating in spirit
          <br /><br />There is no better source of information on death and the
          afterlife than someone who has died and lives in spirit. Channeling
          his late son, Jordan, psychologist Matthew McKay offers a postdeath
          guide for the living, revealing in vivid detail what to expect when we
          die and how to prepare for the wonders of the afterlife.
          <br /><br />Specifically describing the transition experience and the
          early stages of the afterlife, including how to navigate each stage,
          Jordan shows how death is a fluid realm of imagination and invention,
          a luminous landscape created entirely of consciousness. He explains
          how a soul that has newly crossed over is an amnesiac, arriving
          without senses, a nervous system, and all that has anchored us to the
          world. Jordan details how to navigate without a body, how we learn and
          grow in the spirit world, and how to release anxiety about the end of
          life and instead view it as another stage of being. He shows that the
          inferno described by Dante is an optional nightmare caused by thought
          projections that overwhelm the newly transitioned soul, and he reveals
          that the bardos are where souls who are beset with fear and false
          beliefs spend time learning and recovering. <br /><br />Providing
          profound relief from the fear of death, as well as exercises to
          prepare you for navigating and communicating in spirit, Jordan’s
          message reveals how love is the bonding element that holds all of
          consciousness--and the afterlife--together. McKay also documents the
          unbreakable bond between the living and the dead and teaches the skill
          of channeling, allowing you to connect to loved ones who have passed.

          “In <i>The Luminous Landscape of the Afterlife</i> we are offered a
          spirit-inspired glimpse of what may await us beyond this life and how
          to prepare for it now. Above all, we learn that consciousness is
          eternal, that love is everything, and that death is not the end but
          rather a series of new beginnings. A thought-provoking and expansive
          book about the afterlife that will challenge you, offer comfort, and
          reconnect you with who and what you are and why you’re here.”
