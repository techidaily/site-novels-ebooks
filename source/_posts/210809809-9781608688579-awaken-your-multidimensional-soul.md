          <strong>Wisdom for a New World</strong><br />
          <br />
          Lee Harris began channeling the Z’s in 1999 and has since shared their
          insights with millions around the world through recordings, workshops,
          and books. Here he offers a unique presentation, one in which
          psychotherapist Dianna Edwards interviews the Z’s. The result is a
          riveting way for you to receive these messages and incorporate their
          wisdom. This second volume of Conversations with the Z’s covers how
          to:<br />
          <br />
          • amplify your heart energy, which the Z’s call “the most important,
          abundant, and creational energy on Earth”<br />
          • strengthen your connection with angels and guides<br />
          • heal from past experiences and let go of fears<br />
          • understand and better navigate personal or global states of
          disharmony<br />
          <br />
          As these conversations persuasively and provocatively show, the Z’s
          want to help each of us tap into our multidimensional soul and embody
          the oneness that is our true nature.<br />

          “Thank you, Lee and your wonderful guides, for taking the time and
          energy to create this offering for us all. I just opened the book to a
          random page, and the message I got was exactly the answer to a
          question I have been carrying. We usually can’t take the cosmic
          answers to our human questions fully in, but once in a while, the
          answer goes straight in and transforms us forever. This book has the
          power to do just that.”<br />

          underlying energies at work and play in our world, the meaning of our
          relationships, and the journey of our souls here on Earth.
          Illuminating and insight-full, this book will marvelously remind you
          how precious this life is and how vast we all are!”<br />
