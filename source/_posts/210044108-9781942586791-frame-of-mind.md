          At age 18, Joey Slunisky is excited for the future. With a sharp mind
          and plenty of ambition, he can't wait to start college and put himself
          on the path for his dream career in nuclear and metallurgical
          engineering.Then, like a bolt out of the blue comes a shocking
          diagnosis: cancer. With that one word, Joey feels like his whole world
          is coming to an end. His first reaction is disbelief, followed by
          anger, fear, and depression. The deforming cancer surgery cuts out
          half his throat and left shoulder muscles. The repulsive image takes
          its toll on his body and his spirit, and all he wants to do is
          withdraw from the world. But thanks to God's blessings of the support
          of a loving family and friends, as well as the intervention of a
          skilled and caring doctor, Joey is able to heal both physically and
          mentally. After a few months, he starts college with his ambitions
          back on track.Unrelentingly, life hurls overwhelming obstacles in
          Joey's path. Repeatedly the cancer rears its ugly head. Every time
          Joey moves two steps forward, a new cancer diagnosis drags him one
          step back. Again, the wise and kindly Dr. Saabs intercedes to help
          keep Joey's demons at bay. Joey begins to understand that his
          attitude, even more so than his physical challenges, will determine
          his future. With a never-give-up attitude, Joey embarks on a positive
          start to his career. He finds the love of his life and then parlays a
          position from a student metallurgist program into an attractive job
          offer as a metallurgical engineer. It's a promising start for a young
          engineer, but Joey has his eyes on a bigger prize. Despite continuous
          health problems and countless setbacks, Joey never lets go of a
          professional dream that can be summed up in two words: Oak Ridge.This
          inspiring story of a young man who has his life sidelined time and
          time again shows that while we can't always control the things that
          happen to us, we can control how we respond. The type of life we have
          is dependent upon our frame of mind.
