            >LEARN WHAT MESSAGES YOUR ANGELS HAVE FOR YOU WHEN YOU SEE NUMBERS
            FROM 0 THROUGH 999 LIKE 1:11, 2:22, AND 5:55</b
          ><br /><b><br /></b>Are you seeing repeating numbers like 11:11 and
          4:44 everywhere you turn?<br />In <i>Angel Numbers</i>, world-renowned
          angel author Kyle Gray explains exactly what your angels and spirit
          guides are trying to tell you through repeated number sequences you
          see.<br /><br />In this day and age, our understanding of the cosmos
          is all calculated using numbers, so it’s no wonder that angels, the
          universe’s greatest divine messengers since the dawn of time, are
          using numbers to send us signs and messages from heaven.<br /><br />There’s
          a good chance you have seen number sequences appearing time and time
          again in your life—on license plates, purchase receipts, flight
          numbers and of course your phone—and these numbers aren’t just
          numbers, they’re angel numbers.<br /><br />They are angel messages and
          calls to action. Now that we are living in what can only be described
          as a digital age, angels are using the numbers we see on digital
          clocks, such as 11:11, 1:23, 21:12, 22:22, and 5:55 to help remind you
          of your higher truth.<br /><br />Some Example Angel Number
          Meanings:<br /><br />12:12<br />You have the power to bring healing
          and light to the world. Notice how your intentions and actions are
          already doing just that.<br /><br />4:44<br />Your guardian angels
          want you to know that they are with you. Your prayers are being heard
          loud and clear. Have faith.<br /><br />1:23<br />You are moving up a
          step. All the challenges you have previously experienced are now being
          released. The angels of ascension are with you.<br /><br />“Kyle Gray
          is one of the world’s most incredibly gifted angel communicators. I
          have seen him work and he is authentic, intelligent, and deeply
          compassionate. I highly recommend him and all his creations!”<br />–
          Colette Baron-Reid, international bestselling oracle expert<br /><br />Whenever
          you need guidance from your angels, simply ask.
          <i>Angel Numbers </i>is the perfect companion to refer to daily as a
          reminder that your angels are always listening and sending you loving
          messages to help with whatever you are going through.

        <p>
          <b>Kyle Gray</b> is one of the UK's youngest, most sought after angel
          experts. He discovered his spiritual connection at the tender age of
          four, when he communed with his deceased grandmother. Since then, he
          has been blessed with a strong connection to the angels, who have
          guided him as he developed his intuitive gifts. After years of hiding
          his abilities, Kyle was called to share the angels' incredible
          messages with the world. Now, Kyle dedicates his life to helping other
          people crack open to the angels through his workshops, talks and his
          Online Angel Tribe. He is the author of six books and co-creator of
          three oracle card decks.
