          A working guide to the proper methods of interacting with the full
          Vodou pantheon <br /><br />• Includes the myths, cultural heritage,
          and ancestral lineage of the lwa and how to honor and serve them
          <br /><br />• Provides an introduction and guide that is especially
          useful for the solitary practitioner <br /><br />• Discusses the
          relationship between Vodou, Haitian culture, and Catholicism
          <br /><br />In The Haitian Vodou Handbook, Kenaz Filan, an initiate of
          the Société la Belle Venus, presents a working guide to the proper
          methods of interacting with the full Vodou pantheon, explaining how to
          build respectful relationships with the lwa, the spirits honored in
          Haitian Vodou, and how to transform the fear that often surrounds the
          Vodou religion.<br /><br />Until recently, the Haitian practice of
          Vodou was often identified with devil worship, dark curses, and
          superstition. Some saw the saint images and the Catholic influences
          and wrote Vodou off as a “Christian aberration.” Others were appalled
          by the animal sacrifices and the fact that the Houngans and Mambos
          charge money for their services. Those who sought Vodou because they
          believed it could harness “evil” forces were disappointed when their
          efforts to gain fame, fortune, or romance failed and so abandoned
          their “voodoo fetishes.” Those who managed to get the attention of the
          lwa, often received cosmic retaliation for treating the spirits as
          attack dogs or genies, which only further cemented Vodou’s stereotype
          as “dangerous.”<br /><br />Filan offers extensive background
          information on the featured lwa, including their mythology and
          ancestral lineage, as well as specific instructions on how to honor
          and interact fruitfully with those that make themselves accessible.
          This advice will be especially useful for the solitary practitioner
          who doesn’t have the personal guidance of a societé available. Filan
          emphasizes the importance of having a quickened mind that can read the
          lwa’s desires intuitively in order to avoid establishing dogma-based
          relationships. This working guide to successful interaction with the
          full Vodou pantheon also presents the role of Vodou in Haitian culture
          and explores the symbiotic relationship Vodou has maintained with
          Catholicism.

          and gives us a fascinating introduction to the history and culture of
          Haiti. This book will be important to all who feel that religious
          practice makes a practical difference in our lives."
