            >Weaving together the story of his fractured relationship to his
            mother with research into her paranormal abilities, Dr. Christian
            Smith has created, in <i>The Scientist and the Psychic</i>, a
            captivating, one-of-a-kind memoir of belief, skepticism and familial
            love.</b
          ><br /><br />Christian Smith realized his mother was different in the
          autumn of 1977 when he was eight years old. Before then, he'd
          witnessed séances at home and the kids at school sometimes teased him
          about his mom being a witch--so he sensed that his life wasn't
          typical. But it wasn't until he was backstage at a renowned concert
          venue in Toronto, watching from behind a curtain as Geraldine
          commanded an audience of 2,000 with her extrasensory readings, that he
          understood she was special. As Geraldine's only child, he would assume
          the role of the quiet observer while she guided a live CBC broadcast
          of a séance; made startling and consistently accurate predictions; and
          eventually moved to LA to work with the parents of murder victims--and
          with convicted murderer Jeffrey R. MacDonald. Over time, the high
          profile and emotionally depleting work affected Geraldine's health and
          relationships. Addiction took over her life, and her son pulled
          away.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast forward to the present
          day: Christian is a molecular biologist and Geraldine is retired and
          in poor health. They are closer than they've ever been, and now he
          gives us the story of her undeniable perceptual abilities and
          pioneering work as a psychic--and endeavours to make scientific sense
          of it.

          “In this utterly fascinating book, Christian Smith’s science
          background is juxtaposed with his mother’s paranormal gifts as a
          psychic medium, pitting research against experiences that cannot be
          replicated. Smith’s search for absolute proof of both the afterlife
          and the survival of consciousness after death will push even the most
          skeptical minds towards acceptance.
          <i>The Scientist and the Psychic</i> is also a love letter from a son
          to his mother—a ‘behind the lens’ exploration of mediumship,
          channeling, psychometry, and telepathy, and the heart-breaking toll
          these extraordinary gifts exacted on Geraldine Stringer’s closest
          family members, and on herself. A candid story told with honesty and
          great poignancy, and an absolute must-read.” —<b>Susan Doherty</b>,
          author of <i>The Ghost Garden<br /><br /></i>“<i
            >The Scientist and the Psychic</i
          >
          is well-written and thought-provoking—an intriguing twist on the tale
          of a child of whose celebrated parent attends more to her public than
          to them. Christian Smith offers compelling ideas about his mother’s
          psychic mind and celebrates, in the end, the gifts of connection and
          forgiveness.” —<b>Patricia Pearson</b>, author of
          <i>Opening Heaven’s Door </i>and <i>Wish You Were Here</i>
