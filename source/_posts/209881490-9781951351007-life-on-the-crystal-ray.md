          <p>
            If you have ever heard the term “Christ-Consciousness,” or
            “Crystalline Frequency,” and have wondered just exactly what these
            terms mean, then you’ve come to the right place.&nbsp;In essence,
            these terms mean basically the same thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I woke up, literally WOKE UP to WHO I AM over the Holiday Season
            2018-2019. It was like all the years of the spiritual mastery work I
            have been doing for decades all of sudden became CRYSTAL
            CLEAR—literally.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, I’m sharing my journey of Living Crystalline with you, so
            that you can also have a glimpse of what Being Crystal is like. In a
            sense, it is a guide &amp; handbook for the Crystal Being, and those
            becoming Crystalline, intended to assist you in ushering in the
            Crystal Golden Age at the highest level of Miracle Vision Mastery
            that you can Live —&nbsp;now.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not everyone has come here to be Crystalline in this
            embodiment, you can still receive great benefit, clarity and balance
            by feeling into this material, working with, and integrating, only
            what works best for you at this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there will come a point where all must be done. As such, at
            some point, you will have an embodiment where your primary goal is
            to become Crystalline.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mastering the Christ-Consciousness in THIS embodiment ensures the
            Victory of your own Ascension, either at the close of your current
            embodiment, or the one where you DO eventually come to master this.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter who we are or what archetypes we identify with—Angels,
            Cosmic Beings, Ascended Masters, Faeries, Archangels—we are still
            Beings of Light, Created Perfect, Whole and Complete by God.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we see all around us—what appears as separation and not-Love—is
            not the truth of God's Created Universe, though. What we see is a
            projection of Its opposite—playing out for no other purpose than to
            re-align each of our minds with what IS the Ultimate Truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crystal Beings in particular, I have noticed, appear to be here
            specifically to manifest the undoing of not-Truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may recognize this within yourself, without having had a
            specific number of integrations with other aspects of God's
            Creation, such as the Faery Realm, or the Angelic Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are heirarchies within the levels of mastery, and as we go
            deeply within the Crystal Being, we see that the learning always
            begins at square 1 ~ with whatever aspect of Creation we are
            resonating with at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I cannot speak for all of us because some of us are born with
            full-on awakening, but for many of us—we appear to come "here," to
            Earth, as a "bodily" form, with beautiful Gifts our Creator endowed
            us with. It is because we are a direct extension of our Creator that
            our natural inheritance is of such—Divine Gifts of Natural Skill and
            Great Blessing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within this material, you will discover how you can apply Miracle
            Vision Mastery, and have you mastering your spiritual vision within
            the twinkling of an eye!&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>Be prepared for miracles!</p>

          “This is a totally DELIGHTFUL book, presented with Crystal Clarity. I
          like to think of this book as a "handbook for being a living
          crystal.”<br /><br />This book may be of special interest to:<br />~those
          working with crystals and crystal energies.<br />~those wishing to
          become "crystal-clear" in their spiritual evolution.<br />~those
          involved in Ascended Master Teachings, or in A Course In Miracles.<br /><br />I
          highly recommend this book for all such people.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also includes a host of very down-to-earth practical tips for
          raising your vibrations.

          contents, which in most books, I skip over.

          informative, and high vibrationally intentioned.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your

          Crystal Ray Beings and way of Life.

          to you.

          Yes, it was like listening to you over tea!&nbsp;<br /><br />True to
          form and to yourself, you have indeed created an authentic, high
          vibrational work!”
