          Hidden within age-old classic stories lie the hermetic teachings of
          alchemy and Freemasonry <br />
          <br />• Explains how the stages of the Great Work are encoded in both
          little known and popular stories such as <i>Cinderella</i>,
          <i>Snow White</i>, and<i> Little Red Riding Hood </i> <br />
          <br />• Reveals the connection between Mother Goose and important
          esoteric symbols of the Western Mystery tradition <br />
          <br />• Demonstrates the ancient lineage of these stories and how they
          originated as the trigger to push humanity toward higher levels of
          consciousness <br />
          <br />In his <i>Mystery of the Cathedrals</i>, the great alchemist
          Fulcanelli revealed the teachings of the hermetic art encoded in the
          sculpture and stained glass of the great cathedrals of Europe. What he
          did for churches, his disciple Bernard Roger does here for fairy
          tales. <br />
          <br />Through exhaustive analysis of the stories collected by the
          Brothers Grimm, Perrault, and others, Roger demonstrates how hermetic
          ideas, especially those embodied in alchemy and Freemasonry, can be
          found in fairy tales, including such popular stories as
          <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Snow White</i>, <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>, and
          <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i> as well as the tales attributed to
          “Mother Goose.” The goose has long been an important esoteric symbol
          in the Western Mystery tradition. The stories told under the aegis of
          Mother Goose carry these symbols and secrets, concealed in what
          hermetic adepts have long called “the language of the birds.” <br />
          <br />Drawing upon the original versions of fairy tales, not the
          sanitized accounts made into children’s movies, the author reveals how
          the tales illustrate each stage of the Great Work and the alchemical
          iterations required to achieve them. He shows how the common motif of
          a hero or heroine sent in search of a rare object by a sovereign
          before their wishes can be granted is analogous to the Masonic quest
          for the lost tomb of Hiram or the alchemist’s search for the fire
          needed to perform the Great Work. He also reveals how the hero is
          always aided by a green bird, which embodies the hermetic
          understanding of the seed and the fruit. <br />
          <br />By unveiling the secret teachings within fairy tales, Roger
          demonstrates the truly ancient lineage of these initiatory stories and
          how they originated as the trigger to push humanity toward higher
          levels of consciousness.

          “Etymology, mythology, and esoteric thought converge in a fascinating
          journey through the worlds of tall tales we tell in jest, yarns we
          spin for laughs, and fairy tales we weave to put the kids to bed.
          Indeed, Roger’s book shows that what we think of as a ‘hidden’ path to
          enlightenment is in fact written into the very fabric of our daily
          lives, in every story we tell ourselves. What we are shown is that
          these tales of fancy have within them the kernel of truths humanity
          has known for thousands of years. The book knits together a compelling
          genealogy that links our stories, our hopes, and our dreams. A
          compelling read for the novice and initiate alike.”
