          A rich and original collection of Dharma teachings,
          <i>Moonlight Leaning Against an Old Rail Fence</i> weaves the poetic
          and the expository in a series of Zen poems and commentaries that
          invite both direct experience and meditative study.&nbsp;Paul Weiss
          evokes the awake, pristine, and poetic nature of our human experience
          while also examining the mechanisms of ego that define our personal
          and cultural experience of separation and suffering.&nbsp;Here you
          will find simple, ecstatic celebrations of luminous and transparent
          reality; clarification of technical points of practice; support for
          everyday life; and reflections on issues of history, culture, and
          human ecology.&nbsp;All become threads in a jeweled net of integrative
          spiritual thought and practice that will inform and encourage any
          reader's practice, contemplation and personal growth.
          <i>Moonlight Leaning Against an Old Rail Fence</i> points beyond our
          literal fixations with language, ideas, and doctrines to the great
          ungraspable poetic reality that is expressed in all our spirituality
          and in all our human experience.

          “Paul Weiss fearlessly transmits virtue through sharing with us
          everything from the prajnaparamita of the New York subway system to
          the spiritual authority of the wild earth, to loving instructions on
          how to stay awake in the face of the harsh realities of the world
          today.&nbsp;With the perspective and inclusiveness that come from a
          lifetime of practice and realization, he helps us make sense of the
          world we live in, affirm our deepest nature and capacity as human
          beings, and bring alive the possibilities for our own engaged
          practice. Drink deeply.”<br />
          —Sarah M. Vekasi, MDiv, founder of the Eco-Chaplaincy Initiative<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Paul Weiss is a Dharma teacher with lots of heart wisdom. I have
          known Paul for many years, and it is truly exciting to see that he has
          written this book to capture his deep understanding of the spiritual
          path. This is a beautiful gift for all of us, and reading it can help
          to open our hearts.”&nbsp; <br />
          —Anam Thubten Rinpoche, founder and spiritual advisor to the Dharmata
          Foundation and author of <i>No Self, No Problem</i> and
          <i>The Magic of Awareness</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          Paul Weiss lives, teaches, and wanders in the woods on the coast of
          Maine. He began his zen and tai chi training in New York in the
          mid-60s and practiced in New York and San Francisco before first
          coming to Maine in 1969 to live and study with Walter Nowick, one of
          the first American zen masters.&nbsp;Over the years Weiss has drunk
          deeply of several spiritual traditions and teachers and has studied at
          length in India and China.&nbsp;He founded The Whole Health Center
          with his wife, Alexandra, in Bar Harbor, Maine, in 1981, where he has
          brought together the fruits of his broad training.&nbsp;Today he
          continues to counsel with individuals, couples, and small groups,
          offers many retreats—including his True Heart/True Mind Intensives—and
          teaches a spirituality of integrative human development and conscious
          loving presence.&nbsp;A volume of poems, <i>You Hold This, </i>was
          published in 2013.
