            >“Dr. Leo Galland, a respected global leader in the eld of holistic
            medicine, has written an astounding book of revelations about the
            nature of heaven and earth, loss and pain, and love.”&nbsp;—
            Christiane Northrup, M.D., #1 <i>New York Times </i>best-selling
            author<br /></b
          ><br /><i>Already Here</i> tells of the death of Leo Galland’s son,
          Christopher, at the age of 22; the direct visual evidence Christopher
          showed him that our souls do go on; and the communications he received
          from Christopher’s spirit that dramatically changed Leo’s
          understanding of life and its meaning.<br /><br />In life, Christopher
          was a brain-damaged special needs child who challenged everyone he
          knew with his unpredictable behavior and uncanny insights. After his
          death, he revealed to Leo the real purpose of his life, as a spiritual
          guide who taught others by confounding their assumptions and
          expectations. And he began to share with Leo a new perspective on
          everything from the nature of good and evil to the concept of
          timelessness to the notion that the universe is, fundamentally, an act
          of love.<br /><br />Christopher’s wisdom was revealed to Leo over the
          course of a year, coalescing into three themes, which Leo calls the
          Gift of the Opposite, the Gift of Presence, and the Gift of
          Timelessness. Leo quickly came to realize that these gifts were not
          for him alone: they contain ancient wisdom, held sacred in many
          traditions, that Chris intended him to share with others. He has
          written this book, under Chris’s direction, to do just that.<br /><br /><i
            >Already Here</i
          >
          presents a unique dialogue in which an analytical, scientific mind
          tries to comprehend truths from another plane of existence —one that,
          nonetheless, is inseparable from our own. Chris describes Heaven and
          Earth, spirit and matter, as unified opposites that cannot exist
          without each other and cannot be separated from human consciousness.
          The book takes its title from Christopher’s final message to Leo, in
          which he describes Heaven as an “eternal present” where everyone is
          together, even those of us still living earthly lives. “Lighten up,”
          Christopher says to his father. “You’re already here, you know.”

          "Leo Galland brings us on a journey of the heart, infinite awareness,
          and discovery."<br />— <b>Deepak Chopra, M.D.</b>, author of
          <i>You Are the Universe</i><br /><br />"Dr. Leo Galland, a respected
          global leader in the field of holistic medicine, has written an
          astounding book of revelations about the nature of heaven and earth,
          loss and pain, and love. All guided by the spirit of his special-needs
          son, Chris, who died at the age of 22. I read the entire book in one
          unforgettable afternoon and was profoundly moved. You don’t want to
          miss this one."<br />— <b>Christiane Northrup, M.D.</b>, #1
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author<br /><br />"Climbing inside
          the human brain is a daunting assignment, one that is made even more
          challenging when that brain is damaged. This is what makes
          <i>Already Here</i>—Leo Galland’s searingly personal account of the
          life and death of his 22-year-old special-needs son, Christopher—such
          a gripping and triumphant story. Part intimate memoir, part spiritual
          guidebook, Galland’s heartfelt chronicle of his family’s journey
          through their ordeal is a spellbinding exploration of life after
          death, and a bracing reminder of the indestructible power of a
          father’s love. At one point in the story, Galland underscores the
          impact Christopher had on his family, recalling his brother once
          saying, ‘I really need a dose of Christopher.’ Just one day after
          finishing this remarkable and inspiring book, I found myself longing
          for another dose of Christopher, too."<br />— <b>Marlo Thomas</b>,
          award-winning actress, producer, activist, and best-selling author of
          <i>Free to Be . . . You and Me</i><br /><br />"<i>Already Here</i> is
          an amazing journey from the rational to the intuitive, living in the
          moment, birthed by love, pain, and loss. When I finished, I looked at
          adversity and time differently and decided to surrender with joy."<br />—
          <b>Susan Sarandon</b>, mother, activist, and Academy Award–winning
          actress<br /><br />"<i>Already Here</i> is a heart-touching story of
          how love transcends death and that those who pass never leave without
          leaving something behind for us to continue living with. Christopher
          is a beacon and wise soul who has and continues to touch many from his
          life in the spirit world. I found this story food for my soul."<br />—
          <b>James Van Praagh</b>, spiritual teacher and
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>The Power of Love</i
          ><br /><br />"<i>Already Here</i> is an awe-inspiring after-death
          communication received by a medical doctor from his son Christopher
          who had crossed over after a fatal accident. Soon after, signs began
          to appear and Chris began speaking to his father, imparting his
          knowledge and wisdom about the purpose of life. This inspiring book is
          an education for living—about how to enjoy life to its fullest,
          transforming anger and hate into love, about being human, and how love
          transcends physical death."<br />— <b>Anita Moorjani</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Dying to Be Me</i> and
          <i>What If This Is Heaven? </i><br /><br />"I’ve known Leo Galland for
          many years as having one of the most brilliant medical minds for
          solving complex problems. <i>Already Here</i> reveals his personal
          journey beyond medicine into the deeper world of spirit, arising from
          the passing of his son. It’s a journey of true healing and wisdom
          profoundly presented. I couldn’t put it down."<br />—
          <b>Stephan Rechtschaffen, M.D.</b>, founder of Blue Spirit Costa Rica
          and co-founder of Omega Institute<br /><br />"This is a beautiful book
          to read gently, allowing emotional response to the written events as
          they unfold peacefully. It’s a winner!"<br />— <b>Judith Stanton</b>,
          co-author of <i>Emmanuel’s Book</i><br /><br />"Words can’t capture
          the ineffable experience of Presence, which is timeless and eternal,
          more closely than Dr. Leo Galland in <i>Already Here</i>. This is a
          heartwarming and eloquent description of that experience, which is all
          the more extraordinary because his training as a highly rational mind
          allows him to integrate, understand, and explain the personal meaning
          of such an experience."<br />— <b>Dr. Jay Lombard</b>, neuroscientist
          and author of <i>The Mind of God</i>
