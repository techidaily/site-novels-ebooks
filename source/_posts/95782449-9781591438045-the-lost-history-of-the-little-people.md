          Reveals an ancient race of Little People, the catalyst for the
          emergence of the first known civilizations <br />
          <br />• Traces the common roots of key words and holy symbols,
          including the scarlet biretta of Catholic cardinals, back to the
          Little People <br />
          <br />• Explains how the mounds of North America and Ireland were not
          burial sites but the homes of the Little People <br />
          <br />• Includes the Tuatha De Danaan, the Hindu Sri Vede, the dwarf
          gods of Mexico and Peru, the Menehune of Hawaii, the Nunnehi of the
          Cherokee as well as African Pygmies and the Semang of Malaysia <br />
          <br />All cultures haves stories of the First People, the “Old Ones,”
          our prehistoric forebears who survived the Great Flood and initiated
          the first sacred traditions. From the squat “gods” of Mexico and Peru
          to the fairy kingdom of Europe to the blond pygmies of Madagascar, on
          every continent of the world they are remembered as masters of stone
          carving, agriculture, navigation, writing, and shamanic healing--and
          as a “hobbit” people, no taller than 31/2 feet in height yet perfectly
          proportioned. <br />
          <br />Linking the high civilizations of the Pleistocene to the Golden
          Age of the Great Little People, Susan Martinez reveals how this lost
          race was forced from their original home on the continent of Pan
          (known in myth as Mu or Lemuria) during the Great Flood of global
          legend. Following the mother language of Pan, Martinez uncovers the
          original unity of humankind in the common roots of key words and holy
          symbols, including the scarlet biretta of Catholic cardinals, and
          shows how the Small Sacred Workers influenced the primitive tribes
          that they encountered in the post-flood diaspora, leading to the rise
          of civilization. Examining the North American mound-culture sites,
          including the diminutive adult remains found there, she explains that
          these stately mounds were not burial sites but the sanctuaries and
          homes of the Little People. <br />
          <br />Drawing on the intriguing worldwide evidence of pygmy tunnels,
          dwarf villages, elf arrows, and tiny coffins, Martinez reveals the
          Little People as the real missing link of prehistory, later sanctified
          and remembered as gods rather than the mortals they were.
