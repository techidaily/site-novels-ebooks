            Can some people see the future? Do some dreams contain warnings? Can
            we observe events unfolding thousands of miles away? Dr. Sally Rhine
            Feather, a director of one of the world's most respected institutes
            for paranormal studies, says <i>yes</i>—and she provides dozens of
            examples of how ESP appears in real life. Referring to decades of
            research of hard facts and data as proof that ESP is real, Dr.
            Feather now reveals breakthrough discoveries which include: what
            circumstances trigger ESP experiences, why some people have more of
            this gift than others, and whether the fate revealed in a dream or
            vision can be changed. <br />Don't miss:<br /><br />· The dream that
            prevented a fatal heart attack of a stranger<br />· Children's
            visions of dead people bringing messages for the living<br />· A
            letter written and mailed that precisely predicted a nephew's injury
            in war<br />· The stolen car recovered in Cleveland with the help of
            a vision<br />· …and more!

          “A wonderful book, filled with fascinating stories from the world's
          largest collection of ESP cases.” —<i
            >Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D., author of The Sense of Being Stared At:
            and Other Unexplained Powers of the Human Mind</i
          ><br /><br />“The authors take us through some amazing anecdotal
          evidence of ESP in this very readable account.” —<i
            >Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D., American Book Award-winning author of Taking
            the Quantum Leap, and Parallel Universes:The Search for Other
            Worlds</i
          ><br /><br />“<b><i>The Gift</i></b> is a collection of insights and
          experiences that we all may experience, but which are not often shared
          with others.” —<i
            >John Edward, author of the New York Times bestseller, Crossing Over
            and One Last Time: A Psychic Medium Speaks to Those We Have Loved
            and Lost</i
          ><br /><br />“<b><i>The Gif</i></b
          ><i>t</i> speaks directly to the needs of millions of people who are
          concerned with the personal meaning of their ESP experiences.” —<i
            >Jeffrey Mishlove, Ph.D., President of Intuition Network and author
            of The PK Man</i
          ><br /><br />“<b><i>The Gift </i></b>presents an astounding array of
          spontaneous psychic experiences that stretch the human definition of
          reality. It should be read by any one interested in understanding the
          limits of the human mind and consciousness.” —<i
            >Joe McMoneagle, author of The Stargate Chronicles: Memoirs of a
            Psychic Spy</i
          ><br /><br />“In my work with couples, I am very familiar with
          partners reporting connection and communication that seems outside the
          bounds of the normal transmission of information. ESP offers an
          explanation. <b><i>The Gift</i></b> is clearly written, with credible
          examples and solid research. Anyone interested in the subject will be
          well informed, and anyone skeptical of ESP will be challenged to
          disprove the phenomena.” —<i

            Getting the Love You Want:A Guide for Couples</i

          ><br /><br />“A great read – suspense, drama, a sense of wonder, and
          any number of surprises. You'll find no better introduction to the
          world of ESP.” —<i
            >Stanley Krippner, Ph.D, co-editor of Varieties of Anomalous
            Experience: Examining the Scientific Evidence</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>The Gift </i>is an extraordinary book that brings

          histories from ordinary people…. A great resource for those interested
