          A powerful story of spiritual awakening, reconnection with Nature, and
          rekindling of ancestral wisdom <br /><br />• Details the author’s
          encounters with ancestral spirits and animal teachers, such as
          Coy-Wolf, and profound moments of direct connection with the natural
          world <br /><br />• Shows how ancestral connections and intimate
          communications with Nature are not unique or restricted to those with
          indigenous cultural roots <br /><br />• Reveals how reconnection with
          ancestors and the natural world offers insight and solutions for the
          complex problems we face <br /><br />We are but a few generations
          removed from millennia spent living in intimate contact with the
          natural world and in close commune with ancestral spirits. Who we are
          and who we think we are is rooted in historical connections with those
          who came before us and in our relationships with the land and the
          sentient natural world. When we wander too far from our roots, our
          ancestors and kin in the natural world call us home, sometimes with
          gentle whispers and sometimes in loud voices sounding alarms.
          <br /><br />In this powerful story of spiritual awakening, Randy
          Kritkausky shares his journey into the realm of ancestral Native
          American connections and intimate encounters with Mother Earth and
          shows how anyone can spiritually reconnect with their ancestors and
          Nature. Like 70 percent of those who identify as Native American,
          Kritkausky grew up off the reservation. As he explains, for such “off
          reservation” indigenous people rediscovering ancestral practices
          amounts to a reawakening and offers significant insights about living
          in a society that is struggling to mend a heavily damaged planet. The
          author reveals how the awakening process was triggered by his own
          self-­questioning and the resumption of ties with his Potawatomi
          ancestors. He details his encounters with ancestral spirits and animal
          teachers, such as Coy-Wolf. He shares moments of direct connection
          with the natural world, moments when the consciousness of other living
          beings, flora and fauna, became accessible and open to communication.
          <br /><br />Through his profound storytelling, Kritkausky shows how
          ancestral connections and intimate communications with Nature are not
          unique or restricted to those with indigenous cultural roots. Offering
          a bridge between cultures, a path that can be followed by Native and
          non-Native alike, the author shows that spiritual awakening can happen
          anywhere, for anyone, and can open the gateway to deeper
          understanding.

          “<i>Without Reservation</i> is a wonderful representation of the
          personal struggles Native American people often find themselves in.
          The conflicts between societal viewpoints and self-determination cause
          many to evaluate and reevaluate themselves on a continuous basis.
          There are often internal power struggles between the European
          viewpoints of what an Indian should be and the mirror of our ancestors
          that shows us who we are--by our mere existence. We are all
          subconsciously drawn to communications from the spirits of our
          ancestors, the environment, and the animal and plant relatives. We
          only have to open our ears, hearts, and minds to receive these
          messages from the great web of life.”
