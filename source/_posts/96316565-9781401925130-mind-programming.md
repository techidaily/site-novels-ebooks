            >The <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
            <i>Choices and Illusions</i></b
          ><br /><br />It is the 21st century and we have experienced a
          technology explosion that has granted us a cornucopia of luxuries and
          opportunities. At this point, virtually anything seems possible.
          However, along with the positive developments are ominous
          collaborations designed to deprive us of an inherent birthright—the
          power of a free mind.<br /><br /><i>Mind Programming</i> is a riveting
          expose on the plethora of research that has been carried out simply to
          discover ways to control your every thought and desire. What you will
          learn will both shock and horrify you. Tweaking your psyche has become
          big business. Never again will you be able to ignore the truth—your
          very thoughts are not your own.<br /><br />
          <i>Mind Programming</i> provides the tools to take back control and
          reprogram your own mind. <b>Eldon Taylor</b> provides the insight,
          information, and easy-to-use methods that will empower you to realize
          the life of your dreams. You were not meant to be the product of
          another’s manipulation, whether in attitude and mood or in ambition
          and consumption.

        <p>
          "In reading Eldon Taylor’s book
          <i
            >Mind Programming: From Persuasion and Brainwashing to Self-Help and
            Practical Metaphysics</i
          >, I embarked upon a journey beginning at Psych 101 and ending deep
          into postgraduate Metaphysics; a reading experience that delivers a
          near-visceral adventure that begins with imagination and ends in
          near-manifestation. Eldon reveals the extraordinary reality of a
          virtually unrecognized dimension where each of us live every day but
          are completely unaware—the subliminal realm. I recently produced a
          motion picture featuring 23 Living Luminaries, each of whom shares
          pearls of wisdom and enlightened insights as to how we can all achieve
          true happiness and our purpose in life. Although it was an
          extraordinary cast, in retrospect I wish there had been 24. Eldon
          Taylor brings an invaluable teaching to seekers of wisdom and
          understanding. The world of higher learning has a new ‘high bar’ with
          his work.”<br /><b>— Michael J Lasky</b>, producer and founder, Gotham
          Metro Studios, Inc.<br /><br />“Dr. Eldon Taylor’s new book is a must
          read! If you’ve ever questioned your purpose in life or felt bound by
          a culture that’s driven by mass media, you now have at your fingertips
          the knowledge and tools to break the chains of this cycle. Eldon goes
          in-depth to illustrate and expose how we’ve been programmed from birth
          by social constraints; and he methodically reveals the psychological
          techniques that advertisers, politicians, corporations, and the media
          use to control us. He then provides strategies and solutions to free
          your mind from these tactics and rise to a new level of consciousness.
          As you read this book, you’ll feel the blinders being removed and will
          truly see the world in an entirely new light.”<br /><b
            >— Jeff Warrick</b
          >, documentary filmmaker, <i>Programming the Nation?</i
          ><br /><br />“I’ve known Eldon Taylor for 20 years and have been
          fascinated with his research regarding subliminal communication. Mind
          programming can be used to control your mind for good or bad.
          <i>Mind Programming</i> presents tools to give you the power to
          program your own mind to empower you to realize your goals and
          desires. Book One deals with the dark side of persuasion methods,
          while Book Two gives you tools to train your own mind in the ways you
          want it to be trained. I especially appreciate his emphasis on
          forgiveness in healing and his serenity affirmations.”<br /><b
            >— Paul G. Durbin, Ph.D.</b
          >, retired Brigadier General, U.S. Army chaplain<br /><br />“There’s
          no doubt that we’re seduced and programmed daily by the media,
          advertising, and world events. It’s a yeoman’s work to protect
          ourselves against these outside influences. Eldon Taylor’s
          groundbreaking book shows us how.”<br /><b>— Caroline Sutherland</b>,
          the author of <i>The Body Knows How to Stay Young</i><br /><br />“A
          brilliant exposé of how we’ve become unconsciously enslaved to that
          which we haven’t understood! Eldon Taylor exposes and explodes the old
          worldview of fear and lack that has generated direct and indirect
          manipulation of our minds without our awareness or permission. With
          well-earned insight, he offers proven pathways of self-empowerment
          that entrain our consciousness toward the model of unity and abundance
          that negates the survival paradigm. In a period when fear has reached
          a frenzied pitch, Taylor shines a brilliant spotlight to dispel the
          darkness!”<br /><b>— Angelina Heart</b>, the author of
          <i>The Teaching of Little Crow</i><br /><br />“Who is the gatekeeper
          of your mind? If you aren’t consciously vigilant in managing your
          thoughts and deliberately manifesting a life of high self-esteem,
          abundance, rich and loving relationships, happiness, and fulfillment,
          you’re allowing others to pollute your mind and diminish the quality
          of your life in all areas. Dr. Eldon Taylor’s brilliant book
          <i>Mind Programming</i> will educate you on the dangers of having your
          mind manipulated by others and show you all the ways to champion your
          mind and your life. Read this book to take control of your mind and
          all aspects of your life, and to create your compelling future on
          purpose.”<br /><b>— Dr. Joe Rubino,</b> founder,
