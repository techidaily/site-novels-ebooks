          <p>
            I have had an awareness growing up about myself and my surrounding.
            This awareness led me to ask questions. Answers came in the form of
            people, experiences, tests, and sometimes trial and error. Living my
            life for half a century in this quantum body has gifted me with the
            wisdom to navigate life with a strategy that is beneficial for the
            natural progression of life and its universal laws. Hence this book
            is the catharsis of my soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rhythm of my life started at a faster pace when I came to the
            United States (US) in 1992 at an early age, soon after an arranged
            marriage. I was born and raised as an orthodox Muslim in Karachi,
            Pakistan. Upon my arrival in Los Angeles, CA, I couldn't speak
            English, nor did I have any financial means. Being new to a country
            like the United States felt like being on a new planet to me, and
            complicated by the fact that I accompanied a man I barely knew.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Life took a path that has been full of hard lessons, emotionally
            challenging experiences, roadblocks, and cultural and language
            barriers.
          </p>

            >How did I come this far despite my conservative upbringing?</strong
          ><strong
            >How did I break through all the cultural, social, and religious
            barriers?</strong
          ><strong
            >How did I stay strong through the storms and come all this way far
            enough to touch the star? To live in a world where science fiction
            is becoming a reality.</strong
          ><strong
            >How did I navigate my life to draw happiness and
            independence?</strong
          >
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This book shares wisdom via storytelling to help you come out of
            trenches no matter how deep the hole is.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This book will enhance your understanding of the Quantum humans we
            are, and how living by the principle of Quantum Physics, everyone
            can choose a life path and career path that perfectly aligns with
            their goals and personality.

            <strong>This book bridges science and spirituality</strong>&nbsp;and
            helps you see the truth for yourself by showing you the magnificent
            interconnectedness we have all around us and within us guiding our
            pathway to our true self, home, and final destiny.

          "I have known Shehnaz Soni as a work colleague at NASA's Marshall
          Space Flight Center for four years. We became close friends over this
          time. You will discover in reading this book that Shehnaz is a fierce
          seeker of knowledge. She is admired by all her co-workers as an
          articulate aerospace engineer. I admire her ability to put into print
          her very personal experiences of seeking and discovering a more
          fulfilling life. She is full of enthusiasm. She is a woman who is as
          beautiful inside as the beautiful woman you see. It is amazing to read
          of a woman facing so many life challenges and continually choosing
          paths that bring her into victorious living. She has turned her "ashes
          into gold." She is truly a "life coach." A woman of "true grit" who
          takes irritations of life and makes pearls of them."

          "Thank you, Shehnaz, for holding courage and sharing your story in a
          way that entices one's consciousness into the realm of "infinite
          possibilities." Your words will surely encourage a multitude of souls
          to dream of a future today worthy of our divine existence."

          may have a new calling in writing. Having met you in person and
          getting to know you and where you are now makes me appreciate how one
          can overcome and prevail despite many struggles and obstacles in life,
          the like of which you endured and conquered. Hats off to you, and big
          kudos for a wonderful and enthralling book, many will truly be
