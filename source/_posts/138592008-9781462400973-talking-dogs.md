            Dog lovers of all stripes will enjoy the captivating stories of the
            authors pets, and his thoughtful musings about them and their lives
            with him and his family. Convinced that his pooches have all been
            blessings from God, Sam further sees the Creator using them to
            graphically illustrate vital life principles. In Talking Dogs those
            principles emerge from a new perspective as you catch an
            over-the-shoulder view of Sams experiences with his beloved furry
            companions, and the wonderful Scriptural insights that have flowed
            from those relationships.

            Every pet lover will enjoy this great book by my friend Sam Mason.
            Its a page-turner filled with refreshing scriptural insights on
            living the life God wants each of us to enjoy.

            This book is full of great lessons about how the way dogs interact
            with us can teach us about our relationship with God. I really
            enjoyed reading it. Im not aware of any other book like this. As a
            great dog lover all my life, I highly recommend Talking Dogs.

            As I read Sams book I was reminded of a line from the greatest of
            all dog book authors Albert Payson Terhune. Terhune said that humans
            were unlucky because they didnt see their God until they died while
            a dog saw his god each time he looked into his masters face. This
            book might just help you find a deeper relationship with God by
            getting to better know Him through the canines He sends into your
            life. I know that has been true for me.
