          <p><strong>About The Book:</strong></p>
          <p>
            Count the Cost has been given to me to write by god himself during
            seven days off fasting with just water I had hurt myself in an
            accident and was home following doctors order when one evening, the
            lord said to go into fasting for seven days, with just water he said
            water is your food I was instructed to do so it came to me the
            second day during the fasting to start to write this was not
            something that I had done before so I ponder in my heart what, I was
            going to write about what came in my head was two words the cost I
            write it on the paper and started writing about some little though
            that were going through my head but it was not making any sense, so
            I said, lord what should I write about and he said to tell them
            about my love, and so, He started to talk to me and whatever he said
            I write it in the book it went on like that for about two weeks and
            then He said, I stop talking do you that was his exact word so I
            stop writing and that is how the book came about written by god
            himself for you like john in the book of revelation. I am just the
            one he us to write it in a book. I am just a servant that does what
            his master told him to do. Jesus wrote this book for you because he
            loves us so much. The book is an invitation to us to come to heaven.
