            >Traces the history of good fortune traditions from sacred
            divination to modern gambling</b
          ><br /><br />• Reveals how dice were originally considered sacred
          objects of divination and details the techniques and meanings of a
          dice oracle<br /><br />• Looks at medieval grimoires for
          fortune-telling and other divination traditions, including those using
          cowrie shells, bones, coins, cards, sticks, and stones<br /><br />•
          Examines how dice became a means of gaming and gambling and how
          gambling gave rise to specialized lucky charms<br /><br />Some believe
          that our future is predetermined, while others assert that we have
          free will and our future can take many different courses depending on
          our actions. In ancient times, it was believed that the will of the
          gods determined people’s lives, and divination or sacrifices to the
          gods could change or improve one’s future. Of the deities devoted to
          luck and the future, the Roman goddess Fortuna is most famous, having
          two shrines in Italy where divination was conducted under her
          guardianship. <br /><br />Tracing the history of the culture of good
          fortune from sacred divination to profane gambling, Nigel Pennick
          explores the many ways people through the centuries have sought to
          divine the future, ensure protection, and draw the full benefits from
          days of good omen. He shows how dice were originally considered sacred
          objects of divination and reveals the divinatory geomancy techniques
          and meanings of a dice oracle. Exploring how dice became a means of
          gaming and gambling, Pennick details the forms of trickery and crooked
          dice used in games of craps by cheating gamblers and the Dream Books
          that served as oracles for those who played the policy game. In
          addition to dice, he looks at how cowrie shells, bones, coins, cards,
          sticks, and stones were used to form meaningful patterns for
          interpretation and how these cultural divination practices were often
          accompanied by texts or oral traditions that explained the meanings of
          the patterns. <br /><br />Revealing how divination and gambling are
          two sides of the same coin, Pennick shows how, whether you are a
          gambler relying on Lady Luck or a diviner querying the gods, we’re all
          looking to Fortuna in the quest for a better, richer life.

        <p>
          “Pennick begins with a near-poetic overview of the human condition as
          stuck in a merciless complexity of variables on a celestial omnibus
          with a one-way driver: time. With his characteristic clarity of
          observation and attention to detail, he serves as a brilliant tour
          guide through the infinite continuum of attempts to quell the anxiety
          of the murky uncertainty of the journey. Persistent among these seek
          the intercession of goddess Fortuna/Lady Luck, their minions and
          practitioners, purporting to speak through the language of the
          universe—numbers. This is an entertaining and thoughtful book— and
          even offers several DIY prognostication techniques used over time to
          (possibly) help readers’ navigate life decisions.”
