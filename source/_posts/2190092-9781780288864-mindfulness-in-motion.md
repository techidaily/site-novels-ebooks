            >Discover a life of ease and joy through Body in Mind Training, a
            groundbreaking program focused on movement-based mindfulness</b
          ><br /><br />Written by neuroscientist and mindfulness expert Dr.
          Tamara Russell, <i>Mindfulness in Motion</i> presents a new approach
          to mindfulness that is practiced not by sitting still but by engaging
          with the moving body. It is the only book to explain why moving
          meditation is the best way of ‘rewiring’ the brain, teaching it to
          focus on the present moment. Russell's simple exercises are designed
          to be accessible to everyone, including those who can’t seem to find
          time for practice, and those who have struggled with&nbsp;traditional
          Zen-inspired mindfulness.<br /><br />This book will guide you step by
          step through Dr. Tamara Russell’s Body in Mind Training (BMT) program,
          a unique approach to secular mindfulness that uses the moving body as
          the main meditation tool. The message is simple: getting out of your
          head and into your body is the key to a happier, healthier life.
          Chapter by chapter, the book explores the five principles of
          movement-based mindfulness:<br /><br />•<b>&nbsp;Pause:&nbsp;</b>In
          order to hear your body, you have to slow down and listen to its
          voice—this is the starting point for BMT mindfulness practice.<br />•
          <b>Intention:</b>&nbsp;Setting your intention before you act can
          dramatically increase your ability to achieve what you want in
          life.<br />•&nbsp;<b>Attention:</b> You can detect the mind-wandering
          habits that hold you back and use your attention to create more space
          for the things that really matter.<br />•&nbsp;<b>Understanding Me:</b
          >&nbsp;It’s possible to tame your unruly ‘mental monkeys’ and create
          new neural pathways in your brain to help you to realize your full
          potential.<br />•&nbsp;<b>Compassion:</b>&nbsp;Facing and accepting
          your own difficult experiences can profoundly transform your
          relationship with life.<br /><br />With easy-to-follow exercises,
          step-by-step photographs, clear brain diagrams, and a host of
          practical tips, this book offers all the tools you need to start
          living in your body. With a little focus, determination, and practice,
          you too can experience the amazing benefits of mindfulness.
