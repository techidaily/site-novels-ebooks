          <p>
            Quareia the Adept Book Fifteen is the last one of fifteen workbooks
            containing two modules each.&nbsp;Book Fifteen covers modules nine
            and ten, the final book from the Adept section of Quareia, and the
            end of the course: Teaching, Mentoring and Group Construction, and
            The True Adept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The full section of the Quareia Adept which includes all ten modules
            is also available in paperback and hardback forms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The course is spread over three sections: Apprentice, Initiate, and
            Adept. Each section has ten modules, and each module has eight
            lessons. Each of the three sections is approximately five hundred
            thousand words: it is the most extensive, in-depth, and intelligent
            up to date magical course that is currently available worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methods, information and techniques in the course enable the
            magician to engage any form of magic and work with it appropriately
            with the full knowledge of how that magic works, why it works and
            what is behind it. It also starts to guide the magician along the
            mystical path, a path that reaches beyond religions and faith, and
            one where the adept moves into mystical union with the universe
            around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lessons are detailed: each lesson has a very practical
            application which in turn develops the ‘magical muscle’ within the
            magician, thus preparing them for the power they will be exposed to
            in subsequent study sections. It is not reference material or
            'recipe magic' that can be dipped in and out of: the understanding
            of the foundations comes from the dovetailing, study, and layering
            of magic that forms within and around the apprentice. It is designed
            to be self-taught, with every detail and step assigned carefully and
            practically. By the end of this section, the apprentice will have
            all of the skills, knowledge and strength to take on the challenge
            of the next stage of training.
          </p>

            The Quareia course is written in its entirety by magical adept and
            the Director of Quareia, Josephine McCarthy. Josephine has been
            involved in magic for forty years and has been teaching and writing
            about magic for over twenty five years. She is considered a
            revolutionizing force in the teaching of western magic, and one of
            the most prominent adepts of western magic alive today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quareia is a school that is open to anyone, and is free and
            accessible online at any time. It is a school that is entirely
            focused on teaching the most essential skills in magic, with unknown
            precision and depth in its materials. Yet it is free from any
            specific one style or specific religious overlay: various styles and
            religious patterns are studied and at times worked with in depth,
            but there is no one creed, culture or system that forms the
            foundation basis of the training: it is itself.
