          When actor Christopher Reeve was asked in a BBC interview which book
          he would want if stranded on a desert island, he replied, "<i
            >The Inner Reality</i
          >
          by the philosopher Paul Brunton."<br /><br />
          A provocative and compelling work, <i>The Inner Reality </i>is an
          essential guide for spiritual seekers. First published in the 1930s,
          this remarkable book interweaves the teachings of two great religious
          figures: Jesus and Krishna. Identifying a common current running
          through both Christianity and Hinduism, Paul Brunton argues that an
          "inner reality" or "kingdom of heaven" can be found within each of us.
          Defining religion as simply the practice of binding oneself with
          divinity, he encourages readers to embark on the quest for
          self-knowledge and spiritual communion through a commitment to the
          contemplative path. With his profound interpretations of the world's
          sacred texts, from the Gospel of St. John to the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>,
          Brunton bridges East and West to guide the reader into the living
          heart of these ancient traditions. <br /><br />
          This new edition has been updated to incorporate the author's final
          revisions and includes a foreword by the Paul Brunton Philosophic
          Foundation.

          “Paul Brunton was surely one of the finest mystical flowers to grow on
          the wasteland of our secular civilization. What he has to say is
          important to us all.”&nbsp;<br />—Georg Feuerstein, author of
          <i
            >The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and
            Practice</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “[Paul Brunton is] a person of rare intelligence … thoroughly alive,
          and whole in the most significant, ‘holy’ sense of the word.”
          <br />—<i>Yoga Journal&nbsp;<br /></i><br />“An uncommonly interesting
          volume by one of the leading exponents of the Yoga Philosophy to the
          Western world. The author gives an entirely new interpretation of the
          Seven Beatitudes, and a most illuminating exposition of the life of
          Jesus during the years between childhood and maturity...”<br />—<i
            >Johannesburg Sunday Times</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This is in some ways the most helpful and practical of the books of
          this popular writer of mysticism. Brunton's presentation of his
          methods is clear and reasonable.”<br />—<i
            >The Knoxville News-Sentinel</i
          >
          [Tennessee]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Paul Brunton, who has taken upon himself the task of explaining yoga
          philosophy to the West, has produced <i>The Inner Reality</i> which is
          a further step on the path to a deeper revelation of the true meaning
          of yoga.”<br />—<i>Illustrated Weekly of India</i> [Bombay]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>The Inner Realty</i> is one of those delightful books.… Its chief
          asset is a profound simplicity, which leads you all the while nearer
          to a more complete understand of man and the universe. There is not a
          dull page and hardly a paragraph that does not sparkle with some gem
          of truth. How much the modern world needs those words when hatred and
          fear and suspicion are poisoning the minds and corrupting the hearts
          of men.”<br />—<i>The Two Worlds</i> [Manchester, England]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Rather astounding doctrine this to come from one wholly sold on the
          idea of Yoga. A mingling of the mystical and material is what Paul
          Brunton pleads for.… No book can assist more in this search than Mr.
          Brunton's Discover Yourself.”<br />—<i>Sutton Place</i> magazine&nbsp;

        </h4>
        <p>
          Paul Brunton (1898–1981) is one of the twentieth century's most
          brilliant spiritual writers. Generally recognized as having introduced
          yoga and meditation to the West, he was the most popular and
          authoritative source of information on Eastern philosophies, gurus,
          and meditation systems from the mid-'30s to the '60s. His books have
          sold over two million copies in seventeen languages. In 1954, he
          withdrew from public life and continued writing the material that was
          posthumously published as <i>The Notebooks of Paul Brunton</i>--a
          truly East-West spiritual philosophy. Written with the passion of an
          authentic pioneer and the thoughtfulness of a seasoned practitioner,
          his work is re-emerging as a beacon for all contemporary seekers.
