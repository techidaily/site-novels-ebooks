          Jane Palzere and Anna Brown met while attending a class in spiritual
          development.&nbsp; Jane was working in a hospital and Anna was a
          teacher in a middle school.&nbsp; When the class ended, they said
          goodbye never expecting to meet again.Feeling an unrest and
          dissatisfaction with the way her life was going, Jane increased her
          efforts to find a new direction.&nbsp; The search for meaning led her
          from church to church and from lecture to lecture. &nbsp;Jane was
          involved with meditation, prayer and classes in spiritual
          exercises.&nbsp; She decided to try fasting as a means of
          strengthening her discipline.&nbsp; At this point, the letters began
          to arrive.&nbsp; Jane was surprised by their appearance and even more
          so when she was told that she would work with Anna Brown and that
          these letters were to be published in book form.The letters themselves
          caused a great deal of soul searching and self analysis.&nbsp; At
          first, they were met with skepticism, fear, questions,
          disbelief.&nbsp; As mentors appeared who encouraged the sharing of the
          letters, they were able to accept what was happening.By a series of
          events and circumstances which propelled the book forward the book
          went into several printings and was used in classes and seminars.Anna
          passed away in 2005.&nbsp; Jane continues to believe in the love of
          God and the workings of spirit.

        <p>
          When faced with the business of growing up and investigating life and
          its mysteries, Jane Palzere embarked on a spiritual journey hoping to
          find answers. &nbsp; She enrolled in development classes, seminars,
          workshops always looking for the one path that would lead to the final
          truth. &nbsp; She joined Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship where she was
          introduced to many great teachers like Leo Buscaglia, Deepak Chapra,
          Father Diorio and many others.&nbsp; After many experiences and
          teachers, she came to realize that all paths are the same and all
          paths lead to God.&nbsp; During this period, she came into contact
          with a "voice" which spoke to her about the mysteries of healing and
          spiritual living.&nbsp; She kept these notes in a journal and decided
          they were messages that should be shared.&nbsp; With the help of a
          friend, she published a small booklet, which went into three
          printings.&nbsp; Jane continues to believe in the love of God and the
          workings of spirit.
