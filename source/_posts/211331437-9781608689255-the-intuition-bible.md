            >What if there is a way to tap into a well of knowledge to guide you
            on life’s journey?<br />
            What if you could cut through the constant barrage of conflicting
            and overwhelming information?</strong
          ><br />
          <br />
          Each of us possesses an innate source of guidance: our power of
          intuition. Unfortunately, we are rarely trained to tap into this
          wisdom, and it’s often misunderstood. Author Happy Ali aims to change
          that.<br />
          <br />
          Presenting insights into the inner workings of the universe, inspiring
          true stories, and simple experiments, Happy shows how we can all
          access and use this marvelous way to find clarity amid the chaos.
          Intuition helped Happy anticipate his own successes (and tragedies),
          equipping him for the joys and challenges that awaited him. The
          Intuition Bible presents the approach he has taught thousands of
          seekers, which includes:<br />
          <br />
          • reasons and remedies for blockages and misinterpretations<br />
          • how to understand dreams, vibrations, chakras, and energy<br />
          • a range of techniques, including simple-yet-powerful yes/no
          exercises, to assist in everyday decision-making and refine personal
          intuition<br />

          “Happy Ali shows us that life does, in fact, come with an instruction
          manual; it’s inside us, just waiting to be discovered. The Intuition
          Bible demystifies this inner wisdom and offers a direct path to an
          unlimited well of guidance within. With moving stories, profound
          insights, and simple-yet-powerful practices, Happy guides us out of
          the darkness we often find ourselves in and into the light and beauty
          of living in concert with our intuition.”<br />

          “The Intuition Bible by Happy Ali is an empowering book that uplifts,
          inspires, and teaches how to view life and one’s spiritual journey
          through a dynamic new perspective. His approach guides the reader to
          filter out the distractions of life in the twenty-first century in
          order to discover the power of silence and the wisdom of our inner
          self. This must-read book is destined to become a spiritual
          classic.”<br />

          natural gift of intuition, fostering complete trust in yourself.
          Through examples and exercises, Happy guides you on a transformative
          journey to discern your intuition with mastery.”<br />

            Unexpected, Signs from the Other Side, and Soul Searching<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “The Intuition Bible is just what the world needs right now. We are
          only beginning to fully understand the depths of the wisdom we hold
          within — information that every one of us has access to through our
          inner dimension. Science and mysticism are at last coming together,
          with all signs pointing to intuition as a key to unlocking the full
          potential of the human mind. Happy Ali skillfully articulates the
          workings of intuition and shows you how to infuse its power into your
          life. If you are ready to take your consciousness to the next level,
          this book will open doors to truths and realities you have never
          imagined.”<br />
          <strong>— Kim Chestney, author of The Illumination Code<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “In The Intuition Bible, Happy Ali reminds us of the power that lies
          in our connection to our inner knowing and guides us into a deeper,
          more open relationship with our ever-present intuition. With easy
          clarity and wisdom, Happy offers invaluable practices for going
          within, helping us get off auto-pilot and live with more intention and
          joy. The benefits of this profound and beautiful book are
          undeniable!”<br />
