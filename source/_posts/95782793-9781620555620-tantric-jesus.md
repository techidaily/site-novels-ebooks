          A guide to the history and modern practice of transformative
          Christianity <br />
          <br />• Reveals the original tantric wisdom of Jesus and the early
          Church and its resonance with the tantric yogas of India and Tibet
          <br />
          <br />• Explains how tantric Christianity views the human body as the
          primary “temple” of the Holy and erotic energy as the signature of
          indwelling Divine Presence <br />
          <br />• Provides step-by-step instructions for a series of Christian
          tantric practices, including a partnered sexual practice, mantra and
          energy work, eye gazing, and work with icons <br />
          <br />Unbeknownst to many, the original Christian spirituality as
          practiced in the early church and by Jesus himself was a tantric
          spirituality. In the West, Tantra often evokes images of arcane
          rituals or acrobatic sexual positions, while in reality Tantra is a
          holistic transformative path of life, love, and being--grounded in
          practice. <br />
          <br />Offering a new understanding of Jesus as guru and master of
          left-handed Tantra, James Reho, an Episcopal priest and tantric
          initiate, reframes the Christian story and restores to modern
          Christianity the tantric wisdom practices that were edited out of
          church tradition and forgotten over the centuries. He explains how
          tantric Christianity views the human body as the primary “temple” of
          the Holy, with erotic energy as the signature of Divine Presence
          within. Rev. Reho reveals the similarities of the earliest Christian
          practices to the tantric yogas of India and Tibet and explores the
          role of Kundalini and the chakras. He details how to work with
          mantras, icons, and pranayama breathing exercises, as well as with
          gazing as a spiritual practice. Informed by the insights of ancient
          texts and early masters of Christian spirituality, the author provides
          step-by-step instructions on how to practice Christian tantric sex
          with a life-partner of the opposite or same sex. <br />
          <br />Rev. Reho reveals how these heart-opening practices are rooted
          in eros, the life of deep desire, expressive of God’s grace within us,
          and are still alive in monastic practices in the Christian East.
          Integrating his personal spiritual experiences, years of study of
          ancient Christian mysticism, and an expertise in yoga and tantra, the
          author shows how we can re-engage the original truths of the early
          church to affirm the body as a holy vehicle and to utilize the energy
          of the erotic to achieve ecstatic union with the Divine.

          “With scholarship as thorough as its topic is controversial, Tantric
          Jesus infuses the traditions of Christianity with the embodied
          practices of Hindu Tantra. . . . Do the practices in this book, and
          your understanding of the historical Jesus and the path of
          Christianity will never be the same.”
