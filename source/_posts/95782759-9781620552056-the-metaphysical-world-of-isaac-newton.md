          Newton’s heretical yet equation-incisive writings on theology,
          spirituality, alchemy, and prophecy, written in secret alongside his
          <i>Principia Mathematica</i> <br /><br />• Shows how Newton’s
          brilliance extended far beyond math and science into alchemy,
          spirituality, prophecy, and the search for lost continents such as
          Atlantis <br /><br />• Explains how he was seeking to rediscover the
          one true religion that existed prior to the Flood of Noah, when
          science and spirituality were one <br /><br />• Examines Newton’s
          alternate timeline of prehistory and his study of prophecy through the
          Book of Revelations, including his prediction of Apocalypse in the
          year 2060 <br /><br />Isaac Newton (1643-1727) is still regarded by
          the world as the greatest scientist who ever lived. He invented
          calculus, discovered the binomial theorem, explained the rainbow,
          built the first reflecting telescope, and explained the force of
          gravity. In his famous masterpiece, <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, he
          described the mechanics of the physical universe with unimagined
          precision, proving the cosmos was put together according to laws. The
          perfection of these laws implied a perfect legislator. To Newton, they
          were proof that God existed. <br /><br />At the same time Newton was
          writing <i>Principia Mathematica</i>, he was writing a twin volume
          that he might have called, had it been completed,
          <i>Principia Theologia</i>--<i>Principles of Theology</i>. This other
          masterpiece of Newton, kept secret because of the heresies it
          contained, consists of thousands of essays providing equation-incisive
          answers to the spiritual questions that have plagued mankind through
          the ages. Examining Newton’s secret writings, John Chambers shows how
          his brilliance extended into alchemy, spirituality, the search for
          lost continents such as Atlantis, and a quest to uncover the
          “corrupted texts” that were rife in the Bibles of his time. Although
          he was a devout Christian, Newton’s work on the Bible was focused not
          on restoring the original Jewish and Christian texts but on
          rediscovering the one true religion that existed prior to the Flood of
          Noah, when science and spirituality were one. <br /><br />The author
          shows that a single thread runs through Newton’s metaphysical
          explorations: He is attempting to chart the descent of man’s soul from
          perfection to the present day. The author also examines Newton’s
          alternate timeline of ancient history and his study of prophecy
          through the Book of Revelations, including his prediction of an
          Apocalypse in the year 2060 followed by a radically transformed world.
          He shows that Newton’s great hope was that these writings would
          provide a moral compass for humanity as it embarked upon the great
          enterprise that became our technological world.

        <p>
          John Chambers has undertaken the valuable task of reemphasizing that a
          father of modern science had an open mind where alchemy was concerned
          and that Isaac Newton’s efforts to show a scientific rationale in the
          structure of the cosmos was driven by a desire to demonstrate as well
          as reveal it as the expression of divine intelligence, mystical but
          rationally intelligible, and not an accident of random numbers subject
          to chance. Newton was looking seriously for meaning, something modern
          scientists often consider beyond their remit.”
