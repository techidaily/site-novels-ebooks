              empowering guide to true, holistic healing. </b
            ><br /><br /><br />In <i>Heal from Within</i>, internationally
            recognized medical intuitive and licensed professional counselor
            Katie Beecher shares a revolutionary, step-by-step approach to
            physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Using some of the same
            tools and exercises that Katie uses in her acclaimed medical and
            spiritual intuitive readings, the reader will be taught how to
            access their own intuition and spiritual guidance as they move
            towards healing that encompasses body, mind, and soul.<br /><br /><br />With
            information from her spiritual guides and thirty years of
            experience, Katie guides readers to inventory their physical and
            emotional health, identify their key issues and the possible
            emotional, physical and spiritual contributing factors, then develop
            a strategy to permanently heal the root causes. The book includes
            inspirational stories about Katie’s discovery and development of her
            spiritual abilities and healing from an eating disorder, depression,
            trauma and Lyme disease as well as detailed accounts of the healing
            journeys of many of her clients. The second part of the book
            includes a comprehensive glossary of specific conditions along with
            tailored treatment suggestions.<br /><br /><br />Filled with
            practical advice—from suggestions for supplements to exercises,
            mantras, and dialogue prompts —<i>Heal from Within</i> empowers
            readers to confidently take control of their own wellness and become
            their own medical intuitive.
