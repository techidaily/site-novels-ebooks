        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Growing up, <b>Jessica Sanders</b> was always the tallest student in
          her class, and struggled to accept and love her body. When she was 12,
          her mother signed her up to play volleyball knowing her height would
          be celebrated and an advantage. Jessica soon learned that different
          bodies brought different skills to the team and all these bodies were
          valued. After leaving high-school, Jessica travelled solo to many
          countries and climbed some of the world’s highest mountains, always
          carrying a heavy pack that made her grateful for her strong body. Over
          time, and through the ups and downs of life's tough lessons, Jessica
          grew to love and celebrate her body. Inspired by her own journey,
          Jessica wrote <i>Love Your Body</i> to educate and empower young girls
          with the message of self-love.<br /><br />
          Jessica&nbsp;is an author, advocate, and social worker. She has
          volunteered for several women’s rights organizations, supported women
          and children fleeing family violence, climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in
          alliance with African women fighting for their rights to land, and
          lectured at schools teaching the importance of respect for self and
          others. Currently Jessica works at the Butterfly Foundation where she
          educates young people on the importance of positive body image.
