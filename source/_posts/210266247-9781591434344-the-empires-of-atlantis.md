          • Traces the course of Atlantean civilization through its three
          empires, as well as the colonies and outposts formed by its survivors
          in Egypt, Göbekli Tepe, India, Mesopotamia, the Mediterranean, and
          North and South America <br /><br />• Shows how pyramids and other
          megalithic monuments testify to the survival of a “Sacred Science” of
          Atlantean origin and how this Sacred Science provided the foundation
          for esoteric traditions and secret societies throughout the ages
          <br /><br />• Draws on more than 500 ancient and modern sources and
          the author’s own personal exploration of hundreds of archaeological
          sites <br /><br />Exploring more than 100,000 years of Earth’s
          history, Marco Vigato combines recent discoveries in the the fields of
          archaeology, geology, anthropology, and genetics with the mystery
          teachings of antiquity to investigate the true origins of
          civilization. Establishing the historical and geological reality of
          Atlantis stretching all the way back to 432,000 BCE, he traces the
          course of Atlantean civilization through its three empires, revealing
          how civilization rose and fell several times over this lengthy span of
          time. <br /><br />The author shows that Atlantis did not vanish “in
          one terrible day and night” but survived in a variety of different
          forms well into the historical era. He reveals how the the first
          Atlantean civilization lasted from 432,000 to 35,335 BCE, the second
          one from 21,142 to 10,961 BCE, and the third Atlantis
          civilization--the one celebrated by Plato--collapsed in 9600 BCE,
          after the Younger Dryas cataclysm. The author examines the role of
          Atlantean survivors in restarting civilization in different parts of
          the world, from Göbekli Tepe and Egypt to India, Mesopotamia, and the
          Americas. He personally documents their colonies and outposts around
          the globe, offering unique views of the colossal network of pyramids,
          earthen mounds, and other megalithic monuments they le behind. He
          shows how these monuments testify to the survival of a sacred science
          of Atlantean origin, and he documents the survival of the primeval
          Atlantean tradition through various secret societies into the modern
          era. <br /><br />Drawing on more than 500 ancient and modern sources
          and sharing never-before-seen photographs from his own personal
          exploration of hundreds of archaeological sites around the world,
          Vigato shows not only that Atlantis was real but that the whole world
          is now being called to become a New Atlantis and awaken into a new
          golden age.
