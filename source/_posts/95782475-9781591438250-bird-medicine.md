          Explores the living spiritual tradition surrounding birds in Native
          American culture <br />
          <br />• Pairs scholarly research with more than 200 firsthand accounts
          of bird signs from traditional Native Americans and their descendants
          <br />
          <br />• Examines the legends, wisdom, and powers of the birds known as
          the gatekeepers of the four directions—Eagle, Hawk, Crow, and Owl
          <br />
          <br />• Provides many examples of bird sign interpretations and
          human-bird communication that can be applied in your own encounters
          with birds <br />
          <br />Birds are our strongest allies in the natural world. Revered in
          Native American spirituality and shamanic traditions around the world,
          birds are known as teachers, guardians, role models, counselors,
          healers, clowns, peacemakers, and meteorologists. They carry messages
          and warnings from loved ones and the spirit world, report deaths and
          injuries, and channel divine intelligence to answer our questions.
          Some of their “signs” are so subtle that one could discount them as
          subjective, but others are dramatic enough to strain even a skeptic’s
          definition of coincidence. <br />
          <br />Pairing scholarly research with more than 200 firsthand accounts
          of bird encounters from traditional Native Americans and their
          descendants, Evan Pritchard explores the living spiritual tradition
          surrounding birds in Native American culture. He examines in depth the
          birds known as the gatekeepers of the four directions--Eagle in the
          North, Hawk in the East, Crow in the South, and Owl in the
          West--including their roles in legends and the use of their feathers
          in shamanic rituals. He reveals how the eagle can be a direct
          messenger of the Creator, why crows gather in “Crow Councils,” and how
          shamans have the ability to travel inside of birds, even after death.
          Expanding his study to the wisdom and gifts of birds beyond the four
          gatekeepers, such as hummingbirds, seagulls, and the mythical
          thunderbird, he provides numerous examples of everyday bird sign
          interpretations that can be applied in your own encounters with birds
          as well as ways we can help protect birds and encourage them to
          communicate with us.

          “<i>Bird Medicine</i> is wise, informative, folksy, and eminently
          readable. The narratives are clear and detailed, and Mr. Pritchard,
          noted scholar and author on Native American cultures, has the
          credibility to present them, being both a traditional ‘insider’ and an
          accredited Western scholar. Even more important, this volume fills a
          major gap in our knowledge of the natural myths of the Americas. I can
          see this book becoming required reading for secondary schools all over
          the country.”
