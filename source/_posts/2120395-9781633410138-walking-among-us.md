              >“<i>Walking Among Us</i> explains why extraterrestrial UFOs are
              here, who is aboard them, and what they are doing. If enough of us
              read and pay attention to the evidence in this book, we might be
              able to avoid the disaster that its evidence portends.”—Don C.
              Donderi, PhD, associate professor (retired) of psychology, McGill
              University, Montreal, author of UFOs, ETs, and Alien Abductions</b
            ><br /><br />In his earlier book, The Threat, Jacobs uncovered
            disconcerting reports about aliens' plans for the future of Earth.
            He reported that a "change" is coming; a future when very humanlike
            hybrids would intermingle with humans in everyday life. "Soon we
            will all be together," the aliens said. "Soon everyone will be happy
            and everyone will know his place."<br /><br />Walking Among Us
            examines a disturbing phenomenon that Jacobs began noticing in 2003.
            The alien integration action plan has kicked into high gear. The
            incidents of alien abductions have accelerated as have occurrences
            of alien involvement in everyday human life. A silent and insidious
            invasion has begun. Alien hybrids have moved into your neighborhood
            and into your workplace. They have been trained by human abductees
            to "pass," to blend in to society, to appear as normal as your next
            door neighbor.<br /><br />This book illustrates in detail the
            process of alien integration into society and the strategy and
            support structure that has been developed to make this happen
            seamlessly. While he is not certain why they are doing it, the final
            chapter of the book will provide some chilling possible answers as
            to why they are here and what they want to accomplish.<br /><br />Jacobs
            is a careful researcher who has investigated more than 1150
            abduction events experienced by more than 150 abductees. This book
            focuses on the experiences of thirteen abductees.

          “<i>Walking Among Us</i> is a chronicle of human experience that
          contradicts every current theory about the universe that we think we
          live in. Jacobs’ human observers have experienced a concealed reality
          that is literally next door to some of us, and that he believes is
          about to interact, secretly and insidiously, with the rest of us.
          <i>Walking Among Us</i> explains why extraterrestrial UFOs are here,
          who is aboard them, and what they are doing. To put it mildly, the
          evidence from the people that Jacobs has interviewed shows that the
          extraterrestrials are up to no good. You will find
          <i>Walking Among Us</i> hard to put down. If enough of us read and pay
          attention to the evidence in this book, we might be able to avoid the
          disaster that its evidence portends.” —<b>Don C. Donderi, PhD</b>,
