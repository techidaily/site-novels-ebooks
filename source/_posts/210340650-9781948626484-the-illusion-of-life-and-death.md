            From ancient sages, spiritual teachers such as the Buddha,
            philosophers including Plato and Seneca to modern-day quantum
            physicists, life-long student of religions and spiritual traditions,
            philosophy and quantum physics, Clare Goldsberry, walks us through
            the mystery of death and dying, as well as the questions of the
            meaning and purpose of life. With her insights as a Buddhist
            practitioner and teacher, student of Hinduism, as well as the
            journey of the cancer diagnosis of her significant other and his
            death, she provides a unique view into living and dying as seen
            through the ages from those who’ve sought answers into this most
            mysterious of experiences—this thing we call death.

          “Clare Goldsberry’s book
          <i
            >The Illusion of Life and Death: Mind, Consciousness, and Eternal
            Being</i
          >
          will help any reader to move from fear of death toward freedom. Coming
          from a Christian background, Goldsberry’s search about the meaning of
          life led her to the timeless Eastern teachings of Hinduism and
          Buddhism. She has also discovered deep parallel insights in the
          teachings of the Christ and the Jewish mystics. Highly recommended.”

          ><br /><br />"<i>The Illusion of Life and Death</i> is a wonderful
          book for anyone who is afraid of dying. Clare Goldsberry has woven a
          great deal of contemporary research with ancient spiritual traditions,
          mainly Buddhism and Hinduism as well as the words of mystics and
          sages, leaving the reader with more courage to face their own death.
          Her book literally dispels the illusion of life and death."

          ><br /><br />"How we approach death can greatly affect how we live.
          The fear of losing loved ones can be stultifying, but the truth is
          that we will all experience just that, and in our own passing we will
          cause grief and pain to those we leave behind. That is why books like
          The Illusion of Life and Death are so important, bringing wisdom and
          vital perspective, as well as comfort. Some of the most important
          lessons in life are about overcoming the fear of death, accepting the
          inevitability of it, and evolving how you think about it. Let this
          book be your guide on the journey.”
