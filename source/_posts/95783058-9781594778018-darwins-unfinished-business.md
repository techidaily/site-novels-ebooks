          A groundbreaking interpretation of evolution as the work of Nature’s
          intelligence <br />
          <br />• Refutes the orthodox view of evolution as a mindless process
          driven by chance <br />
          <br />• Explains why context is more important than mutation in
          evolutionary innovation <br />
          <br />• Shows how, by recognizing Nature’s innovative and creative
          powers, we can overcome our social and environmental challenges with a
          new green science of evolution <br />
          <br />Darwin’s theory of evolution is undoubtedly one of the most
          important scientific ideas of the modern age, explaining the existence
          of both life and consciousness without recourse to divine
          intervention. Yet how do we <i>interpret</i> evolution? How do we
          evaluate the ability of Nature to engineer something as exquisite as
          the genetic code or the human brain? Could it be that evolution is an
          intelligent process? Is Nature smart? According to most scientists,
          the answer is no. While humanity may be intelligent and purposeful,
          the natural processes that crafted us are deemed to be devoid of such
          attributes. <br />
          <br />In a radical move away from orthodoxy, Simon G. Powell extends
          Darwin’s vision by showing that evolution is not just about the
          survival of the fittest but rather the survival of clever and sensible
          behavior. Revealing the importance of the context in which things
          evolve, he explores the intelligent learning process behind natural
          selection. Rich with examples of the incredibly complex plants,
          animals, insects, and marine life designed by Nature--from the
          carnivorous Venus flytrap and the fungus-farming leafcutter ant to the
          symbiotic microbes found inside the common cow--he shows Nature as a
          whole to be a system of self-organizing intelligence in which life and
          consciousness were always destined to emerge. Examining the origins of
          life and the failure of artificial intelligence to compete with
          natural intelligence, he explains how our scientifically narrow-minded
          views on intelligence are now acting as a barrier to our own
          evolution. As Darwin’s unfinished business comes to light and Nature’s
          intelligence is embraced, we learn that Nature’s agenda is not simply
          the replication of genetic matter but of expanding consciousness. By
          working with Nature’s creative and innovative powers instead of
          against them, we can address today’s social and environmental
          challenges with a new green science of evolution.

          “Simon G. Powell forcefully but gently demonstrates that intelligence
          (modes of being that acquire information, learn, and meaningfully
          respond to larger contexts) is intrinsic to our natural world. People
          who deny the intelligence of the living (microbes, plants, other
          animals) are abysmally, indeed dangerously, ignorant. They literally
          ignore our ultimate, planetwide sources of joy, air, water, food, and
          energy. Read this informative, science-packed, yet accessible book and
          enjoy its wisdom.”
