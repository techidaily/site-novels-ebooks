            >Existential and curiously hypnotic, Pablo d'Ors evokes the sharp
            stylized prose of Bolaño, Bernhard, and DeLillo in this strange tale
            of one man's repeated forays into the desert, and the ultimate
            silence it contains.</b
          ><br /><br />"Thanks to the back cover of a book I knew that there
          lived in Brno a man who had dedicated a good portion of his life to
          traveling through many of the world's deserts." So begins Pavel's
          story, as a series of mysterious circumstances lead him to change the
          course of his life. On his repeated trips to the Sahara, first as part
          of an enigmatic organization called Friends of the Desert and later on
          his own, Pavel explores the drifting sands, and, ultimately, something
          approaching infinity. Nothing is as it seems. As the unknowns
          increase, each encounter presents a new mirror for Pavel's own
          expanding consciousness. <br /><br />Innumerable artists, thinkers,
          and mystics have paid their respects to the void. With refinement and
          care, <i>Friend of the Desert</i> inserts itself to that tradition. In
          the wake of Hesse's famous <i>Siddhartha</i>, Bolaño's
          <i>By Night in Chile</i>, and Don DeLillo's <i>The Names</i>, Pablo
          d'Ors approaches the depths and casually settles in.
          <i>Friend of the Desert </i>is a rare gift for seekers of the
          absolute.

          “A sublime performance. At the outset&nbsp;<i
            >The Friend of the Desert</i
          >&nbsp;occupies the beguiling territory of Robert Walser, Jane Bowles,
          or Georges Perec, but soon develops an allegorical intensity all its
          own; as it reaches its remarkable climax, each gesture seems to stand
          absolutely for itself, and also for the reader’s unnameable desires.”

        <p>
          Pablo d'Ors is a Spanish priest and writer. He was born in Madrid in
          1963 and educated in New York, Vienna, Prague, and Rome. He was
          ordained in 1991 and he received a doctorate in theology in 1996. In
          2014, he founded the Amigos del Desierto foundation with the aim of
          promoting the practice of meditation. In the same year, Pope Francis
          made him a consultant of the Pontifical Council for Culture. d'Ors
          debuted as a writer in 2000 with <i>El estreno</i>, a critically
          acclaimed collection of short stories. His essay
          <i>Biografía del silencio</i> was a publishing phenomenon in Spain,
          selling 130,000 copies in just a few years, and was published in
          English in 2018. Pablo d'Ors has gone on to publish almost a dozen
          fiction and nonfiction titles, which have been translated into French,
          German, Italian, Portuguese, and other languages. This is his first
          English fiction translation.
