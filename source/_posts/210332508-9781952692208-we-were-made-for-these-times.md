            challenges with wisdom, resilience, and ease.</b
          ><br /><br />We all go through times when it feels like the ground is
          being pulled out from under us. What we relied on as steady and solid
          may change or even appear to vanish. In this era of global disruption,
          threats to our individual, social, and planetary safety abound, and at
          times life can feel overwhelming.&nbsp;Not only are loss and
          separation painful, but even positive changes can cause great
          stress.&nbsp;<br /><br />Yet life is full of change: birth, death,
          marriage, divorce; a new relationship; losing or starting a job;
          beginning a new phase in life or ending one. Change is stressful, even
          when it is much desired or anticipated—the unknown can feel scary and
          threatening.&nbsp;In <i>We Were Made for These Times, </i>the
          extraordinary mindfulness teacher Kaira Jewel Lingo
          imparts&nbsp;accessible advice on navigating difficult times of
          transition,&nbsp;drawing on Buddhist teachings on impermanence to help
          you establish equanimity and resilience.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Each
          chapter in <i>We Were Made for These Times </i>holds an essential
          teaching and meditation, unfolding a step-by-step process to nurture
          deeper freedom and stability in daily life. Time-honored teachings
          will help you develop ease, presence, and self-compassion, supporting
          you to release the fear and doubt that hold you back.&nbsp;
