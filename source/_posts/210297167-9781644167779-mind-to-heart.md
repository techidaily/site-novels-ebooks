            Mind to Heart first became a reality in 2013. Faced with the
            devastating loss of her beloved grandfather followed by a job layoff
            two months later, Andrea had to develop a healthy way to deal with
            the shift in the trajectory of her complicated and seemingly
            unsteady life, so she began writing. It began as a simple way of
            encouraging others through her heartache. The writings have been
            nicknamed as AMTs over the years. AMTs are short messages of hope
            that are shared with others as a way to offer encouragement that is
            inspired straight from God. These messages always include a
            scripture to validate the topic and to serve as a reminder that The
            Word is true and applicable. The easy to understand manner that each
            thought is presented helps the reader to get a grasp of Biblical
            principles regarding how we should live our lives based on the Word
            of God. There have been so many that have been blessed by these
            messages that it was only befitting to finally publish some of the
            work. God desires for us to share the Good News with others, so this
            collection of AMTs should inspire you but also those around you.
            These writings are not only easy to read and understand, but they
            should also give you hope and guidance about how you should live out
            your life full of purpose. People often wonder how she comes up with
            so many different topics, but it is through a willingness to follow
            Christ by upholding His holy standards. Mind to Heart is a
            compilation of some of Andrea's latest work, and it is sure to bless
            you.
