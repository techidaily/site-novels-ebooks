          • Explores esoteric practices for individual development, handed down
          from a primordial tradition and discernable in alchemy, Hermetism,
          religious doctrines, Tantra, Taoism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and the pagan
          mysteries of the West <br /><br />• Reveals the ultimate magical goal
          of the “Absolute Individual,” the immortal and divine potential that
          requires rare gifts and extraordinary efforts for its realization
          <br /><br />This volume, the third in the series, complements the
          first two, yet they are not strictly sequential, and their contents
          can be read in any order. Volume III, more than the others, bears the
          personal stamp of Julius Evola. In its pages you’ll discover that the
          “magic” of the UR Group has nothing to do with sorcery or
          superstition. It was their term for an active and affirmative attitude
          toward individual development handed down from a “primordial
          tradition” and discernible in alchemy, Hermetism, esoteric religious
          doctrines, indigenous practices, Tantra, Taoism, Buddhism, Vedanta,
          and the pagan mysteries of the West. Its goal was the “Absolute
          Individual,” the immortal and divine potential that requires rare
          gifts and extraordinary efforts for its realization.
          <br /><br />However, there is incalculable value in this volume even
          for the less heroic. By studying the practices and realizations
          within, the reader will be liberated from conventional
          dogmas--religious, political, scientific, and psychological--and see
          with the clearer eye of realization.

          “Those who look to Julius Evola’s work for guidance have often
          wondered what practices Evola himself used to get in contact with
          Tradition. The answer lies in <i>Introduction to Magic</i>, which
          represents the records left behind by the UR Group, the mysterious
          occult order that was the medium through which Evola first experienced
          the reality of Tradition and grasped its essence. Many of the themes
          and concepts which were to recur in Evola’s later work are already
          present in these documents. The great importance Evola attached to
          these volumes is attested by the belief of Evola’s biographer that the
          original manuscripts were the only belongings he took with him when he
          was forced to flee Rome in 1944. The fact that this work is finally
          available in its entirety to Anglophone readers, masterfully
          translated by Joscelyn Godwin, is therefore a great service to genuine
          spiritual seekers everywhere.”
