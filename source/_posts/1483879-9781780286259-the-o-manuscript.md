          &nbsp;<br />
          In the opening scene of <i>The O Manuscript</i>, Lars Muhl is an
          aging, washed-up rock star who has been lying in bed for three years.
          Abandoned by doctors and living alone on an island, a friend gives
          Muhl the phone number of a “seer” in Andalusia. After a single phone
          call, Muhl is back on his feet and a three-year apprenticeship to the
          Seer ensues—an adventure that is part history lesson, part Jedi-style
          initiation.<br /><br />
          During their time together, the Seer challenges Muhl to abandon his
          old life, testing both his physical and emotional endurance, so that
          he may leave the burdens of his past behind. He also initiates Muhl to
          the mysteries of the Montségur and the Cathars—the medieval religious
          sect once persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church—in southern France.
          After years of searching for Montségur’s secret cave, Muhl finds
          himself in possession of the secret history of Mariam Magdalene,
          Yeshua, and the Holy Grail.<br /><br />
          <i>The O Manuscript</i> is not just another book about positive
          thinking. Throughout his initiation, Muhl was forced to confront his
          dark side, the shadows that kept him from true health and wellness.
          “This is my journey,” says Muhl. “Every word of it is true and really
          happened to me, but it is also meant to be a kind of allegory. The
          lessons I learned are universal.”<br /><br />
          Part memoir, part novel, and part spiritual treatise,
          <i>The O Manuscript</i> will forever change the way you think about
          life.

          <b>Lars Muhl</b>&nbsp;was for many years a successful
          singer/songwriter who, concurrently with his music, studied the
          world's religions and esoteric knowledge. Then, in 1996, he was struck
          down by an unexplained illness, which neither doctors nor alternative
          therapists could diagnose. For three years he was confined to his bed,
          unable to move. Through a friend, Lars was put in touch with a seer
          who, via the telephone, brought him "back to life." This experience,
          and the revelations that followed from it, are described in&nbsp;<i
            >The O Manuscript</i
