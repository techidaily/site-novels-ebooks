            >Within the concentric circles of Trump's regime lies an unseen
            culture of occultists, power-seekers, and mind-magicians whose
            influence is on the rise. In this unparalleled account, historian
            Gary Lachman examines the influence of occult and esoteric
            philosophy on the unexpected rise of the alt-right.</b
          ><br /><br />Did positive thinking and mental science help put Donald
          Trump in the White House? And are there any other hidden powers of the
          mind and thought at work in today's world politics? In Dark Star
          Rising: Magick and Power in the Age of Trump, historian and cultural
          critic Gary Lachman takes a close look at the various magical and
          esoteric ideas that are impacting political events across the globe.
          From New Thought and Chaos Magick to the far-right esotericism of
          Julius Evola and the Traditionalists, Lachman follows a trail of
          mystic clues that involve, among others, Norman Vincent Peale,
          domineering gurus and demagogues, Ayn Rand, Pepe the Frog, Rene
          Schwaller de Lubicz, synarchy, the Alt-Right, meme magic, and Vladimir
          Putin and his postmodern Rasputin. Come take a drop down the rabbit
          hole of occult politics in the twenty-first century and find out the
          post-truths and alternative facts surrounding the 45th President of
          the United States with one of the leading writers on esotericism and
          its influence on modern culture.

          <b>PRAISE FOR <i>BEYOND THE ROBOT</i>:</b><br /><br />"An enthralling
          account of the life and work of Colin Wilson, the often controversial
          writer who explored the nature of human consciousness in dozens of
          books ... Lachman writes about philosophical and mystical ideas with
          exceptional grace, forcefulness and clarity."<br /><b

            ><b>Michael Dirda</b><i><b>,&nbsp;</b>The Washington Post</i></b
          ><br /><br />"Colin Wilson came to a sudden and unparalleled celebrity
          with his first book,&nbsp;<i>The Outsider,</i>&nbsp;in 1956, and after
          that was strenuously ignored by every respectable critic. So much for
          respectability. Gary&nbsp;Lachman has written an intellectual
          biography of a writer who might be called the only optimistic
          existentialist, and done him justice. Wilson was always far better and
          more interesting than fashionable&nbsp;opinion claimed, and in Lachman
          he has found a biographer who can respond to the whole range of his
          work with sympathy and understanding, in a style which, like Wilson’s
          own, is always immensely&nbsp;readable. I enjoyed&nbsp;<i
            >Beyond the Robot</i
          >very much."&nbsp;<br /><b>—Philip Pullman<br /></b><br />“Without
          question, the definitive guide to the life and ideas of one of the
          most stimulating writers of our time. Highly recommended.” <br />—<b

            >—Ptolemy Tompkins, author of&nbsp;<i>Paradise Fever</i
            ><br /><br /></b
          >"In&nbsp;<i>Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of Colin Wilson</i>,
          author Gary Lachman has done us a great service in illumining what an
          original and inspired thinker Wilson was. In the process of doing so,
          the question arose in my mind as reader: Is Lachman himself stepping
          into becoming the modern-day Colin Wilson? This is one of those rare
          books that I read cover to cover, not wanting to miss a word. I simply
          loved it!"<br /><b

          >“Clocking in at 394 pages jam-packed with in-depth information,
          factoids, anecdotes and insights from the first sentence to the last.
          A historical biography through and through, Lachman’s book is
          meticulously researched and it is quite easy to believe that the
          author, like a professor well-versed in their subject, could analyze
          and extrapolate at much greater lengths. The oft touted declaration of
          Crowley as the Wickedest Man in the World, may well have been
          overblown in it’s own time, but he’s certainly not an individual with
          whom it is easy to empathize. As detestable as he is, there is an
          undeniable fascination in his exploits, and Lachman seems the perfect
          man to deliver them.”<b><br /><b>—The Examiner</b><br /><br /></b
          >“Gary Lachman has become an increasingly prolific engine of literate,
          well-written, and clear-headed books about esoteric history and
          ‘occulture.’ ”<b
            ><br /><b>—Erik Davis, author of&nbsp;<i>TechGnosis</i></b
            ><br /><br /></b
          >“Thinking outside the box, Lachman challenges many contemporary
          theories by reinserting a sense of the spiritual back into the
          discussion.”&nbsp;<b
