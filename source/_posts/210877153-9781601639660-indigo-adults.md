            >A New Age guide for to help individuals determine if they or their
            family members are part of a collective called to a higher purpose

          ><br /><br />Are you an Indigo Adult Soul and don’t know it?<br /><br />A
          new type of person is coming into incarnation right now, almost a
          “next step” in human evolution. These people hold great hope for the
          future—the promise of a new humanity and civilization. They are
          visionary and creative, progressive and independent. They carry new
          energies and manifest different ways of thinking and feeling.<br /><br />These
          people are called “Indigo,” because the color indigo (the color seen
          in the “third eye”) is unusually prominent in their aura. You may be
          familiar with the concept of “Indigo Children” and never realized that
          there are also Indigo adults&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or that you might be
          one of them!<br /><br />Do you feel different? Do you
          experience:Unusual sensitivities?Feelings of being separate or
          misunderstood?Frustrations and dissatisfactions with the “normal”
          world?A deep feeling, thinking, and introspective nature?A driving
          need to contribute to creating a better world?A powerful longing for
          something more?<br /><br /><i>Indigo Adults</i> is rooted in the
          authors’ personal experiences of the subtle dimension of life and
          reflects their explorations into the esoteric and mystic teachings of
          many traditions. This subtle dimension is not tangible to our “normal”
          analytical mind, and it is only beginning to be scientifically
          documented. Take what the authors are presenting as a hypothesis.
          Experiment with it, and come to your own conclusions.<br /><br /><i
            >Indigo Adults</i
          >
          will help you identity if you (or your children) are Indigos and
          understand yourself, and especially your purpose on Earth more
          clearly.
