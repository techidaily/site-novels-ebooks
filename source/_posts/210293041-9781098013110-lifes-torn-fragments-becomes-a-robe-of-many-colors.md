            Kathleen is desperate to find peace after years of mental and
            emotional torment which lead to drug addiction, suicide attempts and
            several psychiatric hospitalizations.She decides to set out on a
            spiritual journey of transforming prayer; in the hope of discovering
            what has been hidden in the caverns of her mind and heart. She is
            always asking the questions, "What is wrong with me?" and "How can I
            continue to live in this state of turmoil?"Unbelievable memories of
            childhood trauma were exposed. Revealing child parts of her heart at
            different ages, that were imprisoned within the pain and anguish of
            her past. Now, this pain, that had been locked away, could be safely
            processed and healed by the power of Jesus' love. Through a loving,
            healing relationship encounter with Jesus, she would be set free
            from the lies that had invaded her heart, which in turn kept God's
            Truth from taking up residence in her soul.Her quest for healing
            leads her into a spiritual battle for God's Truth to not only be
            discovered, but most importantly to be believed and received as the
            only Truth. She must choose to resist, by God's grace, the
            confusion, bewilderment and perplexity, that arise from the haunting
            falsehoods that have captivated her soul, from a lifetime of
            emotional damage.This book is her pilgrimage with Jesus toward
            wholeness, truth and freedom. The author's hope and prayer would be,
            that the reader would come to an understanding, that regardless of
            the pain which has taken place in an individual's life, that the
            lies which cripple a person are held within their emotional wounds.
            It is only by the power and love of the cross of Jesus Christ, that
            one can be brought into the Truth of who they truly are and how much
            they are loved.
