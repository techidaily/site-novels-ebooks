            Available as a four fortnightly mini-programs or a full length
            e-book, this revolutionary 8-week Mindfulness program gives you the
            mental flexibility to manage your emotions, implementing cognitive
            therapy strategies to lower stress levels, anxiety and mental
            pressures, and achieve perfect balance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weeks 5-6 look at letting things be. Unpleasant and unwanted
            experiences are an inevitable part of life. It is important to treat
            yourself with kindness and learn how to cope with the difficulties,
            irritations and obstructions that occur daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognising thoughts and emotions as mental events to make sense of
            is an important step forward. Our moods and feelings colour our
            thoughts, and in weeks 5-6 you will learn 3 key strategies for
            dealing with distress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Made up of a hybrid of the two most popular approaches to
            Mindfulness currently sweeping the world, Mindfulness: Weeks 1-2
            helps establish crucial life skills, such as learning to control
            behavior and regulate the body’s natural processes with meditation,
            while also enhancing emotional intelligence, proven to be associated
            with efficiency, good social skills and an increase in self
            awareness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start the journey today. Strengthen relationships with friends and
