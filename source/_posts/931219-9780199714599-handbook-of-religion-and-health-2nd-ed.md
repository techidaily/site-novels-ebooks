          The Handbook of Religion and Health has become the seminal research
          text on religion, spirituality, and health, outlining a rational
          argument for the connection between religion and health. The Second
          Edition completely revises and updates the first edition. Its authors
          are physicians: a psychiatrist and geriatrician, a primary care
          physician, and a professor of nursing and specialist in mental health
          nursing.The Second Edition surveys the historical connections between
          religion and health and grapples with the distinction between the
          terms ''religion'' and ''spirituality'' in research and clinical
          practice. It reviews research on religion and mental health, as well
          as extensive research literature on the mind-body relationship, and
          develops a model to explain how religious involvement may impact
          physical health through the mind-body mechanisms. It also explores the
          direct relationships between religion and physical health, covering
          such topics as immune and endocrine function, heart disease,
          hypertension and stroke, neurological disorders, cancer, and
          infectious diseases; and examines the consequences of illness
          including chronic pain, disability, and quality of life. Finally, the
          Handbook reviews research methods and addresses applications to
          clinical practice. Theological perspectives are interwoven throughout
          the chapters. The Handbook is the most insightful and authoritative
          resource available to anyone who wants to understand the relationship
          between religion and health.

          "A classic in the 'Handbook' genre...The authoritative resource for
          scholars working in the field of religion, spirituality, and
          health."--Journal for the Scientific Study of ReligionPraise for the
          First Edition "This book provides a fascinating look at the role of
          religion and the use of health services against the background of the
          current availability of and access to health care across all segments
          of society... This is an unparalleled resource not only for physicians
          with an interest in the relationship between religion and health but
          perhaps even more for those who doubt its significance. All physicians
          should consider the possibility that something so meaningful to a
          large number of patients might also be good for their health."
          -Journal of the American Medical Association "In addition to
          presenting a synopsis of the overwhelming amount of research in this
          area, the authors provide a thoughtful reflection and commentary that
          is based on their collective understanding of this research and its
          application. Does the book deliver on its promise? Absolutely. This is
          a must read for anyone interested in this field. It is well written,
          comprehensive, scholarly, and engaging... The authors should be
          commended for an extraordinary job on this soon to be classic
          text."--Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion "This would be an
          excellent addition to the library of congregations and their clergy,
          health educators, youth workers, and professional
          chaplains."--Anglican Theological Review "I encourage anyone concerned
          with faith and health, to get this book."--Journal of Epidemiology and
          Community Health "Not only researchers, but all concerned about
          health, should be grateful for the wealth of information this volume
          provides to support better research in the future."--Second Opinion
