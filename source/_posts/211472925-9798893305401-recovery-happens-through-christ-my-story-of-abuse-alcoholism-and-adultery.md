            <strong>Recovery Happens through Christ</strong> is taken from the
            journals of Marilynne Harrison, an otherwise regular person who
            found herself sexually abused as a child and exposed to a world of
            sin in such a way as to bring tears to one's eyes. By the time she
            was eleven, Marilynne was exposed to drugs, alcohol, and sex; and
            worst of all, was told to keep her situation to herself. The results
            of being robbed of her childhood led Marilynne to continue to live
            her life in the only way she knew, by continuing in the same sins.

          <p class="ql-align-justify">
            <strong>Finally, many years later,</strong> Marilynne makes a
            dramatic turn to God. He lifts her out of her pit in a truly
            impossible way. This book covers seventeen painful and then
            triumphant years in Marilynne' s life. She shares her tremendous
            struggles with sin, painful choices leading to more wrongdoing, and
            finally, a real call from our ultimate Savior, Jesus Christ.
            Celebrate her recovery and find hope for your own recovery, or that
            of your loved ones.

            <strong>Are you struggling</strong> with drugs, alcohol, and wrong
            sexual relationships? Are you trapped in a sex addiction and can't
            find your way out? Do you long to understand the relationship
            between the Christian and homosexuality? Is there real hope for gay
            and lesbian recovery? Do you feel as if there is no possibility for
            addiction recovery or abuse recovery? Before you lose all hope, find
            some quiet reading time and read the story of a lady with all the
            same reoccurring temptations and failures. With all her miserable
            existence, she provides hope to those who know exactly what she is
            talking about when she discusses her deplorable and self-destructive
            lifestyle. Do not give another moment of your life to yourself and
            Satan. Instead, allow yourself to be guided by the Holy Spirit to
            the One who also understands your temptations and is able to finally
            give you relief. Jesus Christ died for you, just as much as He did
            for Marilynne and the whole world. Just as He rescued Marilynne and
            gave her new life, He can surely do the same for you too.

            We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And
            this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are. For
            everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard
            ... People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus
            sacrificed his life, shedding his blood (Romans 3:22-25)
