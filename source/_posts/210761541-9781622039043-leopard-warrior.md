            <b>A Teaching Memoir That Crosses the Barriers Between Worlds</b
            ><br />&nbsp;<br />A shaman is one who has learned to move between
            two worlds: our physical reality and the realm of spirits. For John
            Lockley, shamanic training also meant learning to cross the immense
            divide of race and culture in South Africa.<br />&nbsp;<br />As a
            medic drafted into the South African military in 1990, John Lockley
            had a powerful dream. “Even though I am a white man of Irish and
            English descent, I knew in my bones that I had received my calling
            to become a sangoma, a traditional South African shaman,” John
            writes. “I felt blessed by the ancient spirit of Africa, and I knew
            that I had started on a journey filled with magic and danger.” His
            path took him from the hills of South Korea, where he trained as a
            student under Zen Master Su Bong, to the rural African landscape of
            the Eastern Cape and the world of the sangoma mystic healers, where
            he found his teacher in the medicine woman called MaMngwevu.<br />&nbsp;<br />In
            <i>Leopard Warrior, </i>John shares a gripping account of his
            experiences and the wisdom he learned over years of training. Here
            he invites you to discover:<br />&nbsp;<br />• Powerful insights
            into the spiritual tradition of the Xhosa lineage of South
            Africa—the tribe of Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu<br />• Ubuntu—a
            core concept for recognizing and embracing our deep interconnection
            with all living things<br />• Ancestor medicine—how we can learn to
            honor the blood in our veins, the heritage of our soul, and our
            shared humanity<br />• Recovering our forgotten knowledge about the
            wisdom of our dreams, the spirits of plants and animals, and the
            power of the unseen world<br />&nbsp;<br />In traditional African
            healing circles, the leopard represents intuition, instinct, and
            harmony with nature and the spirit world. As John Lockley writes, “A
            leopard warrior is a spiritual soldier who mirrors the natural world
            and directs their gaze inward to answer the call of their spirit.”
            With <i>Leopard Warrior, </i>he brings us an inspiring call to
            action—showing how we can bridge the barriers that divide us,
            embrace the gifts of our ancestors, and reclaim our rightful place
            as compassionate caretakers of our world.

          <b>John Lockley</b><br />JOHN LOCKLEY began his journey as a young
          medic drafted into the South African military. He then trained under
          Zen master Su Bong from South Korea, and returned to post-Apartheid
          South Africa to spend 10 years in apprenticeship with MaMngwevu, a
