          <p>
            In <i>Discovering Your Spirit Animal,</i> shamanic healer Lucy
            Harmer presents a practical approach to understanding spirit animals
            and applying their power to specific situations in daily life.
            Written in clear, simple language and featuring compelling stories
            and anecdotes, the book explains what a spirit animal is, describes
            its purpose, and shows that understanding the “medicine” of one’s
            spirit animal—assimilating its qualities and characteristics—allows
            one to apply the lessons and messages they convey and use them for
            personal transformation. Lucy Harmer notes that particular animals
            that cross one’s path or appear repeatedly nearby probably want us
            to share in their medicine, their teaching, their energy, and their
            spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Discovering Your Spirit Animal</i> provides guidance for meeting
            and getting to know one’s spirit animal through easy exercises and
            shamanic techniques. Lucy Harmer explains how to discover the
            strengths, qualities, and skills one shares with one’s personal
            spirit animal, enabling one to learn how to reinforce this
            connection and access innate wisdom and inner power, overcome fears,
            increase natural healing capacity, and improve relationships.

          “This book is a way for the ‘person on the street’ to dip their toes
          into a bigger way of seeing the unseen worlds around them.”—Nicholas
          Breeze Wood, editor of <i>Sacred Hoop</i> magazine “A delightful read
          for all animal lovers wanting to connect with their inner selves and
          apply ancient teachings.”—Randall N. Hyer, MD, DPhil, MPH“<i
            >Discovering your Spirit Animal</i
          >
          is a beautifully crafted book. Lucy Harmer, a truly gifted healer and
          seer, writes on this important subject with humor and compassion,
          creating a simple and easy-to-use guide for anyone who wants to
          connect with the power of their spirit animal.”—Pip Waller of the
          Dreaming Butterfly Centre and author of
          <i>Holistic Anatomy for Healers, Heretics and Alternative Folk</i>“I
          am very lucky to have met Lucy Harmer and to have had the chance to
          take part in her engaging, dynamic workshops. She has opened my eyes
          to see and experience the wisdom and riches of the many worlds we live
          in. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is seeking insights
          and guidance on their life paths. Lucy openly shares her vast
          knowledge and experience of spirit animal work along with clear,
          precise instructions for how to undertake shamanic journeying to
          discover your own spirit animal.” —Dorna Wilson Revie, founder and
          director of the International Sophrology Training Centre in Geneva,
          Switzerland“A beautifully written book on animal spirit guides full of
          practical exercises for how to develop a personal relationship with
          your own animal guides. Lucy Harmer shows the interconnectedness of
          the animal kingdom with human beings and gives hope to people looking
          for more meaning to their lives. I would recommend this book to anyone
          on the Shamanic path, and to those people looking for a more
          nature-based spirituality.”—John Lockley, African shaman, Xhosa
          Sangoma, South Africa“In these profound times of natural changes, Lucy
          Harmer shares her humble and rewarding journey into the worlds of
          Nawal, the elder spirit family who teaches and helps the younger
          animal family called humans.”—Chief Sonne Reyna, Yaqui-Carrizo Nations
          of North America and Sun Dance Peace Chief
