          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          So many people resign themselves to walking around every day
          miserable, settled into a career they hate with no clue how to get off
          the dead-end road on which they’ve found themselves.&nbsp;<i
            >Unstick Your Stuck</i
          >&nbsp;provides navigation for readers who need the motivation and
          game plan to create a fulfilled life beyond anything they ever dreamed
          possible. Life coach Melissa Morrison worked at a job she hated for
          over a decade. It took four softballs to the head and one major
          concussion for her to finally decide to change her career—and her
          life. Melissa teaches readers why they’ve stayed in their current
          state of unfulfillment, what they will need to take their exit, how to
          gain clarity on their dream, and how to take steps towards finding
          fulfillment. No one has to wait to get their bell rung—join Melissa in
          finding your fulfilled life today!
