          There’s much more to astrology than weekly horoscopes, personality
          types, and predictions for the future. For astrologer and
          transformational coach Jennifer Racioppi and her clients, it is a
          guide to living in sync with the natural rhythms of the universe to
          achieve optimal health and astonishing success.
          <i>Cosmic Health </i>provides a groundbreaking cross-disciplinary
          approach to cultivating physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual
          well-being. By honoring your individuality, your role in the universe,
          nature, and the seasonality of life, you will be armed with the
          knowledge—and magic—you need to cultivate uncompromising health.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Inside this beautifully illustrated book, you’ll learn to: Open
          yourself up to the big-picture patterns that influence you—the daily,
          seasonal, and monthly cycles that govern your biology—and leverage
          those patterns for conscious action, growth, success, and a thriving
          life. Decode the planets and their cycles to get a precise blueprint
          of your evolving emotional, physical, and spiritual health needs—like
          how to exercise for vitality, cultivate your purpose, tackle
          obstacles, and skillfully care for your emotional needs. Support your
          specific astrological makeup and goals with healing rituals that serve
          as sacred medicine, enriching your spiritual connections. Develop a
          rock-solid understanding of the connection between astrology, health,
          and evidence-based personal-development practices so you can nurture
          your resilience, elevate your well-being, and realize your heart’s
          desires. Learn to view health and life challenges as a threshold to
          self-actualization. Put your intuition and self-knowledge at the heart
          of your quest for health. Join the thousands of others who have used
          this body of work to transform their lives into fulfilling and
          multidimensional reflections of their <i>Cosmic Health</i>.
