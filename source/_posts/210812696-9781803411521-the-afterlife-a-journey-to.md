            “My name is Athar. At least it is now that I am here, in heaven. I
            can tell you the story only now. I couldn’t back then, when it was
            too painful, when it hurt too much. But now I know what happens.
            More than that, I now know why. I am not here to tell you what to
            believe. I am here to tell you what is true.”&nbsp;The Afterlife: A
            Journey To&nbsp;is an inspirational voyage of discovery through
            heaven's many portals - you will experience heaven’s many levels
            BEFORE you get there.

          This book enthralled me: in it I travelled with characters who found
          themselves experiencing the agony caused to others by their actions
          during their lifetime, and with those who had created and were locked
          into their own pain. While reading I had to discipline myself not to
          have a quick look at the end of the book to find out if there would be
          happy endings, until I recognised the theme of love that was guiding
          and supporting every character in a pathway leading to their respite
          or healing. A truly beautiful book.
