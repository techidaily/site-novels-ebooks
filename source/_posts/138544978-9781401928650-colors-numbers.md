          ><br />"Colors and numbers have a lot of significance for us. We each
          have our own personal number vibrations and personal color vibrations.
          Some of these numbers, such as our date of birth, are permanent. We
          also have temporary personal colors that change with the calendar.
          <br /><br />"By consciously surrounding ourselves with our personal
          colors, we become more in tune with the cosmic forces. Colors and
          numbers are useful to our lives and attitudes. They may form a basis
          for our affirmations and declarations about ourselves, which is
          exactly the purpose of this book. <br /><br />May every
          <i>Colors &amp; Numbers</i> day be a joyous one for you!" — Louise Hay

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Louise Hay </b>was an inspirational teacher, incredible visionary,
          and self-help pioneer who educated millions since the 1984 publication
          of her bestseller, <b><i>You Can Heal Your Life</i></b
          >, which has more than 50 million copies in print worldwide and spent
          16 weeks on the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers list. She appeared
          on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> and many other TV and radio programs
          both in the U.S. and abroad. Renowned for demonstrating the power of
          affirmations to bring about self-healing and positive change, Louise
          was the author of more than 30 books, including the bestsellers
          <b><i>The Power Is Within You </i></b>and<b><i> Heal Your Body</i></b
          >. In addition to her books, Louise produced numerous audio and video
          programs, card decks, online courses, and other resources for leading
          a healthy, joyous, and fulfilling life. Louise was dubbed “the closest
          thing to a living saint” by the Australian media and in 1985, Louise
          began her famous support group, “<b>The Hayride</b>,” with six men
          diagnosed with AIDS. By 1988, the group had grown to a weekly
          gathering of 800 people and had moved to an auditorium in West
          Hollywood. In 1987, what began as a small venture in the living room
          of her home turned into <b>Hay House, Inc.</b>: the largest publisher
          of self-help books, events, and courses. Hay House has sold millions
          of books and products worldwide and now has offices in California, New
          York, London, Sydney, Johannesburg, and New Delhi.<b>
            The non-profit Hay Foundation</b
          >, established by Louise in 1986, continues to support organizations
          that enhance the quality of life for people, animals, and our
          environment. Websites: www.louisehay.com, www.hayhouse.com, and
