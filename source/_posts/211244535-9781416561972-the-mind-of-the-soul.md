          "This book can dramatically change your life by showing you how to
          take responsibility for the choices you make and break free from the
          illusion that you are a victim of your circumstances." So begins one
          of the most significant works you will ever encounter. <br />
          People make hundreds of choices every day -- both large and small --
          yet most individuals feel they have little control over their own
          lives. Now Gary Zukav, author of the monumental bestseller
          <i>The Seat of the Soul,</i> joins his spiritual partner, Linda
          Francis, in a revolutionary look at the power of choice and how to use
          it wisely. They explain how changing our decision-making can help us
          avoid self-defeating patterns of thought and action -- and help us
          take control of our lives by creating authentic, positive power.
          <br /><i>The Mind of the Soul</i> describes how each moment in life is
          a moment of decision: wheth- er to persist in the old, limited
          patterns of life or to choose instead to experiment with the
          unbounded, liberating potential ahead of us. Using the same pragmatic
          terms that made <i>The Heart of the Soul</i> so meaningful, Zukav and
          Francis allow readers to develop, step by step, the ability to break
          free of unconscious choices that hold them back and limit their
          fulfillment in life. <br />
          Whether your choices are large ones -- concerning work, marriage,
          parenting, or divorce -- or smaller day-to-day choices, such as
          shouting or showing annoyance when you are angry, they carry
          consequences for which you must assume responsibility. You will
          discover that in any situation one choice among the many that present
          themselves to you is the optimal choice -- to create harmony,
          cooperation, sharing, or reverence for Life. When you make this
          choice, you gain the freedom to experiment with your life, see what
          does or does not work for you, learn to change yourself instead of
          blaming others, open your heart, and develop authentic power. <br /><i

          is a book to be used, not merely read. It is packed with specific,
          practical exercises, diagrams, and meaningful illustrations that make
          you a participant in the process of responsible choice. To accompany
          this book, the authors have created a special
          <i>Self-Empowerment Journal</i> with additional material to help you
          focus your thoughts and emotions as you read and to invite you to
          record your insights after each exercise. The discoveries you make in
          both the book and the Journal will become a permanent part of your
          life long after you have turned the last page.
