            >Drawing on indigenous wisdom traditions, a shamanic healer offers a
            body-based approach to working through the fears and trauma that
            inhibit transformation and growth</b
          ><br /><br />To create a world free from oppression, we each have to
          face the ways that we maintain toxic social systems within ourselves.
          In indigenous cultures throughout the world, it’s understood that true
          transformation starts in the body with a change of heart.<br /><br />Shamanic
          healer Langston Kahn offers the Deep Liberation Process, a body-based
          approach that allows us to radically transform the range of fear-based
          stories we each hold in ourselves: from traumatic experiences,
          internalized oppression, and habitual emotional patterns to the
          outmoded beliefs that hold us back from healing, transforming, and
          freeing our authenticity and unique genius. Bridging the shamanic
          wisdom of ancient spirituality with the needs and demands of
          modern-day life, Kahn offers concrete skills to cultivate deep
          grounding, skillful boundaries, and a healthy energy body; methods for
          authentic shadow work and healing our triggers; and tools for
          effectively tending personal and collective well-being in
          community.<br />&nbsp;<br />“With <i>Deep Liberation</i>, our sacred
          calling is made accessible to all who are willing to listen for it
          within themselves.”

          "With <i>Deep Liberation</i>, our sacred calling is made accessible to
          all who are willing to listen for it within themselves."<br />—ADRIENNE
          MAREE BROWN, author of <i>Pleasure Activism<br /></i><br />&nbsp;"Kahn
          offers powerful practices to tend to our deepest hurts as we attempt
          to be human in a world that so often wants us to be other than human.
          [This is] . . . an invitation for us to reconnect to our own hearts as
          well as to our souls, passions, and our communities."&nbsp;<br />—LAMA
          ROD OWENS, author of <i>Love and Rage<br /></i><br />"Kahn helps not
          only to liberate our own individual souls from the traumas that hold
          us hostage, but also to mend the balance with our communities and
          spirits."<br />—DAVID SHI, author of&nbsp;<i>North Asian Magic</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />"A breath of fresh air in a society constricted by
          the Western mainstream&nbsp;medical model. I recommend this book for
          psychologists, scholars, and activists&nbsp;who wish to engage with a
          worldview that is at once deeply resonant,&nbsp;ancient, progressive,
          and wise."&nbsp;<br />—VANESSA SINCLAIR, PSYD, psychoanalyst and
          author of&nbsp;<i>Scansion in Psychoanalysis and Art</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />"Langston deftly hoists a calabash of Indigenous
          healing wisdoms&nbsp;and spiritualities and alchemizes a recipe of
          exercises, practices, and rituals to address trauma and to equip those
          who linger in the wake of world-endings for the work we must do in the
          world yawning to wake."<br />—BAYO AKOMOLAFE, PHD, author of&nbsp;<i
            >These Wilds Beyond Our Fences<br /></i
          >&nbsp;<br />"This is an accessible toolkit for undoing the psychic
          and emotional damage that limits our possibilities for experiencing
          true wellness and can shape how and to what degree we can express our
          soul’s purpose."&nbsp;<br />—AIDAN WACHTER, author of<i>
            Six Ways:&nbsp;Approaches &amp; Entries for Practical Magic<br /></i
          ><br />"Gently presented and thoroughly developed, the soul education
          in this book is not just the one all soul tenders should have access
          to; it’s taught with the compassionate authority we all crave."<br />—S.
          KELLY HARRELL, author of <i>Gift of the Dreamtime</i><br /><br />"I
          have never read a book dealing with anything shamanistic that
          approaches the depth here. This is an important text for seekers who
          want to develop their innate shamanic abilities to free their past,
          present, and future lives."<br />—GRANDFATHER DUNCAN SINGS-ALONE,
          author of <i>Sprinting Backwards to God<br /><br /></i>"Under the
          crush of a global sociopolitical reckoning . . . Kahn locates the
          importance of psychic and material ancestrality in the service of
          collective healing and, ultimately, communal liberation. This book is
          a must-read. . . ."&nbsp;<br />—LARA SHEEHI, PSYD, faculty at the
          George Washington University Professional Psychology Program<br /><br />"A

        </h4>
        <p>
          LANGSTON KAHN is a Black, Queer, New York City-based shamanic
          practitioner who specializes in radical human transformation,
          ancestral healing, and restoring an authentic relationship with our
          emotions. He stands firmly at the crossroads; his practice is informed
          by somatic modalities, contemporary shamanic traditions, and
          initiations into traditions of the African diaspora, and his helping
          spirits and ancestors weave it all together. Langston gives workshops
          and lectures internationally, in person and online. He has completed
          nine years of training with Christina Pratt in the Cycle of
          Transformation and was one of the first people in thirty years to be
          selected to be a senior teacher and carry forth the lineage. He has
          served for five years on the leadership council of the Last Mask
          Community, a collective&nbsp;of people who are striving to live in
          alignment with ancient shamanic principles and who are applying these
          principles in service of personal and collective liberation. You can
          find out more about his work at his website: LangstonKahn.com.
