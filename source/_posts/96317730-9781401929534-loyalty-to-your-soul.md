            ><i>Loyalty to Your Soul</i> establishes Spiritual Psychology as a
            paradigm-altering frontier. It initiates a radical shift at the core
            of contemporary psychological thought by unveiling a technology for
            using everyday life experiences as rungs on the ladder of spiritual
            evolution. <br /></b
          ><br />This book is uniquely suited for anyone seeking to discover and
          cross the bridge that spans the waters between life referenced in
          material reality and life lived within the context of spiritual
          reality. <i>Loyalty to Your Soul</i> shows you how to first gain
          access to, and then gradually learn to live from, that sacred place
          inherent within everyone referred to by the authors as the Authentic
          Self—a place where emotional suffering ceases and profound peace and
          love are present. <br /><br />While many people have written about
          such an inner state, Ron and Mary Hulnick show you how to travel there
          . . .and what to anticipate once you arrive. The radical technology
          they introduce empowers readers to transform challenging or negative
          human experiences into direct experiences of the Soul.

          “Drs. Ron and Mary Hulnick are assisting the birth of something vastly
          important—an answer to the spiritual hunger that millions of
          individuals now feel. If you want to replace that gnawing emptiness in
          your life with a sense of meaning and fulfillment,&nbsp;<i
            >Loyalty to Your Soul</i
          >&nbsp;is the guide you’ve been looking for. Written in crystal clear
          lan-guage, this book is a gem, and could only have been written by two
          people whose lives overflow with experience and wisdom.”<br /><b
            >— Larry Dossey, M.D.</b
          >, the author of&nbsp;<i>The Power of Premonitions</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Healing Words</i><br /><br />“Ron and Mary Hulnick
          are the premier teachers and practitioners of Spiritual Psychology in
          the world today.&nbsp;The transformational Master’s degree Program
          that they offer through the University of Santa Monica has changed
          thousands of lives. This book, so eagerly awaited, makes their work
          available to us all. It is truly a Rosetta stone for the Soul.”<br /><b
            >— Joan Borysenko, Ph.D.</b
          >, the author of&nbsp;<i>It’s Not the End of the World</i>&nbsp;and
          co-author of&nbsp;<i>Your Soul’s Compass<br /></i><br />“With&nbsp;<i
            >Loyalty to Your Soul</i
          >, Ron and Mary Hulnick give us a wonderful guide to what it really
          means to live a spiritual life, as well as a great thought system in
          Spiritual Psychology, which I believe will be the wave of the future
          and which they have been developing for the past 30 years. Having
          heard them speak at their home site, the University of Santa Monica—as
          well as having a partner who is a graduate of USM—I must say that Ron
          and Mary don’t just teach these principles, they live them every
          day.”<br /><b>— Gary R. Renard</b>, the author of&nbsp;<i
            >The Disappearance of the Universe</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Your Immortal Reality</i><br />&nbsp;<br />“<i
            >Loyalty to Your Soul</i
          >&nbsp;is the work of master teachers, two of the very best in our
          world. Ron and Mary Hulnick give us a step-by-step method and set of
          principles not only to overcome our egoic reactions, our upsets and
          fears, but to use as signals from our Souls as to what and how we can
          learn. Each problem serves as an awakener. We become Soul con-scious
          as we apply the wisdom of the Soul to the problems of the ego. This is
          conscious self-evolution at its very best. A vital work for us
          all.”<br /><b>— Barbara Marx Hubbard</b>, author, evolutionary
          educator, and founder of the Foundation for Conscious Evolution<br /><br />“Bookstore
          shelves are filled with guides telling us how to get our bod-ies in
          shape, but there is very little practical advice about exercising our
          souls. Yet throughout America, millions seek to make their lives about
          something more than their own comforts and successes.&nbsp;<i
            >Loyalty to Your Soul</i
          >&nbsp;can be the handbook for that exploration. It tears down the
          false wall we’ve put up between our minds and our spirits, and shows
          the way toward a more fulfilling life.”<br /><b
            >— Arianna Huffington</b
          >, the cofounder and editor-in-chief of&nbsp;<i>The Huffington Post</i
          ><br /><br />“I am grateful to Ron and Mary Hulnick for having written
          this book. They manage to make lofty spiritual principles clear and
          easy to understand, and they show you how you can apply them to your
          life. What more can you expect?”<br /><b>— Piero Ferrucci,</b
          >&nbsp;the author of&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Soul</i
          ><br /><br />“Reading Ron and Mary Hulnick’s wonderful book of
          practical wis-dom reminds the Soul of its inherent unity while
          lovingly guiding you, its manifestation in form, in discovering and
          fully living the call to Wholeness through your Soul’s unique
          qualities.”&nbsp;<br /><b>— Leonard Laskow, M.D.</b>, the author
          of&nbsp;<i>Healing with Love</i><br />&nbsp;<br />“Ron and Mary
          Hulnick are living treasures in the field of transfor-mational
          learning. Now, with this remarkable new book, they give us a handbook
          for how to live based in Spirit. Their love and dedication to
          liberating our highest potential comes through on every page.
          Read&nbsp;<i>Loyalty to Your Soul</i>&nbsp;and feel the magic of their
          work.”<br /><b>— Kathlyn and Gay Hendricks</b>, the&nbsp;authors
          of&nbsp;<i>Conscious Loving</i><br /><br />“As a USM [University of
          Santa Monica] graduate, I know firsthand the value I received from
          participating with Ron and Mary in the Mas-ter’s degree Program in
          Spiritual Psychology. I am so grateful to have&nbsp;<i
            >Loyalty to Your Soul</i
          >&nbsp;to sweetly remind me of all I have learned. Let’s just say that
          I went from playing an angel on TV to living more of an angelic life
          every day. The teachings in this beautiful book have sent me on a
          journey to the very center of my own being where, wrapped in the safe
          wings of Love, I feel as though I have come home.”<br /><b

          are my teachers. They taught me to recognize and embrace the power,
          beauty, and maj-esty of my soul. I am excited that they are now
          sharing their wisdom with the world. I invite you to feast on this
          wisdom as you would a good home-cooked meal. I have no doubts that
