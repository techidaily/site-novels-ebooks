              >Are you caught in a slump, not sure where your life is headed? Or

          <p>
            Life is noisy. It's all too easy to go on autopilot, getting done
            what we think we have to get done, day after day. Then, one day, we
            wake up and realize that we've been doing that month after month,
            even year after year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nowadays, life is so demanding. There's so much busywork in the
            daily grind that we don't have the time to ask ourselves the
            important questions. Maybe you no longer know what your priorities
            are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Are you happy? What do you want out of life? How are you going to
            get there? If you don't know the answers to these questions, you're
            not alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our brains are no longer trained to ask tough questions. All too
            often, they're happy to go with the flow-until they're not. But you
            don't have to let life just happen to you. You do have the power to
            make changes. You're the one in charge of your life. You make things
            happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>It's time to ask yourself: Why do I do what I do?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Habits of the Mentally Tough details six stages to taking back
            control of your life. You'll learn strategies to increase your
            energy level and motivation so that you can tackle anything that
            comes your way. Most importantly, you'll learn what you're truly
            capable of and concrete ways to live your best life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside Habits of the Mentally Tough, you'll train your brain to:
          </p>
          <p><strong>increase your mental strength and resiliency.</strong></p>
          <p>tap into true motivation.</p>
          <p>eliminate bad habits.</p>
          <p>silence self-doubt.</p>
          <p><strong>achieve your full potential.</strong></p>
          <p>And much, much more!</p>
          <p>
            This book will teach you how to use your mind to take care of your
            body and direct your life in the direction you want it to go. It
            will show you how to set yourself up for success by defining your
            goals-and sticking to them. It's time to stop reacting and start
            acting. You're in the driver's seat, and you can get started on your
            journey right away with Cornish's 66-day challenge.
