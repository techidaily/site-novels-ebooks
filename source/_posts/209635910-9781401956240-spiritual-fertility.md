            being cannot be reduced to a mass of cells and biochemical

          ><br />This book explains how to use the tools of spirituality and
          psychology to relax the endocrine system, change your perspective, and
          get pregnant.<br /><br /><i>Everyone</i>&nbsp;is fertile; however, our
          common standards for measuring fertility are faulty. Today, our
          currently accepted narratives around fertility offer much in the way
          of diagnosis, but little in the way of customized care and
          consideration of a woman's entire mind, body, and spirit.&nbsp;<br /><br />The
          dynamic spark responsible for creating each new human being cannot be
          reduced to a mass of cells and biochemical processes. There is a
          deeper mystery at play, one that women struggling with fertility can
          tap into.<br /><br />In this ground-breaking book, holistic fertility
          doctor Dr. Julie Von shows women a new way to approach fertility so
          that the entire experience of becoming pregnant is energetically
          uplifting. She shares tools and techniques that help nourish and build
          women's receptive energy to connect to the spiritual and unseen
          aspects of creating life. Dr. Von helps readers understand that
          principles of cosmic timing can be applied to all processes having to
          do with fertility and child-rearing, from freezing eggs, to
          conceiving, to choosing to adopt. With close to 20 years of clinical
          experience, Dr. Von has witnessed firsthand the power of the spiritual
          within fertility to balance the hormonal system and promote a healthy
          pregnancy.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Dr. Julie Von </b>is a Manhattan-based holistic doctor specializing
          in fertility. She obtained a doctoral degree from Shanghai University
          of Traditional Chinese Medicine, a degree from the American College of
          Traditional Medicine in San Francisco, and has studied with healers,
          shamans, and doctors around the world. Dr. Von merges her medical
          education with her initiation into Earth-based intuitive practices.
          The energetic and intuitive work she shares is grounded in rigorous
          clinical and medical experience and expertise. Her clinical practice
          is guided by the sincere desire to help individuals connect to the
          spirits of their children, while guiding them to Earth in the gentlest
          and most loving way.<br />Dr. Von's clinical work in New York City has
          spanned over a decade and has connected her with some of the most
          advanced and well-known names in the field of fertility medicine. She
          lives with her husband and daughter in both New York City and the
          Hudson River Valley.
