            <strong>WHAT ON EARTH IS HAPPENING? AND <u>WHY</u>?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Record-breaking weather. Soaring debt. A pandemic. Social unrest and
            economic chaos. Many changes are taking place, all over the world.
            They are all connected and there is a reason why they are happening
            at this time.
          </p>
          <p>What lies ahead? How do we cope with it? Where will it end?</p>
          <p>
            This book provides the "big picture" answer. The present Creation is
            about to end and be replaced by a new one. Twelve different
            "futures" will emerge across 12 different timelines, and Terra is
            one of those futures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our guides for this journey are the Hosts of Heaven, a group of
            fifth-density beings who can "see" back to when Operation Terra
            began 4.5 billion years ago, and forward to 200 years from now, when
            it will end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 51 Messages contained in this book are true holographic
            transmissions. They carry light codes. If you carry the matching
            codes in your DNA, the Messages will be the sound of "home." They
            also tell us what we can expect as the planet ascends, both in terms
            of our own transformation and how to find peace in the midst of the
            coming storms.
          </p>
          <p>If you are going to Terra, then this book is for you!</p>

            deep stress in which the structures underpinning our societies have
            crumbled, we need the wisdom of a higher perspective more than ever.
            ... For those precious few still seeking a safe path through the
            minefield of irrelevance, Operation Terra provides invaluable
            assistance."</strong

            questions and delivers great relief to those who have been searching
            for the clarity of their path. Finally, you can begin to understand
            what is going on in the world today and what it will mean for

            words, deep ideas, and an unusually broad view of human soul growth
            and the Earth's own path. Whether you are new to the field, or you
            have already read dozens of New Age books, I think you'll be
            impressed with this book. I strongly recommend it, and I know you'll

            promise to be fulfilled. It is written in a way that is real,
            understandable, and helpful to reconnect to the Source. The words,
            "Let go-let God," have a particular alignment to this truthful gift
            of TERRA and redirect one's priorities to what is really
            important."</strong

            afresh by their elevating profundity. [Sara] is definitely tuned in
            to a high, clear frequency of loving, cosmic inspiration, and her
            painstaking presentation of the Messages she receives reflects her
            reverence for them, and for all who are attracted to them. I
            recommend them without hesitation to any who quest for a vision of
            Higher Love and Higher Wisdom. The Messages improve with repeated
            reading."</strong
