          • Reveals Crowley’s sex magick relations in London and his contacts
          with important figures, including Dion Fortune, Gerald Gardner, Jack
          Parsons, Dylan Thomas, and black equality activist Nancy Cunard
          <br /><br />• Explores Crowley’s nick-of-time escape from the Nazi
          takeover in Germany and offers extensive confirmation of Crowley’s
          work for British intelligence <br /><br />• Examines the development
          of Crowley’s later publications and his articles in reaction to the
          Nazi Gestapo actively persecuting his followers in Germany
          <br /><br />After an extraordinary life of magical workings, occult
          fame, and artistic pursuits around the globe, Aleister Crowley was
          forced to spend the last fifteen years of his life in his native
          England, nearly penniless. Much less examined than his early years,
          this final period of the Beast’s life was just as filled with sex
          magick, espionage, romance, transatlantic conflict, and extreme
          behavior. <br /><br />Drawing on previously unpublished diaries and
          letters, Tobias Churton provides the first detailed treatment of the
          final years of Crowley’s life, from 1932 to 1947. He opens with
          Crowley’s nick-of-time escape from the Nazi takeover in Germany and
          his return home to England, flat broke. Churton offers extensive
          confirmation of Crowley’s work as a secret operative for MI5 and
          explores how Crowley saw World War II as the turning point for the
          “New Aeon.” He examines Crowley’s notorious 1934 London trial, which
          resulted in his bankruptcy, and shares inside stories of Crowley’s
          relations with Californian O.T.O. followers, including rocket-fuel
          specialist Jack Parsons, and his attempt to take over H. Spencer
          Lewis’s Rosicrucian Order. The author reveals Crowley’s sex magick
          relations in London and his contacts with spiritual leaders of the
          time, including Dion Fortune and Wicca founder Gerald Gardner. He
          examines Crowley’s dealings with artists such as Dylan Thomas, Alfred
          Hitchcock, Augustus John, Peter Warlock, and Peter Brooks and dispels
          the accusations that Crowley was racist, exploring his work with
          lifelong friend, black equality activist Nancy Cunard.
          <br /><br />Churton also examines the development of Crowley’s later
          publications such as <i>Magick without Tears</i> as well as his
          articles in reaction to the Nazi Gestapo who was actively persecuting
          his remaining followers in Germany. Presenting an intimate and
          compelling study of Crowley in middle and old age, Churton shows how
          the Beast still wields a wand-like power to delight and astonish.

          “Aleister Crowley has found the biographer he could have wished for.
          By staying close to the original sources, Tobias Churton has managed
          to dive deeply into the emotional life of an unparalleled religious
          thinker who celebrated life. <i>Aleister Crowley in England</i> is
          like the man himself--profound, witty, imaginative, and joyous.”
