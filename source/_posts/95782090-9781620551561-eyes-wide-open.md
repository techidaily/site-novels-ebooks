          Meditation practices to awaken the body and create a mind like a
          mirror, to literally see things as they are <br />
          <br />• Draws on the story of the monk Shenxiu to create a meditation
          practice for profound relaxation, inclusion and connection to the
          world around us, and realization of our essential nature <br />
          <br />• Explains how our attitudes, beliefs, and bodily tensions
          distort our perceptions and lead to our sense of separation from the
          world outside our bodies <br />
          <br />• Details techniques of vision, such as sky gazing, eye gazing,
          and mirror gazing, that lead to an ecstatic mindfulness <br />
          <br />Right behind your eyes, you are there. You can feel yourself
          there, looking. So intimate is your connection with your looking that
          when you say, “I’m looking,” you’re implying that how you look and
          what you see are a direct reflection of who you are in this moment.
          Your attitudes and beliefs reflect what you see, and the way you live
          in your body can color your perceptions as well. <br />
          <br />This splitting in two of experience--an inside-the-body world
          and an outside-the-body world--creates in many of us a sense of
          isolation and loneliness, a feeling of disconnection from the larger
          world at which we look. But the visual field is equally capable of
          reflecting a sense of connection and inclusion, an invitation to merge
          with the larger universe rather than confirming how irrevocably
          separated we are. <br />
          <br />Drawing on the story of the seventh-century Chinese monk
          Shenxiu, Will Johnson offers meditation exercises to create a mind
          like a mirror, cleansing it of obscuring layers of worry and emotion
          to literally see things as they are, not just how we perceive them to
          be. He explains how to awaken your body to the sensations we learn to
          ignore when we lose ourselves in thought and tense ourselves in ways
          that stifle the body’s vibrancy. He offers meditative techniques to
          silence the projections of the mind and enter into a condition of
          ecstatic mindfulness. He details gazing practices, such as sky gazing,
          eye gazing, and mirror gazing, to cleanse our vision and remove
          whatever is distorting our perceptions. <br />
          <br />Through this new kind of seeing, divisions between your inner
          and outer world start to drop away. You begin to experience an
          intimate connectivity to the world you look out onto. By cleansing the
          mirror of the mind, we can come out of the dreams of who we think we
          are and awaken into our true, essential nature.
