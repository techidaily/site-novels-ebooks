          <b>Priase for Seka Nikolic<br /></b><br />"Whenever I’m feeling run
          down or my battery is low, I go to Seka for a boost in energy. I’ve
          been seeing her for years and I always feel invigorated after a
          treatment. I recommend her to all my friends, for ailments both large
          or small. She’s a very cool lady."&nbsp;- <b>Joely Richardson</b>,
          actress<br /><br />"Immediately after the first session I could feel a
          difference. It’s funny for me to hear myself say that after being so
          cynical but I really could feel the change in my energy. I continued
          to see Seka for the whole week and each day I got more of a buzz. By
          the end of the sessions I had so much more energy than when I’d
          started out – and not just physically. I was mentally more alert and
          found it easier to focus on my game. I was generally feeling healthier
          and it was as if life had come back to me." -
          <b>Ronnie O'Sullivan</b>, seven-time&nbsp;World Snooker Champion<br /><br />"Although
          I’ve met many healers over the years, Seka is truly exceptional. She
          has helped many people all over the world with her amazing ability.
          She’s a remarkable person with a very special gift." -
          <b>Paul McKenna</b><br /><br />"Seka has an incredible ability to help
          the body recover from injury – something I have experienced on several
          occasions. She also helps me boost my energy levels during periods of
          intense performance, making her a key member of my support team." -
