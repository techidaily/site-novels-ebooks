            Happiness<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >, Dr. Bacchus presents a synthesis of positive psychology,
              wellness practices, and the practical applications of love.
              Starting with a foundation of understanding four Greek words for
              love (eros-love, storge-love, philia-love, and agape-love), this
              book leads the reader into a process of self-exploration.
              Self-examination leads to self-understanding, greater
              self-acceptance and self-management, with an outcome of higher
              self-actualization. This process is a life-long cycle for personal
              growth.</span

            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >Personal growth is applicable to all humans regardless of the
              belief system. All humans (with few exceptions) naturally seek to
              love and be loved, to enjoy optimum health, and to feel happy and
              fulfilled in life. Love, Wellness and Happiness leads its readers
              through a review of constructs that explain how a person is a
              functional whole; how love on the physical, mental, psychosocial
              and spiritual levels leads to happiness; and how to use ten
              practices to promote high level wellness. Each of the wellness
              principles is associated, by analogy, with a principle for
              spiritual growth.

            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >The Jungian concept of archetypes (symbols that embody a specific
              set of qualities) is used to challenge readers for personal growth
              in positive qualities. The archetypes used are the Warrior,
              Miracle-worker, Lover and Ruler. For believers in Christianity,
              and for authenticity with the author's beliefs and experiences,
              the archetypes are used to point to Christ. Love, wellness and
              happiness are focused towards life-long growth to "maturity in
              Christ" as the ultimate goal of wellness, the best way to love,
              and the greatest happiness for this life and beyond. The book
              emphasizes that for all humans, the science, psychology and
              spirituality are the same. Believers in different religions can
              adapt common principles to serve their growth needs.</span

            Love, Wellness and Happiness
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >is packed with practical "Tips and Strategies (T&amp;S)" for
              promoting personal growth as a whole person. T&amp;S in the
              physiologic dimension include a test for proper hydration, eating
              like the longest-living humans on earth, optimizing sexuality, and
              preventing major chronic diseases. T&amp;S in the mental dimension
              include stimulating creativity, use of mental imagery for stress
              management, and practicing mindfulness. T&amp;S in the
              psychosocial dimension include building habits in savoring life,
              forgiving self and others, intentional kindness, and gratitude.
              T&amp;S in the spiritual dimension include understanding and
              protecting the spiritual DNA, spiritual reproduction, and
              spiritual nutrition. Together, these T&amp;S lead to effective
              stress management, regular self-examination, increased emotional
              health and wellness, overall personal growth, and, for Christians,
              growth to maturity in Christ. Agape love is held as the ideal to
              strive for.

              >is also packed with stories from the author's life experiences
              that illustrate the use of specific T&amp;S, or give background to
              the birth of the ideas and concepts unique to this book. For
              example, after dealing with a stress-induced spastic colon
              syndrome for several years, he learned "The Relaxation Response,"
              and was able to quit using prescribed medications. Also, he was
              able to overcome extreme hot-tempered impulsiveness that could
              have ruined his life-he came close to killing one brother.
              Overcoming negative traits and destructive tendencies is one major
              outcome of love in action.</span
