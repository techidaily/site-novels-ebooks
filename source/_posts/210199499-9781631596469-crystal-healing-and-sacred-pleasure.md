            ><br /><br />
            Whether you’re new to crystals or experienced with crystal healing,
            <i>Crystal Healing and Sacred Pleasure</i>&nbsp;offers the essential
            information and techniques you need to
            <b>get your energy flowing freely again</b>.<br /><br />
            The flow of energy through our chakras (the energy centers of our
            bodies) is essential to our fundamental well-being and our ability
            to experience our lives fully. When chakras get blocked, the natural
            flow of energy is hindered, and we experience disconnection from our
            physical bodies.&nbsp;Crystal healing can
            <b>release blockages</b> and bring necessary attention to our whole
            being, while helping to
            <b>heal physical or emotional trauma</b>.<br /><br />
            Crystals have been used for centuries as a way to
            <b>release and harmonize energy</b>. Each crystal has its own unique
            qualities that are suited to specific kinds of blockages. When used
            properly, crystals can have a powerful and positive effect on our
            lives.&nbsp;<br /><br />

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Vanessa Cuccia</b> is regarded as a pioneer in the sex toy industry
          for introducing her methods of using crystals for sexual healing and
          empowerment on a global scale. She is the founder and creator of
          Chakrubs, The Original Crystal Sex Toy Company, and she continues to
          receive testimonials from people around the world who use her Chakrub
          products and methods. These overwhelmingly positive testimonials have
          inspired her to write
          <i>Crystal Healing and Sacred Pleasure</i>.<br /><br />
          Since conceptualizing her initial designs for crystal pleasure tools
          in 2011, and establishing her brand in 2012, Cuccia has been an
          influencer in the social movement of sex positivity, self-love, and
          personal awareness by bridging the gap between sensuality and
          spirituality. As creator of products that symbolize the essence of
          these movements, she spearheaded the ethos of the brand which is
          inspiring many to nurture their own emotional intelligence,
          self-awareness, and spiritual connection.<br /><br />
          Cuccia cultivated her knowledge of crystals and energy work while she
          was living in LA to pursue a career in music. During this time she
          worked a part-time job at an adult store where she fostered her
          education on sex positivity. Cuccia merged both principals, which
          sparked the idea of sexual exploration with the use of crystals. The
          recognition for the potential crystals have to facilitate energy
          movement inspired Cuccia to utilize crystals to enhance sexual
          pleasure. Cuccia’s work has been a fixture in the Hammer Museum and
          Museum of Sex, featured in magazines such as New York Magazine,
          Cosmopolitan, Elle and Allure, appeared on notable digital platforms
          such as Buzzfeed and VICE, and has been featured on shows such as The
          Doctors and Conan. Cuccia has also received the attention of many
          notable artists who have collaborated with their own sensibility,
          bringing to light different aspects of the profound messages Chakrubs
          inspires.&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          As a certified crystal healer and reiki practitioner, Cuccia continues
          to pursue knowledge of crystals and metaphysical modes of healing to
          help those who have experienced sexual trauma or simply wish to deepen
          pleasure and connection to self, spirit, and others. Cuccia is a
          musician whose knowledge of energy extends through her performances.
          She currently resides in New York.<br />
