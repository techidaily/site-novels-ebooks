          Furthers the revelations of <i>The Urantia Book</i>, providing a
          beautiful vision of our coming return to the Multiverse <br />
          <br />• Offers angelic reassurance that “Armageddon has been canceled”
          and that the coming transition will be gentle and the future positive
          <br />
          <br />• Explains Lucifer’s angelic rebellion, its impact on the past
          200,000 years, and the transformation of consciousness on the horizon
          as the fallen angels return <br />
          <br />• Shares the author’s spiritual wisdom gained through extensive
          travels and encounters with angels, ETs, and other enlightened beings
          <br />
          <br />As recorded in <i>The Urantia Book</i>, two hundred millennia
          ago 37 planets, including our own, were quarantined from the rest of
          the Multiverse to quell the spread of the Lucifer rebellion within the
          angelic hierarchy. Now, after eons of isolation, the fallen angels
          have been forgiven and Earth’s connection with the Multiverse is being
          restored, initiating a massive transformation of consciousness as we
          reconnect with angelic guides, extraterrestrial beings, and our
          spiritual heritage as sacred vessels for God’s presence. <br />
          <br />Providing an update to <i>The Urantia Book</i> through angelic
          transmissions he has received and remarkable spirits he has met,
          Timothy Wyllie investigates the underlying motives of the angelic
          rebellion and the impact it has had on our planet for the past 200,000
          years. Offering a profoundly optimistic vision of the future and
          reassurance that the coming spiritual transition will be gentle,
          Timothy Wyllie describes his encounters with angels, ETs, and other
          enlightened beings around the world, including how he made contact
          with his own guardian angels, met the man who may have been Grand
          Master of the Prieure de Zion, fell in love with a beautiful Cathar
          reincarnate in Provence, and officiated at the 1981 Conference in
          Spirit inside the Great Pyramid of Giza. He explores different
          planetary cosmologies, authentic extraterrestrial intelligence,
          entheogenic revelations, and the spiritual implications of the
          Holographic Paradigm, weaving together a coherent and provocative
          understanding of the current state of our planet within the larger
          context of a benevolent and caring Multiverse.

          intelligences greater than ours; and who are eager to participate

          Trained as an architect, Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was a graphic
          artist and writer who, after a near-death experience in 1973,
          specialized in the study of non-human intelligences, such as angels,
          ETs, and dolphins. He was the author of several books, including
          <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels</i> and
          <i>Confessions of a Rebel Angel</i>.
