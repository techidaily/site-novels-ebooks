              continue to be heightened because the destiny of the human race
              hangs in the balance. Our ministry of reconciliation cannot be
              done on human wisdom, intellect, tactics or strategy devoid of the
              power and the working of the Holy Spirit.</strong

              >As Christians, we should realize that we are spirit with a mind
              using our bodies as containers to execute. As Christians, our
              spirit has joined with the Spirit of God at conversion. To be
              motivated in body, we have to first be motivated in our spirit.
              The Spirit then communicates to our spirit and this to our minds
              and our minds instructs our body to take action based on the
              instruction sent to us by God's Spirit in us.</strong

              ways of the Holy Spirit, some of us have either ignored or grieved
              the Holy Spirit. As a result, our sensitivity to Him has died or
              He has chosen not to lead us any longer.</strong

              our sensitivity and working with our best friend who is ready and
              willing to help us be all that God has called us to be and to do.
              At the end of this series, some of us will begin to dream dreams
              with more clarity and poise, we will be activated in the realm of
              visions again, we will begin to pick up promptings, voices, flows
              from the Holy Spirit and interpret them accurately what the Holy
              Spirit is saying to us the churches so that we can be effective in
              the mission field of life.</strong
