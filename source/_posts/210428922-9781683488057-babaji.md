            "What if you could know a Being who is not born of a woman and who
            could dematerialize and rematerialize his body?
          </p>
          <p></p>

            What if you could know a Being who is a major teacher of Jesus and
            who prepared him for his mission?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            What if you could know a Being who knows everything about your past,
            present and future?

            Along with Steve Jobs, spiritual seekers worldwide have most likely
            read the famous "Autobiography of a Yogi" by Yogananda. BABAJI, the
            immortal "Yogi-Christ" of India, is mentioned in Chapters 33 &amp;
            34. Author SONDRA RAY brings flesh and blood to His legend in this
            account of her real-life meetings with BABAJI in the 1970's and
            1980's, at the beginning of her mission of world service as the
            "Mother of Rebirthing." More than just an autobiographical sketch,
            SONDRA's miraculous meetings with this real Maha Avatar will help
            anyone who is on a spiritual journey of Self-awakening to move
            faster in their joyous ascension to enlightenment.

            SONDRA RAY is joined my her twin flame, MARKUS RAY, who contributes
            his insightful poetry to BABAJI as He manifests in the everyday
            encounters with His presence in such places as Starbuck's and
            Nordstrom's, Catalina Island, and in HIs sublime mountain ashram of
            Haidakhan in the foothills of the Himalayas of Northern India.
