            >A simple antidote to our nature-starved lives,
            <i>The Joy of Forest Bathing</i> is an enticing and comprehensive
            introduction to forest bathing—or Shinrin-yoku, in Japan—the
            meditative practice of connecting with nature and disconnecting from
            the distractions of daily life.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Full sensory immersion in the beauty and
          <b>wonder of nature and trees</b> can produce
          <b>mental, emotional, and physical health benefits</b>. Research has
          shown that forest bathing lowers blood pressure, pulse rate, and
          cortisol levels; improves mood; and may even boost our immunity to
          cancer and other diseases.<br /><br /><i>The Joy of Forest Bathing</i>
          invites you to experience the benefits of this healing practice for
          yourself. Learn the<b> history and background </b>of forest bathing,
          followed by
          <b
            >detailed instructions for establishing a forest bathing practice </b
          >in your own adopted “wild home,” encompassed in three steps:<br />
          &nbsp; 1. Disengagement from your daily routine 2. Deep breathing and
          nature connection through a series of quiet activities or
          “invitations” 3. Transitioning back to your daily life &nbsp; This
          restorative activity
          <b>can be enjoyed by people of all ages and abilities</b>: children,
          teenagers, and even senior citizens with limited mobility and people
          recovering from illness and surgery. And you don’t need to travel to
          the Japanese alps to experience the benefits of forest bathing.
          <b
            >All you need is a small patch of untouched (or lightly touched)
            nature</b
          >
          to adopt as your “wild home.”<br /><br />
          Within, find
          <b
            >practical tips and inspiration for forest bathing through the
            seasons</b
          >: in the winter, when the leafless trees open up new vistas; in the
          spring, when you can hear the melodious serenade of song birds as they
          nest in the newly formed green canopy; in the summer, watching the
          butterflies nectaring on wildflowers; and in the autumn, when you can
          catch glimpses of hurried squirrels storing food for the winter.<br /><br /><i
            >The Joy of Forest Bathing</i
          >
          introduces a variety of
          <b>activities that can be enhanced with forest bathing elements</b>,
          such as mindfulness practices, exercise, art and writing, and outdoor
          celebrations. Learn, too, how surrendering to the mysteries of nature
          can <b>provide guidance through difficult times</b>.<br /><br />
          As you find nourishment in nature, you will instinctively begin to
          wonder<b> how you can preserve and protect this healing resource</b>.
          This guide includes suggestions for tending to your “wild home.”<br /><br />
          Illustrated throughout with <b>enchanting artwork</b> by Dutch
          illustrator Lieke van der Vorst and stunning
          <b>nature photography</b>, <i>The Joy of Forest Bathing </i>is the
          perfect guide to enhancing your life with the wondrous world of
          nature.<br /><br />

          life you love through multiple acts of self-discovery and reinvention.

          personal mantra. From learning how to obtain more restful sleep and
          creating a healthy work/life balance to developing personal style and
