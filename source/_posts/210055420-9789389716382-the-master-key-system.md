            <strong>The Master Key System</strong>&nbsp;teach you that
            everything around us was first developed as a thought. Thought,
            therefore, is the powerful catalyst towards making any idea a
            reality. What would be possible if you could unlock your entire
            mental potential? The Master Key System is one of the classic works
            in the Science of Thought tradition. This book will not only leave
            you feeling good, but also thinking good. Charles F. Haanel
            discusses everything from how to feel healthy to how to become
            wealthy. Using precise logic and a consistent, common-sense
            frame-work, he shows us how to achieve that what we most desire.

            <strong>About the Author:</strong><br /><strong
              >Charles Francis Haanel</strong
            >
            (May 22, 1866 – November 27, 1949) was a noted American New Thought
            author, philosopher and a businessman. He is best known for his
            contributions to the New Thought Movement through his book The
            Master Key System. The Haanel family was of Swedish extraction, but
            had lived in Silesia, Prussia, before emigrating to Canada and
            thence to the United States.&nbsp;<br />Haanel's book The Master Key
            System was published in 1912, when he was 46 years old. It is
            written in the form of a course in New Thought, mental development,
            financial success, and personal health. The book was heavily
            promoted in the pages of Elizabeth Towne's New Thought magazine The
            Nautilus. By 1933 it had allegedly sold over 200,000 copies
            worldwide. Haanel practiced the financial principles he preached,
            and was a self made success who owned several major companies.
            According to Stevens, writing in 1909 – he was president of the
            Continental Commercial Company, president of the Sacramento Valley
            Improvement Company, and president of the Mexico Gold &amp; Silver
            Mining Company.
