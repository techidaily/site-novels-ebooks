          or the problem to a new level of enjoying life.<br />&nbsp;I believe
          that the teachers known as Abraham are some of the best on the planet
          today.”<br />– Louise Hay<br /><br />“This book will reveal the
          dynamic processes for using more of your untapped potential—in this
          lifetime. Have you ever wondered how much potential for joy lies yet
          untapped within you?<br /><br />And when you relive those delicious
          relationship experiences that you’ve shared with those whose lives
          you’ve touched as you’ve grown into the Being that is now you—aren’t
          you aware that there must be many more delightful relationships with
          so many more inspiring persons who are out there waiting for you to
          attract them into your life experience?<br /><br />&nbsp;"I credit
          Abraham for the degree of joy that Esther and I experience as we’re
          blessed with this opportunity to create different means of projecting
          their joy-based philosophy of practical spirituality to you.”<br />—
          From my heart, Jerry Hicks<br /><br />“We want you to remember that
          you are an Eternal Creator who has come forth into this Leading Edge
          to experience the joyous expansion of your Universe. We want you to
          remember your value, to know your worthiness, and to love your
          life.<br /><br />The most important thing for you to remember is that
          the better you feel, in any moment in time, the more in alignment with
          your Source and your desires you are. And nothing is more important
          than that you feel good.<br /><i
            ><br />You are here on the Leading Edge of thought to experience the
            joy of riding the wave of expansion that is the promise of this
            everlasting life.” – </i

        </h4>
        <p>
          Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from
          the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began
          disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close
          business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being
          received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical
          questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations,
          Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of
          Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of
          how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference
          center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately
          50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction
          workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding
          stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has
          been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers
          and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of
          Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures,
          and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person
          to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of
          spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November
          2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther
          continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her
          physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical
          help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly
          by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online
          live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube
          library of Abraham videos. Abraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical
          teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And
          as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of
          loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in
          print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our
          loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total
          Self. Abraham-Hicks Publications may be contacted through the
