            This book examines in detail a short book, often referred to
            as&nbsp;The Five Tibetans&nbsp;that was published in 1939 teaching a
            simple yet effective set of five exercises for health and longevity,
            the Five Rites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Certain dietary rules and lifestyle principles accompanied the
            Rites, so did a Sixth Rite that worked the diaphragm muscles and
            redirected sexual energies, and also a set of teachings about seven
            energy centers or vortices in the body, though not the same as the
            well-known seven chakras along the spine.
          </p>
          <p>
            These vortices are among the most distinctive things about the
            system, and are found in only a scattered handful of sources
            elsewhere. It is by awakening the vortices to their normal rate of
            spin, the book claims, that the Rites achieve their effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Michael Greer follows each of these threads back as far as
            possible, to reveal something of the landscape of ideas and
            practices that gave rise to these remarkable exercises.
          </p>
          <p>
            He then spins the threads back together, putting the Five Rites in
            as much of their original context as he can, and describing in
            detail the practice of the broader system in which the Rites have
            their placeâ€”a system of inner alchemy meant to awaken certain subtle
            powers of the human body and mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book also includes the complete original text of The Eye of
            Revelation.
