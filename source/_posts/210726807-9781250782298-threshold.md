            Terminal lucidity is a relatively common but poorly understood
            phenomenon. Near the end of life, many people--including those who
            have suffered brain injuries or strokes, or have been silenced by
            mental illness or deep dementia--experience what seems a miraculous
            return. They regain their clarity and energy, are able to talk with
            families and caregivers, recall their lives and often appear to be
            aware of their nearing death.<br /><br />In this remarkable book,
            cognitive scientist and Director of the Viktor Frankl Institute Dr.
            Alexander Batthyány offers the first major account of terminal
            lucidity, utilizing hundreds of case studies and his research in the
            related field of near-death studies to explore the mind, the body,
            the nature of consciousness, and what the living can learn from
            those who are crossing the border from life to death.<br /><br />Astonishing,
            authoritative, and deeply moving, Threshold opens a doorway into one
            of life's--and death's--most provocative mysteries.

          “This is a terrific book. Dr. Batthyany has created an enlightening
          examination of the phenomenon that is very familiar to those who care
          for the terminally ill and their families. <i>Threshold</i> should
          have a positive effect on the care of the terminally ill.” <br />--Dr.
          Raymond Moody, author of <i>Life After Life<br /></i
          ><br />"Captivating... This engaging examination of consciousness in
          the borderland between life and death explores our sense of self, how
          our identities are tied to our bodies, and what happens when those
          links are severed. <i>Threshold </i>is guaranteed to challenge your
          concepts of who you are.” --Bruce Greyson, M.D., Professor Emeritus of
          Psychiatry &amp; Neurobehavioral Sciences, University of Virginia, and

          <i>Everything You Wanted to Know About Heaven<br /><br /></i>"In his
          groundbreaking book, <i>Threshold</i>, Alexander Batthyany skillfully
          and magically describes the mystery and miracle of terminal lucidity,
          raising the existential question about what exactly is “self” and what
          happens after one's journey of life reaches its completion."--Dr.
          Rudolph E. Tanzi, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>Super Brain</i> and <i>The Healing Self</i> <br /><br />"In a world
          where science has become reductionist in its scope,
          <i>Threshold</i> reminds us that our lives have deep meanings which
          defy quantification and which are essential to our physical and
          emotional well being."--Dr. Jay Lombard, author of
          <i>Mind of God</i> and
          <i>Neuroscience and the Search for the Soul <br /><br /></i> "<i
            >Threshold</i
          >
          weaves together the astonishing phenomenon of terminal lucidity and
          remarkable death-bed experiences, with keen reflections from the
          perspectives of the neurosciences and existential philosophy. In so
          doing, author Alexander Batthyany challenges our most basic
          understandings of life, death, and consciousness. This compelling
          journey through the mysteries of the mind transcends the boundaries of
          biological materialism, and it underscores the profound value of
          individuality and human dignity. Highly recommended." -- Dean Radin,
          PhD, Chief Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences, and author of
          <i>Real Magic<br /></i><br /><i>"Threshold</i> is a masterpiece! This
          book is a treasure trove of insights about terminal lucidit (TL) and
          its implications for understanding the bigger picture of
          consciousness. Dr. Batthyány delivers superb science along with
          fascinating examples of TL and related experiences. This book is a
          sentinel event establishing TL as a <i>real </i>and extremely
          important phenomenon. Each turn of the page contains convincing
          evidence that we are far more than simply the product of our physical
          brain. This book is scholarly yet remarkably easy to read. I
          enthusiastically recommend this exceptional book as essential to
          <i>everyone</i> interested in understanding the greater picture of
          consciousness and spiritual experiences."<br />--Jeffrey Long, M.D.,
