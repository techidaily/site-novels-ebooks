          Have you ever thought why every workout you have ever done stopped at
          the neck? Or wondered why traditional yoga calms the mind, tones the
          body but forgets the face? Are you looking for a natural way to look
          and feel younger and healthier?&nbsp;<br /><br />Danielle Collins,
          TV's Face Yoga Expert, believes we should all have the opportunity to
          look and feel the very best we can for our age and to care for our
          face, body and mind using natural and holistic techniques. Her method
          requires just 5 minutes a day and could not be easier to get
          started.&nbsp;<br /><br />Integrating practical facial exercises with
          inspirational lifestyle tips, including diet and skincare, Danielle
          Collins' Face Yoga is a revolutionary new programme to help you
          achieve healthier, firmer, glowing skin..
