            >Who would have thought that survivors of child abuse, domestic
            violence, overdose, illness, combat, and other trauma would follow
            the same path to healing... and that they would all develop
            spiritual gifts?</strong

          <p>
            Trauma-Inspired follows the trauma healing journey of one survivor -
            together with the compelling input of 50 others. This eye-opening
            account reveals and explores the raw emotions and lingering effects
            of trauma, while displaying the incredible resilience of the human
            spirit as it transforms tragedy into triumph.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trauma-Inspired blends a step-by-step path to healing, tips and
            tricks from survivors, and transformational exercises into its
            powerful narrative. The result is a trauma recovery toolkit for
            survivors - and those trying to help them heal. And the twist? All
            50 of these survivors were inspired by an unexpected gift...an
            extra-sensory connection.

          "Stop. No, really, stop. You need to read this book. This isn't just
          another trauma survival story. When we have a tragedy, we think that's
          where we have to stay, but this book shows you another path.
          Trauma-Inspired is eye-opening, thought-provoking, and
          enlightening."&nbsp;

          "Trauma-Inspired made me realize I was never alone in how I was
          feeling, and how I was struggling. It shows you how to heal from
          trauma and shares the positive things that can happen as a result. If
          you have experienced trauma or love someone who has, you should read
          this book."&nbsp;

          "In the new book Trauma-Inspired, Linda shares not just her own story
          of battling through trauma, but also the stories of many others. This
          book is real, relevant and raw. It's also beyond needed for countless
          people seeking to learn from the lessons of trauma and move beyond it
          to a better life."&nbsp;

          "As a journalist, I have covered mental health from many different
          perspectives. However, I rarely come across books that contain useful
          action items - for trauma survivors and their loved ones. And
          Spellman's 'twist' puts this particular book in a class by
          itself."&nbsp;
