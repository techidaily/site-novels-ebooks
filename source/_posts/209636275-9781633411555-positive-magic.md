        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Marion Weinstein</b> (1939-2009) was an author, teacher, media
          personality, and proud New York City witch. Known as the “Ethics
          Witch” she is one of the founders of the modern witchcraft movement.
          She was the first to coin the phrase and define “positive magic” and
          clearly delineated its use. Her radio show, <i>Marion’s Cauldron</i>,
          was the first regularly scheduled Wiccan and psychic programming on
          record and was a New York phenomenon for 14 years.
          <i>Positive Magic</i>, her first book, was published in 1978 and soon
          became a beloved classic. One student recalled Marion’s personal
          definition of magic as “transformational” and that her lifelong goal
          was to destigmatize witchcraft and show its positive influence on the
          world.
