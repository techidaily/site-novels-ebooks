            The more we strip ourselves down, the more potent life becomes.
            Having the courage to unearth our individual truths leads us to the
            sacred space of an open, peaceful and loving heart, even in the
            midst of controversy and challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            While navigating through unforeseen death, the loss of her baby boy,
            cancer, and a miraculous birth through surrogacy, Julianne Haycox
            found herself nudged closer and closer towards a spiritual
            connection to her heart and soul. As she turned inward and stepped
            back out into the natural world that she loved most, she discovered
            that within this sacred silence were the answers to what she needed
            to heal and unleash. In<strong></strong>Conversations with Grace,
            she shows that the most important aspect of our lives is how we show
            up each and every day, whether we are enveloped in divine miracles
            or entrenched in adversity.

          “One will call this a book, but in truth what Julianne has created
          here is an incredible collection of experiences accompanied by the
          very thing that matters most to us all, inspiration and the beautiful
          ability to see these experiences from a space of love. We felt her
          pain, we celebrated her joyous moments,&nbsp; and we were reminded
          that we are all one! Get your highlighter; many of Julianne’s quotes
          will make your heart sing and soul breathe easy!” &nbsp;<strong
