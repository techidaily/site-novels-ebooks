          <strong>RADICALLY REIMAGINE THE SECOND HALF OF LIFE</strong><br />
          <br />
          “There can be a certain perverse pleasure, as well as a sense of
          rightness and beauty, in insisting on flowering just when the world
          expects you to become quiet and diminish.”<br />
          — from the book<br />
          <br />
          For any woman over fifty who has ever asked “What now? Who do I want
          to be?” comes a life-changing book showing how your next phase of life
          may be your most dynamic yet. As mythologist and psychologist Sharon
          Blackie describes it, midlife is the threshold to decades of
          opportunity and profound transformation, a time to learn, flourish,
          and claim the desires and identities that are often limited during
          earlier life stages. This is a time for gaining new perspectives,
          challenging and evolving belief systems, exploring callings,
          uncovering meaning, and ultimately finding healing for accumulated
          wounds.<br />
          <br />
          Western folklore and mythology are rife with brilliantly creative,
          fulfilled, feisty, and furious role models for aging women, despite
          our culture’s focus on youthfulness. Blackie explores these archetypes
          in Hagitude, presenting them in a way sure to appeal to contemporary
          women. Drawing inspiration from these examples as well as modern
          mentors, you can reclaim midlife as a liberating, alchemical moment
          rich with possibility and your elder years as a path to feminine
          power.<br /><br />

          “Hagitude is a fascinating book. It’s well researched, packed with
          stories and bursting with lovely descriptions of the natural world.
          There’s plenty in it to inspire women of every age.”<br />
          <strong>— The Sunday Times<br /> </strong><br />
          “Hagitude has the power to change lives. By sharing her personal story
          alongside potent female figures from myth and history, Sharon Blackie
          offers us a rich and exciting vision of how we can grow into a more
          connected and creative second half of life. Full of fierce energy,
          this is a book that acts like a ration of courage, of purpose.”<br />
          <strong>— Tanya Shadrick, author of The Cure for Sleep<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “Like all Blackie’s works it is erudite, wise, passionate and
          empowering — a feast and a joy of a book.”<br />
          <strong
            >— Sophie Anderson, author of The House with Chicken Legs<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “Hagitude takes readers through the “house of elders” — an
          extraordinary cast of figures including fairy godmothers, wise women,
          tricksters and creators, offering bewitching role models for women in
          their later years.”<br />
