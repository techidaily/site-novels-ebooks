          A confidence-boosting program based on the spiritual insights of
          Sanskrit, the language of enlightenment <br /><br />• Draws on
          traditional stories from East and West and scholarly works to reveal
          the wisdom behind Sanskrit words and how to experience them to
          transform our lives and build confidence, certainty, clarity, and
          success <br /><br />• Explains the fourfold energy of the Conscious
          Confidence program: Focusing, Uniting, Simplifying, and Energizing
          <br /><br />• Offers practical exercises for discovering our inner
          certainty and overcoming fear, anxiety, and insecurity
          <br /><br />Called “the language of enlightenment,” Sanskrit is truly
          unique among all the languages of the world. This ancient language,
          upon which so many of our English words are based, gives us an entire
          system to show what to do in order to experience the full meaning of a
          word. In this profound way, Sanskrit offers a touchstone of timeless
          wisdom that each of us can access to transform our lives and build
          confidence, certainty, clarity, and success. <br /><br />In
          <i>Conscious Confidence</i>, Sanskrit scholar Sarah Mane offers a
          practical confidence-boosting program, derived from the deepest
          meanings of Sanskrit concepts, to help you establish a safe and secure
          reference point from which to see the world and make clear decisions
          on how to act, what to say, and how to feel. She explores the Sanskrit
          roots of English words related to confidence and success, unlocking
          rich, three-dimensional understandings of each word as well as
          guidance on how to obtain confidence and find your path in life. For
          example, the word <i>attitude</i>, based on its Sanskrit roots, means
          “<i>our point of view, our intent, and our conduct</i>.” A positive
          attitude means we have a self-aware point of view, have an intent for
          the good, and conduct ourselves in ways that reflect both. This true
          <i>attitude</i> gives us a positive and powerful place from which to
          view the world. The author also incorporates traditional stories from
          East and West, such as the <i>Mahabharata</i> and the works of Plato,
          scholarly references, and accounts of people discovering hidden depths
          in their own lives through the ancient truth of Sanskrit.
          <br /><br />Drawing upon the deeper meanings behind several Sanskrit
          words for confidence, Mane outlines principles for harnessing the
          fourfold energies of Conscious Confidence and offers practical
          exercises for discovering our inner certainty. She explains how the
          Conscious Confidence method allows us to tackle the growing anxiety
          and fear that hang like a shadow over many of us and look to the
          unchanging core of selfhood for certainty, rather than ever-changing
          externals. <br /><br />With the Conscious Confidence program and the
          wisdom of Sanskrit, you can discover a strong and steady inner source
          of compassion, self-direction, self-empowerment, and the life force of
          self-confidence.

          “This book is no quick snack. It's an epic feast for a hungry soul who
          wants access to some of the deepest wisdom that has come to us over
          thousands of years. Sarah Mane has been immersed in a journey of
          discovery through philosophy and the study of Sanskrit since she was
          just a pup. In what could be a formidable, dry, boring meal straight
          out of academia, she serves instead a rich, nourishing spread of
          knowledge and insights that satiates and satisfy mind, body and soul.
          I thoroughly admire her tremendous skills of communication, curiosity,
          and her deep comprehension of her materials. As a book designer, I
          quite literally read hundreds of books, so I am really pleased to
          celebrate one of the few books that has hooked my avid attention. I
          plan to have her book by my side forever, so I can linger with, dip
          into and savor each rich, surprising, succulent chapter.”
