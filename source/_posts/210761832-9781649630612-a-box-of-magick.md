              >Discover the Magick that lives within you.
              <i>A Box of Magick</i> will connect you with herbalism, rituals,
              and spells through the guidance of two priestesses, one from
              beyond the veil.</b
            ><br /><br /><i>A Box of Magick</i> is a call to adventure, an
            invitation to awaken and activate the deepest part of your most
            mystical, powerful self. Traditionally, Magick has been taught with
            close, one-on-one guidance that is rarely available to practitioners
            of all levels today. This book invites us to practice with two
            magickal guides, author Jamie Della and her Elder Wiccan High
            Priestess and mentor Connie DeMasters. Fifteen years after Connie’s
            passing, Jamie received a literal box of Magick on her doorstep, 23
            pounds of Connie’s rituals, hymns, spells, charts, astrology, and
            more. Through this unexpected gift, Connie is still teaching
            Jamie―and now they are both teaching us!<br /><br />With the warmth
            of female mentorship, <i>A Box of Magick</i> offers a path of
            personal growth and empowerment and shares:<br />• Inspiration to
            recognize the magickal lessons, universal messages, and helpful
            signs that exist all around us―from cycles of the sun, moon, and
            planets to herbs• Rituals that help us face and integrate the shadow
            self, develop abiding self-love, and stand with a sword of personal
            truth held ready• Lessons in how to foster a relationship with
            crystals, herbs, living creatures, and elemental spirits, as well as
            our own stories, and write your own spells• Storytelling and
            parables that teach discernment as we connect magickal insights with
            our own experiencesAs Jamie shares, this guide offers “a mentor to
            help you live the craft of the wise and deepen your ability to
            manifest, intuit, and connect with the language of our alive world
            and its limitless possibilities.” <i>A Box of Magick</i> shares
            seeds of magickal wisdom and shows us how to turn them into a
            blossoming, evolving magickal life, spiced with the essence of our
            own unique spirit.

          “<i>A Box of Magick</i> does beautifully what brings most into the

          from the beginning that is impossible to resist. A must for anyone who
          wants to light up their life and have a magickal adventure.” —<b

          >, author of<i> Green Witch Magick</i><br /><br />“Jamie Della’s
          latest book, <i>A Box of Magick</i>, is a delightful combination of
          memoir and grimoire that takes the reader on a journey of remembrance
          and discovery. Nestled in between recollections of honest,
          down-to-earth conversations with her now-departed mentor Connie
          DeMasters, Jamie artfully delivers the details of Connie’s wide
          variety of teachings for creating and growing a meaningful magical
          practice. Every person who’s meant to walk a witchy path will find
          something within these pages that resonates with their own magic.
          Wherever Connie is now, she’s beaming with pride, as her student has
          obviously become the teacher. Well done!” —<b>Cairelle Crow</b>,
