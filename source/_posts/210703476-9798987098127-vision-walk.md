              >Most of us have not found lasting happiness because we have been
              searching outside ourselves. Vision Walk teaches how to discover
              and explore the truth within-the source of lasting happiness, the
              authentic self.</span

              >When you look with your heart, you will always see the truth. And
              when you see the truth, you will naturally take the action that is
              aligned with your greatest happiness. It is just a matter of
              accessing and trusting your own inner wisdom-the part of you that
              knows the answer to any question you could ask.</span

              >&nbsp;If you have been seeking answers to these or other pressing
              life questions, a Vision Walk can guide you in minutes to finding
              the answers you need-often very profound and life-changing
              answers.</span

          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            On the surface, the Vision Walk is about asking questions and
            getting answers, but that is only the beginning. If you allow
            yourself to be pulled into deeper water, it can take you to places
            beyond questions, beyond problems, beyond your wildest imaginings.
            All you need is the curiosity to try something new, the willingness
            to leave old habits behind, and an eagerness to explore what lies
            beyond the known.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            While most of us live from socially conditioned beliefs and habits,
            the truth is that we are much more than we think we are. The Vision
            Walk is a doorway to that "much more," that deeper consciousness.
            Beneath the masks we wear and the roles we play, our true self is
            shining like a bright sun. It is always there; it never goes out. It
            is an endless source of joy and creativity. In fact, it is life
            itself, and all it needs is a chink in our armor to shine through in
            all its radiant splendor.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            During the Vision Walk, as you set aside your mind, you travel into
            your heart to ask a question of supreme importance. Minutes later,
            in the symbols of everyday things, you receive your answer, and in
            that moment everything changes. In that moment, you know your answer
            is true and that it came from the highest authority imaginable.
            Suddenly, you have embarked on a much larger and grander journey.
            For in that moment, you are in intimate touch with your very own
            self, the boundless, eternal ocean of consciousness that creates and
            sustains all life. In that moment, you have discovered the greatest
            treasure of all.

          <p>
            Rooted in both Native American and Toltec spiritual traditions,
            Brandt Morgan beautifully presents the book in phases, including
            important background information, how the Vision Walk process works,
            a meditation that will guide you through the process, and how to
            interpret your own journey. In later chapters, he offers wonderful
            stories and teachings that shed more light on how to find,
            experience, and live from your authentic self. In the book, he also
            includes Vision Walk questions you can ask, plus letters from Vision
            Walkers illustrating a wide range of personal experiences, as well
            as journal pages where you can record your own.

            Hopefully you will do a Vision Walk yourself. When you do, you may
            find that you have temporarily left the world behind and immersed
            yourself in an unusual state of love, peace, joy, and wisdom. After
            doing so, you may want to visit more often, or even live there more
            consistently. And so you can.
