          Reveals how the Rothschild Banking Dynasty fomented war and
          assassination attempts on 4 presidents in order to create the Federal
          Reserve Bank<br /><br />• Explains how the Rothschild family began the
          War of 1812 because Congress failed to renew a 20-year charter for
          their Central Bank as well as how the ensuing debt of the war forced
          Congress to renew the charter<br /><br />• Details Andrew Jackson’s
          anti-bank presidential campaigns, his war on Rothschild agents within
          the government, and his successful defeat of the Central Bank<br /><br />•
          Reveals how the Rothschilds spurred the Civil War and were behind the
          assassination of Lincoln<br /><br />In this startling investigation
          into the suppressed history of America in the 1800s, Xaviant Haze
          reveals how the powerful Rothschild banking family and the Central
          Banking System, now known as the Federal Reserve Bank, provide a
          continuous thread of connection between the War of 1812, the Civil
          War, the financial crises of the 1800s, and assassination attempts on
          Presidents Jackson and Lincoln.<br /><br />The author reveals how the
          War of 1812 began after Congress failed to renew a 20-year charter for
          the Central Bank. After the war, the ensuing debt forced Congress to
          grant the central banking scheme another 20-year charter. The author
          explains how this spurred General Andrew Jackson--fed up with the
          central bank system and Nathan Rothschild’s control of Congress--to
          enter politics and become president in 1828. Citing the financial
          crises engineered by the banks, Jackson spent his first term weeding
          out Rothschild agents from the government. After being re-elected to a
          2nd term with the slogan “Jackson and No Bank,” he became the only
          president to ever pay off the national debt. When the Central Bank’s
          charter came up for renewal in 1836, he successfully rallied Congress
          to vote against it.<br /><br />The author explains how, after failing
          to regain their power politically, the Rothschilds plunged the country
          into Civil War. He shows how Lincoln created a system allowing the
          U.S. to furnish its own money, without need for a Central Bank, and
          how this led to his assassination by a Rothschild agent. With Lincoln
          out of the picture, the Rothschilds were able to wipe out his
          prosperous monetary system, which plunged the country into high
          unemployment and recession and laid the foundation for the later
          formation of the Federal Reserve Bank--a banking scheme still in place
          in America today.
