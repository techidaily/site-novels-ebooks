            Reports of paranormal experiences vary tremendously, but are often
            associated with ghosts, haunted houses, and otherwise eerie
            circumstances. There exist both classic and modern texts on ghosts
            and haunted or possessed people, places and spaces; many discuss
            traditional ideas regarding such phenomena or utilize now-outdated
            research in highly academic and technical ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book offers a very different approach in reviews provided by a
            leading-edge research program devoted to who has ghostly experiences
            and why. With new insights both global in scale and
            multidisciplinary in scope, this collaboration by five researchers
            uncovers consistent evidence that anomalous experiences represent a
            very real "Haunted People Syndrome"--a term describing anomalous
            experiences that manifest recurrently to the same percipients and
            are interpreted as "ghostly"--with implications for future research
            across academia. The participation of new citizen scientists (the
            field investigators and researchers among us) is invited in
            furthering the exploration of paranormal mysteries. Photos and
            figures illustrating concepts and models are included, as is a
            glossary.

          “The work laid out in this book will remind people how seriously this
          field of research should be taken! Readers are given extremely well
          thought out ideas, insights, arguments, procedures, and investigation
          techniques. This book is sure to smash some of the tropes in the field
          of paranormal research, while reinforcing others. A solid foundation
          for any investigator and a fascinating read for enthusiasts of
          paranormal research—whatever it may eventually reveal about the nature
          of all things that go bump in the night.”—Steve Gonsalves, paranormal
          investigator, television host &amp; producer; executive producer and
          host of <i>Ghost Nation</i>; director of <i>The House In Between</i>
