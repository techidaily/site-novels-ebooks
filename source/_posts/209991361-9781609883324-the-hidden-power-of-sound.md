            Daily bombarded by the entire spectrum of sound, we are often
            unaware of its tremendous power—a power long known to the adepts and
            yogis East and West. Now, scientific research is uncovering the
            essential role sound plays in the structuring of matter. Find out
            how sound creates the patterns that form the framework of our world
            and how the seed sounds of the universe can be used to accelerate
            consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to explore the nature of sound, we will have to correlate
            the sciences of biology, atomic physics, chemistry, and mathematics
            because sound is the integrating phenomenon of life—the common
            denominator through which and by which everything else operates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elizabeth Clare Prophet writes “We don’t have to sit and wait for
            something to happen—for a deliverer, for the Word to incarnate. We
            don’t have to wait until we get past this struggle or that problem
            or this burden to realize God. Rather, we displace all of that which
            appears as struggle with the sounding of the Word where we are.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In The Hidden Power of Sound you not only review the ancient
            philosophy behind the power of sound, but you can see in the work of
            Hans Jenny the power of sound to not only create, but to create
            patterns reminiscent of yantras and ancient symbols.
