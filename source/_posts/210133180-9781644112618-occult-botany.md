          • Includes a dictionary of nearly 300 magical plants with descriptions
          of each plant’s scientific name, common names, elemental qualities,
          ruling planets, and zodiacal signatures, with commentary on
          medico-magical properties and uses <br /><br />• Explores methods of
          phytotherapy and plant magic, including the Paracelsian
          “transplantation of diseases,” ritual pacts with trees, the secret
          ingredients of witches’ ointments, and the composition of magical
          philters <br /><br />• Explains the occult secrets of phytogenesis,
          plant physiology, and plant physiognomy (classification of plants
          according to the doctrine of signatures) <br /><br />Merging the
          scientific discipline of botany with ancient, medieval, and
          Renaissance traditions of occult herbalism, this seminal guide was
          first published in French in 1902 as a textbook for students of
          Papus’s École hermétique and sparked a revival in the study of magical
          herbalism in early twentieth-century France. <br /><br />Author Paul
          Sédir, pseudonym of Yvon Le Loup (1871-1926), explains the occult
          secrets of phytogenesis (the esoteric origin and evolutionary
          development of the plant kingdom), plant physiology (the occult
          anatomy of plants), and plant physiognomy (classification of plants
          according to the doctrine of signatures). Unveiling the mysteries
          behind planetary and zodiacal attributions, he provides readers with
          the keys to make their own informed determinations of the astral
          properties of plants. Moving from theory into practice, Sédir explores
          various methods of phytotherapy and plant magic, including the
          Paracelsian “transplantation of diseases,” the secret ingredients of
          witches’ ointments, and the composition of magical philters.
          <br /><br />In the third section of the book, Sédir offers a
          dictionary of magical plants that covers nearly 300 plant species with
          descriptions of their astral signatures, occult properties, and
          medico-magical uses. Compiled from an array of rare sources and
          esoterica, this classic text includes a wealth of additional materials
          and supplemental charts and diagrams drawn from Sédir’s occult
          colleagues, all of whom adopted and expanded upon Sédir’s pioneering
          system of plant correspondences.

          “Reading <i>Occult Botany</i> was a deeply enjoyable experience that
          satisfied many diverse urges for botanical knowledge, from within one
          compendium.This strange and intriguing miscellany leads one through
          portals and fields, gardens and celestial realms. The plant entries
          are helpful for quickly finding zodiac and planetary correspondences;
          they also include a peppering of rare pieces of occult lore alongside
          many medicinal applications of old. The footnotes are very helpful and
          detailed, as are the charts, tables, and appendices within the book.
          It is a must-have for students and seekers who wish to blend the
          magical with the medicinal, the earth with the stars.”

        <p>
          Paul Sédir, pseudonym of Yvon Le Loup (1871-1926), was a pivotal gure
          of the fin-de-siècle French occult revival. He was a professor at the
          École hermétique and Faculté des sciences hermétiques in Paris under
          the directorship of Papus, his first spiritual mentor. He practiced
          magic with the alchemist Albert Poisson and was initiated into almost
          all of the secret societies that occult Paris had to offer. Under the
          name Tau Paul, he was consecrated bishop of Concorezzo in the Église
          gnostique de France. He wrote widely on traditions of magic,
          mysticism, and esotericism, publishing more than twenty books in
          French.
