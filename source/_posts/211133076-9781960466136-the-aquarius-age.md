              >What is the Aquarius Age and how will it affect our lives?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In this book, the author reveals the effects of the Zodiac's
            movements on planet Earth. We are departing from the Pisces Age and
            entering the Aquarius Age. This new Age will officially take place
            during the years <strong>2106</strong> - <strong>4212</strong>. The
            Aquarius Age-rays, which always arrive prior to the official Age,
            started in the year <strong>1638</strong>, with an insight by the
            scientist Galileo Galilei, who discovered that Earth and the other
            eight planets circulate around the sun, which is contrary to what
            was understood at the time.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>We are gradually departing from the Pisces Age...</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Every age lasts <strong>2106</strong> years. The Pisces sign is
            water, an age rich in education, inventions, and technologies based
            on water, transportation on water, dams, using liquids and fuels as
            energy sources. It's the age of men: divide and conquer with ego,
            control, wealth for individuals, consumer culture, corruptions,
            financial institutions, classes, monarchies, dictators, wars,
            borders, countries, states, and cities. It's the age of religions
            and material spirituality.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p><strong>...And entering the Aquarius Age.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Every age lasts <strong>2106</strong> years. The Aquarius sign is
            air, an age rich in advanced technologies based on air/gas pressure,
            aviation, and speed. It's the age of women and united communities
            with world peace. An age of revealing the truth with fast justice,
            civil revolutions, which will bring the power back to the masses. An
            age of simplicity, love, compassion,&nbsp;responsibility, civilian
            unity, without borders nor religions but free faith, spiritual
            healers, and mediums, in which people will meet their Creators, the
            aliens.
