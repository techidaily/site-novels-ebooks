            >This story of three men's work helping traumatized kids in one of
            America’s most underserved cities reveals how mindfulness tools can
            help children and communities not only survive but thrive</b
          ><br /><br />&nbsp;In this inspiring book, founders of The Holistic
          Life Foundation Ali Smith, Atman Smith, and Andres Gonzalez describe
          how they have spent the past twenty years teaching yoga, meditation,
          and breathwork to thousands of at-risk kids in Baltimore schools
          helping them to develop deep reserves of patience, empathy, resolve,
          and—when needed—the righteous anger that fuels deep structural
          change.&nbsp;Their work has received wide national attention due to
          their remarkable results: The schools that have participated in their
          programs have seen suspension rates plummet and graduation rates go
          through the roof.<br />&nbsp;<br />Ali and Atman discovered as young
          children the power of mindfulness practices to sustain them through
          the challenges of growing up in a neighborhood in Baltimore that was
          struggling with poverty and violence—a community they now
          serve.&nbsp;The Holistic Life Foundation’s mission is to empower kids
          to find this same stillness and light within themselves and to let it
          shine out to help change the world. In this book, Ali, Atman and
          Andres share hands-on mindfulness and meditation tools readers can
          teach kids that will empower them to do this same work in their own
          communities. <i>Let Your Light Shine</i> is essential reading for
          parents, educators, activists, and anyone looking to make a difference
          in the lives of young people.<br />

          "These guys are my heroes. For years, they have brought meditation and
          yoga to the children of struggling communities in Baltimore — work
          that repeated rounds of scientific research have shown to be immensely
          beneficial. Now, in this book, they show you how to work with your own
          mind, with the minds of the kids in your life, and with a world that
          can be both beautiful and cruel. Check it out."&nbsp;<br /><b

          ><br /><br /><br />"How to change a world so challenged by mistrust,
          trauma and systematic racism? <i>Let your Light Shine</i> is a primer
          written with heart, honesty and truth. It is written for all who take
          the time to really care. It reveals how a difference&nbsp;can be made
          if we look within and change ourselves first. Then we can help the
          next generation with love, listening and learned skills.&nbsp; Ali,
          Altman and Andres speak with profound experience and give us the very
          tools we need."<br /><b
