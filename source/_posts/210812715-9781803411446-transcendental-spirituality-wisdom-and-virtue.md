            In the face of potentially cataclysmic challenges and existential
            threats to both humanity and the planet, it is timely for this
            generation to recall and then live by forgotten or ignored universal
            ethical principles and virtues. Transcendental Spirituality, Wisdom
            and Virtue: The Divine Virtues and Treasures of the Heart identifies
            and explores 36 such principles that represent divine virtues or
            universal ethical principles. Supported by relevant scriptural
            passages from various faiths such as Baha'i, Buddhism, Christianity,
            Confucianism, Hinduism, Indigenous spiritual beliefs, Islam,
            Jainism, Judaism, Shintoism, Sikhism, Taoism and Zoroastrianism,
            each chapter is devoted to exploring and synthesizing the essence of
            the scriptural meaning and scope of one Divine Virtue. While
            previous works have focussed generally on ancient wisdom, this book
            extends beyond wisdom to include 35 additional virtues or spiritual
            principles that underpin these great and diverse religions.

          Our religious beliefs, despite predictions that they would disappear
          from our lives, continue to play an important part in contemporary
          society. Religious faith provides society with cohesion and solidarity
          and sense of community through shared beliefs, together with social
          influence which promotes moral, ethical and empathetic behaviour in
          society. More importantly, it offers meaning and purpose in answering
          existential questions, particularly in a pandemic environment, with
          many of us now thinking about our mortality. Yet there are distressing
          consequences arising from differing religious beliefs and practices as
          evidenced by the countless wars and conflicts that have had an overt
          or covert religious dimension throughout history and increasingly to
          the present day. Sadly, today we live in a time of increasing
          prejudice and persecution with the followers of most major religions
          reporting increasing hostility and, in many cases, violence. What the
          author has achieved in Transcendental Spirituality, Wisdom and Virtue:
          The Divine Virtues and Treasures of the Heart through an extensive
          comparative listing of each of the universal principles and divine
          virtues, is to show the reader that regardless of the origin of our
          beliefs, the sacred scriptures provide us universally with wisdom,
          holiness, inspiration and spiritual nourishment. Clearly the author
          has achieved a primary objective in writing by assisting readers to
          reflect on their own spirituality and faith but more importantly to
          understand and appreciate the spiritual unity across our individual
          beliefs. At no time in history has it been more important to take time
          to learn about our neighbours' culture and beliefs. This book will
          greatly assist us in commencing this important journey.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Douglas Hodgson's involvement with legal education and university
          administration has spanned over four decades in Canada, England,
          Australia and New Zealand. As a lawyer, teacher, researcher, author
          and human rights advocate, his interest in religious discrimination
          and religious fundamentalism issues motivated him to engage in the
          study of the scriptures of the world's religions, ultimately inspiring
          him to write "Transcendental Spirituality, Wisdom and Virtue: The
          Divine Virtues and Treasures of the Heart". He lives in Perth,
          Australia.
