          A full-color, practical handbook on the bioenergetics of animal
          healing, with case studies to showcase the effects of vibrational
          medicine <br /><br />• 2020 Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold
          Award and Industry Choice and Peoples Choice Award <br /><br />•
          Reveals how to work with the energy fields, auras, and chakras of
          horses, cats, and dogs <br /><br />• Demonstrates how to use High
          Sense Perception (HSP) in relation to an animal, illustrating what
          happens in the energy fields of a human being and an animal when they
          connect telepathically <br /><br />• Details how zoopharmacognosy, or
          animal self-selection of remedies such as essential oils, can assist
          in promoting emotional release and physical healing
          <br /><br />Vibrational medicine offers a natural, effective, and
          hands-on response to animal ailments and disturbances. In the absence
          of a shared language of “words,” energetic healing can connect a human
          more closely to an animal while at the same time working on the
          physical body, the chakras, and the different layers of the animal’s
          aura or energy field. <br /><br />In this book, animal communicator
          and healer Diane Budd shares her intriguing journey, research, and
          experience of working with animals energetically. She explains how,
          together with a healer colleague, she set out to document the effects
          of animal communication and healing on the energy field of the animal
          and the communicator, which led to further in-depth research.
          Detailing her findings, she reveals how to work with the energy
          fields, auras, and chakras of horses, cats, and dogs as well as what
          benefits energetic healing work can offer to animals. Sharing many
          case studies from her healing practice, the author explores what High
          Sense Perception (HSP) reveals about the relationship between an
          animal and human and how to make sense of what you are receiving on an
          intuitive level. Full-color illustrations clearly show the energy
          field, the energy flow between animals’ chakras, and what happens in
          the energy fields of a human being and an animal when they connect
          telepathically. The illustrations also help guide you, step-by-step,
          through the use of the healing tools and practices described.
          <br /><br />The author explains how zoopharmacognosy--animal
          self-selection of remedies such as essential oils or herbs--can
          support emotional release and physical healing, not only for animals
          but for humans too. She details animal personality types and their
          soul evolvement levels and explores the influence of an animal’s past
          life on present-day issues, whether it be a past-life connection with
          the current owner or an issue the animal needs to work with in this
          present lifetime. <br /><br />Full of animal communication stories and
          ground-breaking research on animal energy fields, this book shows how,
          just as we humans are all here on this earthly plane to learn and
          grow, so are our animals.
