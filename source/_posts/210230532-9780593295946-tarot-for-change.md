              ><b>“</b>An instant classic, a must-have for every tarot
              enthusiast, and a manifesto for insightful living.”&nbsp;—Chani
              Nicholas, astrologer and author of
              <i>You Were Born for This<br /><br /></i>“Generous, practical, and
              gently radical.”
              <i
                ><i><b>—New York Times</b></i></i
              ><br /><br />Though tarot is often thought of as a tool for
              divination and fortune-telling, it also has deep roots in
              spirituality and psychology. For those who know how to see and
              listen, the cards hold the potential to help us better navigate
              the full spectrum of the human experience.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />In <i>Tarot for Change</i>, Jessica Dore divulges years
          of hard-won secrets about how to work with tarot to better understand
          ourselves and live in alignment with what’s precious. Dore shows
          readers how to choose a deck, interpret images, and build a
          relationship with the cards, while also demonstrating how the mythic
          imagery of tarot supports modern therapeutic concepts like
          mindfulness, acceptance, and compassion. Her reflections on each of
          the seventy-eight cards are a vibrant tapestry that weaves together
          ideas from psychology, behavioral science, spirituality, and old
          stories, breathing new language into ancient wisdoms about what it
          means to be human.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This is as much a book for those who are new to tarot as it is for
          those who have worked with the cards for years. And it's a book for
          anyone interested in exploring what it means to experience joy,
          heartbreak, wonder, stagnation, grief, loneliness, love. A book of
          secrets, symbols, and stories, <i>Tarot for Change</i> is a charm for
          remembering that our problems are not new, we are never alone, and
          whether we know it or not, we are always in a process of change.

          “<i>Tarot for Change</i> won me over with its generous, practical, and
          gently radical advice. Dore repeatedly invokes the principles of
          dialectical behavior therapy (though she does not practice
          psychotherapy herself) and its emphasis on holding multiple, even
          apparently contradictory truths at once. ‘Holding paradox,’ she
          writes, ‘remains the continual lesson of tarot.’ No one and nothing is
          all good or all bad—no monster, no witch, not even ourselves.”<br /><i
            ><b>—New York Times</b></i
          ><br /><br />“While tarot readers are fairly common online, Dore is
          unique in her methods, combining more traditional aspects of tarot
          reading with behavioral psychology. Her multi-disciplinary approach to
          the cards indeed adds new context to the avenues of healing and
          self-exploration that tarot has always offered, and the results are
          often exceptionally effective.”<br /><i><b>—Nylon</b><br /><br />“</i
          >Like all good mystics, Jessica Dore sits at the doorway between two
          worlds: She’s both a licensed social worker and a professional reader
          and interpreter of the tarot. . . . <i>Tarot for Change</i> isn’t
          meant to be a manual or a how-to, exactly. It’s a thought experiment,
          the opening of a dialogue, and a series of questions to be
          entertained. Change is itself a liminal space, the passage between
          here and there, and Dore’s hope is that the book will help readers use
          their decks for deep exploration that’s informed by both the ancient
          and the modern, and the mythic and the scientific.”<br />
          <b>—Shondaland</b><br /><br />“Dore offers up thoughtful life lessons
          inspired by the symbols and historical meaning of each card.&nbsp;. .
          . [Dore has woven] a tapestry of ideas you’re liable to return to,
          again and again.”<br /><b>—Oprah Daily</b><br />&nbsp;<br />
          “With this practical, carefully referenced guide, Dore brings together
          the scientific and the arcane, two spheres long believed to be
          antithetical­—but increasingly less so. . . . Even if magic is a leap
          too far, in ‘reclaiming the imagination from the grips of doubt and
          rationalism,’ tarot may at least allow us to imagine a better world:
          the first step to creating it.”<br />
          <i><b>—The Guardian</b><br /><br />“Tarot for Change</i> is an instant
          classic, a must-have for every tarot enthusiast, and a manifesto for
          insightful living. Jessica Dore is a lighthouse whose wisdom permeates
          every page and a teacher who brings to life her subject with
          undeniable skill and depth.”<br />

          “Jessica Dore has replicated (in wonderfully literary book form) the
          most expansive, juicy, intuitive, and transformative tarot session.
          She’s integrated so much wisdom&nbsp;from all kinds of traditions to
          make the spiritual feel splendidly accessible and the universal feel
          warmly personal. For people who think they’re not spiritual enough for
          tarot, Dore has created a very useful psychological framework from the
          card’s lessons, with plenty of research and insight to back it up. For
          those who feel a little too woo-woo for psychology, she’s presented
          the concepts with such artistry and soul that all will feel welcome.
          And that’s the gift that Dore has given us in <i>Tarot for Change</i>:
          the gift of feeling more welcome to the tarot, more welcome on our
          healing journey, and more welcome in our own lives.”<br />

          book: one that contains magical hidden depths, and rewards careful
          readers with truly astounding wisdom and generosity. Jessica Dore
          combines ancient spirituality with modern psychology to share insights
          that feel both timeless and brand new. <i>Tarot for Change </i>will
          teach you about tarot, but also about yourself, and all the joy,
          heartache, and mystery of being human.”<br />

          “<i>Tarot for Change</i> is a wondrously inviting book from a writer
          who envelops any reader—from the curious and the amateurish to the
          refined and masterly—into her prose and knowledge. Though this is a
          written document, the words are the kind that settle into the grooves
          of your spirit and encourage you to reconnect with the unseen in order
          to find new discoveries about what is seen.”<br />

          >“This is not so much a book as it is a collection of doorways. By
          uniquely cross-stitching spirituality, psychology, and behavioral
          science, Jessica Dore centers tarot as a practice to ‘place us back
          into a mythic context.’ Through her guidance, tarot becomes a verb, a
          sensitive conversation ripe with symbolism, possibility, and
          sacredness. <i>Tarot for Change</i> is a choose-your-own-adventure
          self-help book that eggs us on like a mischievous and wise best
          friend. Dore wants us liberated. To get us there, she fans an empathic
          resourcefulness, utilizing ancient myths and modern physics alike.
          Dore’s deep respect for human vulnerability and the power of tarot to
          support us perfumes every page. Yet, among the various theories and
          tools she offers, a respect for mystery permeates. Gently, she reminds
          us, ‘Something immeasurable moves us along.’ Endless doorways require
          endless trust. Dore is a gentle and generous shepherd.”<br />

          “I’ve long awaited a book like <i>Tarot for Change,</i> a template for
          a tarot novice or observer. Jessica Dore&nbsp;brings you into the
          allegory, the storytelling, into the abstract as well the imaginal,
          while giving a condensed explanation of what each card has
          the&nbsp;potential to mean. I’ve noticed those&nbsp;who are drawn to
          tarot are people who seek solace in the mysteries of life and who aim
          to understand&nbsp;themselves through the paradigms of the oracles,
          knowing there’s wisdom in observation and tracking symbols. Dore helps
          aid this process by synthesizing the deck, displaying a
          resilient&nbsp;servitude in her dedication to teach what she has
          learned on her path through her study of
          psychology,&nbsp;incorporating&nbsp;this perspective into the journey
          of the cards. This book is an incredibly important handbook for those
          invested in the ritual of tarot and healing. Particularly those who
          are hungry for change and want to break through&nbsp;patterns to see
          themselves a little more clearly, with Dore’s help. I sincerely love
          this book.” <br />

          >“Jessica&nbsp;Dore’s unique reading of the tarot has opened a new
          realm of possibilities for psychological growth and behavioral change.
          Her interpretations of the cards in conjunction with her psychological
          background are the perfect combination for the needs of our current
          times: facing hard truths, sitting with discomfort, and learning to
          see hope and potential in the midst our often challenging lives. This
          book has renewed my love for the tarot, specifically because of the
          way Dore brings the images to life for me in a new way, and ties the
          images into profound meditations on the hidden aspect of our psyche.
          It is practical, useful, inspirational, and is bound to be a go-to for
          tarot lovers for years to come.”<br /><b

          >“Times being what they are, an uptick in conversation around
          self-care and coping with grief feels appropriate. We’re all, it
          seems, looking for ways to make sense of, or at least soften, our
          experience of the everyday, and in this climate, interest in the
          ancient practice of tarot is resurgent. I’m among the curious dabblers
          who are digging deeper, and I’m glad to learn from Jessica Dore’s
          <i>Tarot for Change</i>. . . . Dore, a licensed social worker, roots
          her study of tarot in psychology, but she also pulls from folk
          traditions, personal anecdotes, mythology, literature and much more
          for a depth-charged exploration of the major and minor arcana. Tarot,
          her book suggests, deserves to be seen as a therapeutic modality like
          any other. ‘Efforts to boil the study of the soul down to a science
          have led to great strides in the treatment of mental illness,’ she
          writes, ‘but have relegated mystery and magic to the edges.’”<br /><i
