          • Explains the Dark Man phenomenon through centuries-old folklore and
          mythology, testimony from British witch trials, and modern accounts<br /><br />•
          Challenges the simplistic concept of the Devil as “evil,” explaining
          how encounters with this entity can reveal one’s life purpose and how
          the Dark Man can be an initiator into witchcraft<br /><br />• Presents
          interviews with those who have witnessed the Dark Man firsthand,
          offering insights into how he can serve as a guide to a more positive
          life<br /><br />From the fortean phantoms that terrorized Victorian
          England to the haunted crossroads of the Irish hinterlands, the
          Devil—also known as the Dark Man—has found countless novel ways to
          influence culture and bring us face to face with our fears. Tracing
          this enigmatic entity through the centuries via mythology, folklore,
          occult writings, and modern accounts, Darragh Mason shows how the Dark
          Man is more than just a myth: he is a real presence in our world.<br /><br />Drawing
          on Irish manuscripts dating back to the 12th century, testimony from
          17th-century Scottish witches, his own experiences, and interviews
          with contemporary witches and mystics, Mason builds the case for the
          pattern of the Dark Man phenomenon, showing what his presence can
          mean, what it’s like for those who experience him, and how his
          appearance serves as a calling to the path of witchcraft. In doing so,
          Mason challenges conventional understandings of the Dark Man as an
          evil presence, emphasizing his role in questioning authority and
          liberating individuals from the confines of strict social convention.
          He shows how the Dark Man’s presence serves as a potent illustrator of
          the battles between light and dark.<br /><br />But, Mason emphasizes,
          these stories of the Dark Man are not necessarily just folktales.
          Sharing a series of interviews with contemporary figures, including
          Orion Foxwood and Peter Grey, who speak of the nature of this spirit
          and their experiences with him, the author illustrates how encounters
          with the Dark Man can challenge you to make changes—often painful
          ones—and how if you meet his challenges, you may be bestowed with
          mystical gifts and initiated into witchcraft. Ultimately, Mason shows
          how the Dark Man may be a liberating figure: if one faces him and
          moves beyond the fear, he can open the door to a richer, more
          fulfilling, and more magical life.
