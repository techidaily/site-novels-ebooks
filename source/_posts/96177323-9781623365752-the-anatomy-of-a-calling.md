          We are all, every single one of us, heroes. We are all on what Joseph
          Campbell calls “a hero’s journey;” we are all on a mission to step
          into our true nature and fulfill the assignment our souls were sent to
          Earth to fulfill. Navigating the hero’s journey, Lissa Rankin, MD,
          argues, is one of the cornerstones of living a meaningful, authentic,
          healthy life.<br /><br />In clear, engaging prose, Lissa describes her
          entire spiritual journey for the first time--beginning with what she
          calls her “perfect storm” of events--and recounts the many
          transformative experiences that led to a profound awakening of her
          soul. Through her father’s death, her daughter’s birth, career
          victories and failures, and an ongoing struggle to identify as both a
          doctor and a healer, Lissa discovers a powerful self-awareness.
          <br /><br />As she shares her story, she encourages you to find out
          where you are on your own journey, offering inspiring guideposts and
          practices along the way. With compelling lessons on trusting
          intuition, surrendering to love, and learning to see adversity as an
          opportunity for soul growth, <i>The Anatomy of a Calling </i>invites
          you to make a powerful shift in consciousness and reach your highest
          destiny.

          “Poignant and powerful, this book works equally as a memoir and a
          self-help guide. Yet there is also an undefinable third thing within
          its covers. It isn't only a guide to the transition into one's
          calling. Potentially it is itself part of that transition, shifting
          reality for those who read it.” —<i
            >Charles Eisenstein, author of The More Beautiful World Our Hearts
            Know Is Possible</i
          ><br /><br />“If you combined Elizabeth Gilbert's Eat, Pray, Love,
          Cheryl Strayed's Wild, and James Redfield's The Celestine Prophecy,
          you'd get Lissa Rankin's The Anatomy of a Calling. Although this book
          is about Lissa and her story, you won't doubt for one minute that it's
          really about you and your story. Much more than a memoir, this is a
          road map for those on the spiritual path who sense that they're being
          called to fulfill a sacred mission. Loaded with nurturing comfort
          along with practical tools for navigating your hero's journey, this
          book will help you become a miracle worker at a time when we need
          miracles!” —<i
            >Marci Shimoff, New York Times bestselling author of Happy for No
            Reason</i
          ><br /><br />“Lissa Rankin has written a brave, deeply personal book.
          We all struggle with finding our purpose—yet we all have hidden
          strengths that can be uncovered and set free. <i>The</i>
          <i>Anatomy of a Calling </i>is the practical guide to bringing greater
          meaning to our lives.” —<i
            >Chris Guillebeau, New York Times bestselling author of The $100
            Startup and The Happiness of Pursuit</i
          ><br /><br />“In this memoir Lissa Rankin MD offers us a deeply honest
          and personal account of The Hero’s Journey, the universal path each of
          us travels towards an authentic life. At critical steps of the way she
          shares Guideposts and Practices to help us each travel our own Hero’s
          Journey to our own unique destination. Anatomy of a calling is a gift,
          a companion for the road for anyone who feels they are traveling
          uncharted territory alone.” —<i
            >Rachel Naomi Remen MD, Author, Kitchen Table Wisdom and My
            Grandfather’s Blessings</i
          ><br /><br />“Every once in awhile a book comes along that feels like
          that companion you've been longing for to hold your hand on the
          incredible journey of life. Lissa Rankin has beautifully written
          <i>The Anatomy of a Calling </i>for you to transform your desire to do
          and be more into knowing, once and for all, your sacred purpose for
          being here. Enjoy this heartfelt journey as you realize that you are
          the hero in the story she shares.” —<i
            >Kristine Carlson, co-author to the Don't Sweat the Small Stuff
            books</i
          ><br /><br />“I made the mistake of starting The Anatomy of a Calling
          near bedtime. Don’t do this unless you are willing to lose a lot of
          sleep! Lissa’s story is absolutely riveting, moving and so wise. Read
          this book and be awakened to all that life wants for you.” —<i
            >Jennifer Louden, author of The Woman’s Comfort Book and A Year of
            Daily Joy</i
          ><br /><br />“A poignant, courageous and soul-stirring invitation to
          your own unique true-path. What is so magnificent about this book is
          that it refuses to distinguish a life emblazoned with sacred purpose
          from a life of vulnerable and deep feeling. Our true-path is not a
          head-trip, not a quest for egoic glory, not a hyped up stage show, it
          is a journey to and through the heart, a resonant return to the
          callings and pathways encoded in the bones of our being. We spend too
          much time listening to the misidentified outer world, while our
          greater story is hungrily laying in wait within us. Read Lissa's brave
          story of unfolding, and you will surely awaken your own. By the time
          you finish this book, the soulular phone will be ringing off the hook,
          reminding you of why you are here. Answer the bloody phone!” —<i
            >Jeff Brown, author of Soulshaping and An Uncommon Bond</i
          ><br /><br />“Callings do not go away no matter how long it takes, how
          scared you feel or how much you try to resist. Lissa's brilliant and
          very wise book is a vulnerably powerfull support and catalyst for you
          discovering your calling, and living and being your calling.” —<i
            >SARK artist &amp; author Succulent Wild LOVE</i
          ><br /><br />“Lissa Rankin is the real deal. The Anatomy of a Calling
          made me cry and laugh...it is so honest and brave. More than a memoir,
          this beautifully crafted book is a fearless guide to the Great
          Unknown. The simple practices that Lissa suggests at the end of each
          chapter are portals to your own inner guidance. Gentle, hopeful, and
          clear...this book is destined to become a classic.” —<i
