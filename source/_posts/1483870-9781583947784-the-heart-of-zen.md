            >A Zen teacher shares his unique&nbsp;take on enlightenment,
            emotional maturity, and the integration required to take one's seat
            in true liberation</b
          ><br /><br />While we are more and more familiar with popular ideas of
          enlightenment and spiritual awakening, life still comes at us full
          force, and hope can turn to frustration as the gulf between our
          spiritual belief and our everyday life seems to loom ever larger.
          Through spirited Q&amp;A sessions with Zen master Jun Po Denis Kelly
          Roshi, <i>The Heart of Zen </i>takes a gradual, step-by-step approach
          to what has become a vexing problem in spiritual circles.
          <br /><br />What is missing is <i>integration. </i> If awakening truly
          transforms every part of the life of a person, where are we getting
          stuck? How can negative emotions like anger, shame, envy, and jealousy
          continue to arise? How do our relative egos relate to the Zen teaching
          of Emptiness, and what does this mean for our intimate relationships,
          our emotional bodies, our views of the world and its problems?
          <br /><br /><i>The Heart of Zen </i>represents the next generation of
          spiritual books because it addresses awakening and spiritual life
          within the context of creating lasting change through the integration
          of spiritual insight into the flow and flux of everyday life. Jun Po
          Denis Kelly Roshi explains how well trained meditation students may
          learn to be nonreactive to emotions, but they seldom learn how to
          transform their negative emotions (and the ego that holds them) as
          part of a more deeply integrated, lived spirituality. Part discussion
          and part experimental guide, <i>The Heart of Zen</i> book describes
          precisely what this means in great detail and with exercises for the
          reader to follow.

          “This is one of the most important works on spiritual realization to
          be written in years. &nbsp;It’s based on Jun Po Kelly Roshi’s
          breakthrough insights into how to distill and dramatically accelerate
          the koan practice of Zen—and thus dramatically accelerate the
          awakening process in consciousness. &nbsp;There’s really nothing like
          this out there, and no matter what your ‘official’ spiritual
          orientation, you really can’t afford to miss this revolutionary
          process for your own awakening and enlightenment. &nbsp;My absolutely
          highest recommendation!”<br />—Ken Wilber, author of&nbsp;<i
