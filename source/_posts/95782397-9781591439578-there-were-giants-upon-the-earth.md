          The crowning work of the best-selling Earth Chronicles series <br />
          <br />• Reveals the existence of physical evidence of alien presence
          on Earth in the distant past <br />
          <br />• Identifies and describes the demigods, such as Gilgamesh,
          descended from these visitors <br />
          <br />• Outlines the tests of this physical evidence of alien presence
          that could unlock the secrets of health, longevity, life, and death
          <br />
          <br />In whose genetic image were we made? From his first book
          <i>The 12th Planet</i> on, Zecharia Sitchin has asserted that the
          Bible’s <i>Elohim</i> who said “Let us fashion The Adam in our image
          and after our likeness” were the gods of Sumer and Babylon--the
          Anunnaki who had come to Earth from their planet Nibiru. The Adam, he
          wrote, was genetically engineered by adding Anunnaki genes to those of
          an existing hominid, some 300,000 years ago. Then, according to the
          Bible, intermarriage took place: “There were giants upon the Earth”
          who took Adam’s female offspring as wives, giving birth to “heroes of
          renown.” With meticulous detail, Sitchin shows that these were the
          demigods of Sumerian and Babylonian lore, such as the famed
          Mesopotamian king Gilgamesh as well as the hero of the Deluge, the
          Babylonian Utnapishtim. <br />
          <br /><b>Are we then, all of us, descendants of demigods?</b> In this
          crowning oeuvre, Zecharia Sitchin proceeds step-by-step through a mass
          of ancient writings and artifacts, leading the reader to the stunning
          Royal Tombs of Ur. He reveals a DNA source that could prove the
          biblical and Sumerian tales true, providing conclusive physical
          evidence for past alien presence on Earth and an unprecedented
          scientific opportunity to track down the “Missing Link” in humankind’s
          evolution, unlocking the secrets of longevity and even the ultimate
          mystery of life and death.

          “Drawing on a vast range of scholarship as well has his [Zechariah
          Sitchin] grasp of ancient languages and archaeology, he asserts that
          two of the tombs of Ur contained the remains of an Annunaki goddess
          Puabi, which actually still exist in the Natural History Museum. . .
          an intriguing story.”

        <p>
          Eminent biblical scholar and internationally acclaimed author Zecharia
          Sitchin (1920-2010) spent 60 years researching and translating
          Sumerian clay tablets and other ancient texts that identify the
          Anunnaki and their planet, Nibiru. A journalist and editor in Israel
          for many years, he later made his home in New York City.
