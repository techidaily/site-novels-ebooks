          A guide to co-creating a healing vision for humanity and the Earth
          through nature-connected shamanic rituals <br /><br />• Explains the
          Earth Spirit Dreaming process for rebirthing inherent shamanic
          abilities with dozens of practices in three categories:
          Earth-connecting practices, Spirit-connecting practices, and
          Dream-connecting practices <br /><br />• Provides experiential
          exercises to foster interactions with the intelligences and elemental
          energies of nature and the Spirit realm, realign you with the rhythms
          and flow of life, and co-create a healing dream for humanity and all
          of life on our planet <br /><br />• Contains step-by-step directions
          for connecting with the light guides of the planet for guidance and
          healing <br /><br />Humanity has become profoundly disconnected from
          the web of life on Earth as well as from nature as a whole. In this
          practical guide, Elizabeth E. Meacham details her field-tested method
          of shamanic ecotherapy practices to resolve this centuries-long trend
          toward disconnection. Through these practices, you will learn how to
          reconnect to Earth’s systems and help restore health and balance to
          people and the planet. <br /><br />Translating transformative ideas
          from visionary environmental thinkers into engaging shamanic rituals
          for profound spiritual growth, Meacham offers dozens of practices in
          three categories: Earth-connecting practices, Spirit-connecting
          practices, and Dream-connecting practices. Building on one another,
          the exercises open channels to allow you to directly experience the
          intelligences of the Earth and Spirit realms, rebirth your inherent
          shamanic abilities, realign you with the rhythms and flow of life, and
          reclaim your ancestral power for co-creating a healing dream for our
          species and all of life on our planetary home. Guiding the reader
          through a progressively deepening journey toward connection with
          ourselves, each other, and the consciousness of our biosphere, the
          practices also invite profound mindfulness, as we work to hold a
          vision of connection with the Earth and Spirit realms, while choosing
          consciously to focus on joy, beauty, gratitude, love, and healing.
          <br /><br />Illuminating a shamanic awakening within Western culture
          at the dawn of an ecological age, <i>Earth Spirit Dreaming</i> reveals
          how the birth of a global consciousness of healing depends upon our
          commitment to individual and collective spiritual evolution. Calling
          us back to our shamanic heritage of a living nature spirituality, this
          manual offers much needed guidance on the essential journey back to an
          intimate love of Earth.

          “It’s almost cliché to realize that reconnecting to the Earth is of
          paramount importance if humanity--or some significant portion
          thereof--is to survive and thrive into the next century. But an
          intellectual realization is only a first step. We need to practice
          having an ongoing <i>felt sense</i> of this connection. Elizabeth
          Meacham offers a dazzling, just-in-the-nick-of-time collection of
          practices to do just that.”
