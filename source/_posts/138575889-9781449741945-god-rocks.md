          As I researched for the economy of Jesus, I came across an interesting
          discovery. The diet of the Israelites had dramatically changed from
          meat to fish. When you follow Jesus around the Sea of Galilee, you
          realize most of Jesus disciples were fishermen, and the two miracles
          of feeding the 4,000 and 5,000 were involved with fish and bread, and
          people from the neighboring ten towns flocked to Galilee for His
          healing, preaching, and an easy living. I was not surprised that the
          Israelites consumed fish extensively. It was Jesus way of creating
          that exuberant fish industry to draw people to Him and incubate more
          Christians than ever. He has promised us through the whole Bible that
          whoever believes in Him will have an eternal and abundant life. Today,
          I am not lacking because I have discovered His secret and would like
          to share it with you. But first thing first: believe every word in the
          Bible. Some Christians may have heard of Qumran, commonly called the
          Dead Sea Scrolls, which prove the authenticity of the Hebrew and
          Aramaic manuscripts of the Old Testament and the rest of the books in
          the Bible, but they may not have realized that hundreds of credited
          evangelical leaders, theologians, and scholars had agreed and signed
          off on the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy. If you know the
          Bible we have in our hand today has gone through a long process of
          canonization, then you will look at it differently, and you will
          believe every word it says. If you want that spiritually and
          physically abundant life, you have to believe every word it says. Look
          at the Biblical Patriarchs, did they have abundant lives or
          second-rate ones? Yes, we could have a better life, the secret is in
          God Rocks!
