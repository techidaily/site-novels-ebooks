          <b>Shocking true stories of those who walk among us . . .</b
          ><br /><br />With the Kepler satellite observatory detecting new
          planets at an unprecedented rate and the powerful computers at NASA’s
          Ames Research Center seeking signs of distant life, will a
          breakthrough discovery happen shortly—or has there already been a
          secret encounter with alien beings? Who might be coming next? And who
          walks among us today?
          <p>
            Visits from otherworldly creatures, aliens living among us,
            abductions of humans to alien spacecraft, and accounts of
            interstellar cooperation since the UFO crash in Roswell are
            thoroughly investigated in
            <b
              ><i
                >Real Aliens, Space Beings, and Creatures from Other Worlds</i
              ></b
            >. Paranormal researcher extraordinaire Brad Steiger, an author of
            thousands of books and articles on the mysterious and unknown, looks
            into a wide host of otherworldly encounters from alleged eyewitness
            accounts of extraterrestrial beings working side by side with human
            scientists to the uncomfortable accusations of alien abductions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Disquieting testimonials, enlightening news articles, informative
            historical accounts and documents, this book chronicles more than
            300 examples of alien encounters, conspiracy theories, and the
            influence of extraterrestrials on human events throughout history.
            This discussion of the theories and mysteries surrounding aliens is
            packed with thought-provoking stories and shocking revelations of
            alien involvement in the lives of Earthlings, such as … Three
            Russian scientists who were monitoring the Apollo Moon Landing on
            July 20, 1969 claim that astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin were being
            closely observed by UFOs; Thousands of women all over the world
            claim to have been abducted for the purpose of bearing Hybrid
            Children; A family in Colorado repeatedly visited by aliens—with
            physical evidence and photographs to prove their story.
          </p>
          <p>
            From cattle and human mutilations to missing time experienced by UFO
            experiences, and from secret underground and even underwater alien
            facilities to government-alien conspiracies, each astonishing report
            is detailed with thorough research and recounted with a
            storyteller’s crafted voice.

            will leave the reader wondering who has visited us; who's coming to
            visit next; and who walks among us.
