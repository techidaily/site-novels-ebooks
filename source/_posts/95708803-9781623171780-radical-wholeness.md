          There are qualities we all yearn to experience in our lives—peace,
          simplicity, grace, connection, clarity. Yet these qualities evade us
          because each of them arises from an experience of wholeness, and we
          live in a culture that enforces divisions within each of us. In
          <i>Radical Wholeness,</i> Philip Shepherd shows the countless ways in
          which we are persuaded to separate from the body and live in the head.
          Disconnected from the body’s intelligence, we also disconnect from the
          wholeness of the present. This schism within us is the primary source
          of stress not just in our personal lives, but for the systems of the
          planet.<br /><br />Drawing from neuroscience, anthropology, physics,
          the arts, myth, personal stories and his experiences helping people
          around the world to experience wholeness, Philip Shepherd illuminates
          what true wholeness means and offers practices designed to help
          readers soften into the intelligence of the body.
          <i>Radical Wholeness </i>is a call to action: to recover wholeness and
          experience a new way of being.

          “Philip Shepherd has gifted us a book that reframes our basic
          understanding of getting the most out of body intelligence. It
          rearranges the familiar top-down authorship from cerebral brain to
          body and restores body presence to a borderless merging of
          intelligence that includes inside/outside and sensory awareness.
          Ingest this book and let it ruminate throughout your daily dance. Take
          Shepherd’s experiences to heart and practice the exercises he shares
          with us to reclaim our inheritance as fully functional breathing
          sensing alive awake beings.”<br />
          —Vinn Arjuna Martí, Designer of Soul Motion®. A conscious dance
          practice.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>“Radical Wholeness</i> is an important book. It’s a “deep dive”
          into understanding our&nbsp; somatic&nbsp; experience of being and
          provides a path back to wholeness. And for students of the Enneagram,
          this is a book not to be missed. You’ll be amazed and delighted by how
          what Shepherd reveals so exquisitely adds to the exploration of the
          three centers of intelligence.”<br />
          —Curt Micka, President of the International Enneagram Association
          (IEA). (The opinions&nbsp; expressed here are not an endorsement by
          the IEA.)<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “With words of shimmering clarity, Philip Shepherd blows the door
          between body and mind off its hinges. Calling us with rigor,
          sensitivity, wisdom and imagination towards a future grounded in
          resurrected human capacities of awareness, he shows not only why but
          also how to develop those capacities, awakening intelligence we didn’t
          know we had. <i>Radical Wholeness</i> is sorely needed and
          sweet-tasting medicine for a fragmented world.”<br />
          —Amnon Buchbinder, author, <i>Biology of Story,</i> Professor of
          Screenwriting, York University<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This very wise book shows why it is impossible and ultimately
          suicidal to attempt to secede from&nbsp; nature, as our&nbsp;
          culture&nbsp; has tried to do through denying our oneness and
          wholeness with the world. We are nature, and there is no ‘out there’
          that exists independently from our consciousness, our knowing. As Max
          Planck, the founder of quantum physics put it, ‘We cannot get behind
          consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we
          regard as existing, postulates consciousness’—for consciousness, he
          said, is ‘fundamental.’ But do not think&nbsp; <i>Radical</i>
          <i>Wholeness</i> is merely a philosophical treatise. It is a practical
          blueprint for embodying information in the service of human welfare
          and survival. Our future depends on the vision Philip Shepherd
          powerfully and eloquently presents in <i>Radical Wholeness.”</i><br />
          —Larry Dossey, MD, author,
          <i

            Consciousness and Why It Matters</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In a culture as broken and fragmented as ours, this book is painfully
          overdue. Going beyond outdated notions of ‘holistic,’ Philip Shepherd
          has captured the essence of individual embodiment&nbsp; and its
          inextricable connection with everyone and everything. What our world
          desperately needs now are not more smart homo sapiens, but fully
          present and embodied holo sapiens who feel and&nbsp; live in grounded
          inter-relatedness. In this book, Shepherd has provided us with an
          extraordinary tool kit that tenderly and skillfully integrates&nbsp;
          mind, body, and soul with all life in the universe. If you long to
          reconnect with your deeper self, other living beings, and the Earth,
          you must read this book.”<br />
          —Carolyn Baker, PhD, co-author with Andrew Harvey of
          <i>Return to Joy</i> and author of
          <i
            >Love in the Age of Ecological Apocalypse: Cultivating the
            Relationships We Need to Thrive<br /></i
          ><br />
          “When Philip Shepherd asked me to look at his new manuscript, I was
          unprepared for the extraordinary experience that awaited me—within
          minutes I literally couldn’t put his book down.
          <i>Radical Wholeness</i> was not just talking about, but was literally
          speaking to—and invoking—a deeper, more whole and healed part of
          myself. While I was reading, I had the overwhelming feeling that it is
          as if this book is a multi-vitamin and mineral supplement—real
          medicine—secreted by the universe itself to help us heal our
          collective insanity. I can’t recommend <i>Radical Wholeness</i> highly
          enough.”<br />
          —Paul Levy, author of
          <i>Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Philip&nbsp; Shepherd is a force of nature. Fully embodied and
          present in the world, he stands&nbsp; outside the most fundamental
          bias of Western culture and offers us nothing less than a new center
          to live from. In his hands, wholeness is no longer just an idea or a
          goal to strive for; it becomes a visceral experience, and one that can
          be accessed at will through brilliantly simple practices. Here
          you&nbsp; will find both the vision and the means to come home to your
          own wholeness. This luminous&nbsp; book is clearly a lifework. Don’t
          miss it. It will transform you.”<br />
          —Morgan Farley, PhD., author of <i>Name Yourself Feast</i><br />
          “As a social ecologist I highly recommend this book as a valuable
          guide to a new way of being whole in our fragmented world.”<br />
          —Ben-Zion Weiss, PhD, author of
          <i>The Creativity&nbsp; Revolution: Steps to an Ecology of Culture</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In <i>Radical Wholeness,</i> Shepherd has given us an insight into
          what it really means&nbsp; to be human, and&nbsp; it could very well
          challenge our fundamental assumptions around this.
          <i>Radical Wholeness</i> is a profoundly personal message with&nbsp;
          truly global ramifications, written at a time of great need.”<br />
          —Michael Anderson, CEO Mediaworks NZ<br /><br />
          <i>“Radical Wholeness</i> is a profound, ground-opening, stunning
          book—a true masterpiece. Shepherd illuminates the madness of our
          western culture and entices the reader to drop into the wholeness that
          is always here with a powerful/urgent/gentle invitation to live from
          it. The radical wholeness that Shepherd embodies, in my experience, is
          the goal of all therapy and spiritual practice. This is one of the
          most profound books I have read in twenty-five years of practice and I
          will be recommending it to all my peers and clients.<br />
          —Natalie Lascelles, Psychotherapist and mindfulness coach<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This wonderful book written with tremendous clarity and profound
          wisdom should be in the library or backpack of every spiritual seeker.
          Its advice on embodiment is the best around and the practices Shepherd
          has evolved are matchlessly effective.”<br />
          —Andrew Harvey, author <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i
          ><br />
          “This is the best book I have read on embodiment, I cannot&nbsp;
          recommend it highly enough.”<br />
          —Jill Angelo, author
          <i>Sacred Space: Turning&nbsp; Your Home into a Sanctuary</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Philip&nbsp; Shepherd shakes up our way of looking&nbsp; at ourselves
          and the world.&nbsp; He challenges&nbsp; the way we were taught&nbsp;
          to think,&nbsp; and offers&nbsp; us&nbsp; something&nbsp; that&nbsp;
          could&nbsp; radically&nbsp; change&nbsp; how&nbsp; we&nbsp; live.
          Reading <i>Radical Wholeness</i> offers us real hope, the kind of hope
          that&nbsp; sees a way out of the quagmire&nbsp; of living in a
          unsustainable way in our own lives and our shared&nbsp; world.&nbsp;
          If there was ever a time for this book—this is it! Read it. Breathe it
          in. Let it change how you see and live and love your life and the
          world.”<br />
          —Oriah “Mountain Dreamer” House, author of <i>The Invitation</i>
