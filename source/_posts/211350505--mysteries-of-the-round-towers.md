          • Reveals how the round towers were built over the crossing of
          underground waterways and with every stone in magnetic polarity
          alignment<br /><br />• Explains how the siting and magnetic properties
          of the towers energetically enhances the surrounding environment, akin
          to <i>feng shui</i> and <i>vastu<br /></i><br />• Presents a guide to
          the energetic principles behind the creation and purpose of the round
          towers<br /><br />In Ireland, and to a lesser extent Scotland, in
          seemingly unconnected locations, there can be found more than 60
          enigmatic round towers, often over 30 meters tall and nearly uniform
          in their construction. Believed to have been built between the 7th and
          10th centuries CE, the Roman Catholic Church long ago laid claim to
          them. Yet who built them—and why—is completely unknown, and even their
          date of construction is debatable.<br /><br />Presenting a
          professional dowser’s radiesthetic and magnetic analysis of the round
          towers of Ireland, Christopher Freeland examines two previously
          unexplored yet fundamental facts common to all of the round towers:
          that they are built over the crossing of underground waterways and
          that every stone of each tower is laid with its negative magnetic
          polarity pointing upward. Explaining the basics of radiesthesia, the
          energetic science of dowsing, the author shows how siting the towers
          above underground water crossings has far-reaching ramifications for
          the health and well-being of humans, animals, and plants in the
          surrounding area and aligns with the energy-harmonizing practices of
          <i>feng shui</i> and <i>vastu</i>. He reveals how the systematic
          magnetic orientation of the stones used in the construction of each
          tower’s double walls results in the phenomenon of low-field magnetism,
          which, along with the towers’ precise placement, allows them access to
          the Earth’s telluric forces and further enhances their energetic
          effects on the surrounding environment. Investigating previous
          research on the round towers, the author explores the types of stone
          used, speculates on how many towers once existed, and firmly debunks
          the assertion that they were built by the Church.<br /><br />Concluding
          with a guide to the energetic principles behind the creation and
          purpose of the round towers, Freeland shows that we can once again
          embrace the ancient wisdom of our ancestors about the flow of energy
          in the Earth and bring back balance and harmony through understanding
          Nature’s alchemy of stone, water, and magnetism.
