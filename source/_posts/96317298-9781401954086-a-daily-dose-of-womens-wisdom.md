            For decades, <b>Christiane Northrup</b> has been helping women
            navigate their lives with grace and joy. This elegant, compact
            volume offers her trademark wisdom in a fresh form, filled with
            pointed reminders “to help you develop a deeper respect for, and
            connection to, your own body and its exquisite guidance system [to]
            create a vibrantly healthy body, mind, and spirit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Each beautifully designed black-and-white page carries a quote that
            touches on a topic of deep significance: everything from
            heart-listening to epigenetics to the importance of knowing that
            your decisions about medical treatment are not irreversible.
            Examples include:
          </p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;<i
            >You are an ever-renewing, ever-changing, ever-growing being, born
            with an inner guidance that helps you create and maintain vibrant
            health and happiness.</i
          >
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;<i
            >When faced with a dilemma, take a moment to sit with the issue.
            Don’t rush to decide what to do.</i
          >
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;<i
            >Intend to let Divine inspiration flow to you, and it will be so!</i
          >
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;<i
            >The next time you get an ache or a pain, soften the area around it
            with compassion.</i
          >
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;<i
            >Ask your body what it needs. Listen deeply for the answer.</i

        </h4>
        <p>
          Christiane Northrup, M.D., board-certified ob/gyn, former assistant
          clinical professor of ob/gyn at the University of Vermont College of
          Medicine, New York Times best-selling author, is a visionary pioneer
          in women’s health. After decades on the front lines of her profession
          as a practicing physician in obstetrics and gynecology, she is now
          dedicating her life to helping women truly flourish by learning how to
          enhance all that can go right with their bodies. Dr. Northrup is a
          leading proponent of medicine that acknowledges the unity of mind,
          body, emotions, and spirit. Internationally known for her empowering
          approach to women’s health and wellness, she teaches women (and many
          men) how to thrive at every stage of life and encourages them to
          create health on all levels by tuning in to their inner wisdom. As a
          business owner, physician, former surgeon, mother, writer, and
          speaker, Dr. Northrup acknowledges our individual and collective
          capacity for growth, freedom, joy, and balance. She is also thrilled
          with her company, Amata, whose name is derived from the Thai words for
          "ageless" and "eternal." This company is devoted to creating and
          distributing products that contribute to vibrant health and well-being
          throughout the life cycle (www.amatalife.com). When she’s not
          traveling, Dr. Northrup loves devoting her leisure time to dancing
          Argentine tango, staying fit through Pilates and resistance
          stretching, going to the movies, getting together with friends and
          family, potluck dinners, boating, process painting, and reading. Dr.
          Northrup stays in touch with her worldwide community through her
          Internet radio show, Flourish!, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, her
          e-letter, and her website, www.drnorthrup.com.
