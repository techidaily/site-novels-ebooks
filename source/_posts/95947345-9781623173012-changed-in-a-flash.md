            >This fascinating account and analysis of how one woman’s near-death
            experience sparked an awakening into psychic consciousness will

            (Bruce Greyson, MD, University of Virginia School of Medicine).</b

          <b></b><br />
          When Elizabeth Greenfield Krohn got out of her car with her two young
          sons in the parking lot of her synagogue on a late afternoon in
          September 1988, she couldn't have anticipated she would within seconds
          be struck by lightning and have a near-death experience. She felt
          herself transported to a garden and engaging in a revelatory
          conversation with a spiritual being. When she recovered, her most
          fundamental understandings of what the world is and how it works had
          been completely transformed. She was “changed in a flash,” suddenly
          able to interact with those who had died and have prescient dreams
          predicting news events. She came to believe that some early traumatic
          and abusive experiences had played a part in preparing her for this
          experience.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Told in matter-of-fact language, the first half of this book is the
          story of Krohn’s journey, and the second is an interpretation and
          analysis by respected professor of religion Jeffrey J. Kripal. He
          places Krohn’s experience in the context of religious traditions and
          proposes the groundbreaking idea that we are shaping our own
          experiences in the future by how we engage with near-death experiences
          in the present. <i>Changed in a Flash</i> is not about proving a
          story, but about carving out space for serious discussion of this
          phenomenon.

          <i>“Changed in a Flash</i> is a captivating collaboration between a
          remarkable woman who survived a lightning strike, only to discover
          inexplicable new—but not always welcomed—abilities and insights, and
          an acclaimed scholar of religious studies. Elizabeth Krohn’s
          spellbinding account of her experience and its striking after effects
          will astound you, and Jeffrey Kripal’s examination of their
          potentially revolutionary implications will inspire you to rethink how
          you understand humanity, death, and an afterlife.”<br />
          —Bruce Greyson, MD, Carlson Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry &amp;
          Neurobehavioral Sciences, Division of Perceptual Studies, University
          of Virginia School of Medicine<br /><br />“Near-Death Experiences are
          often recalled as shockingly vivid events with unexpected
          consequences, including newfound psychic abilities. Such a case is
          covered in the first part of the book. But it’s the second part that
          explores how to interpret the&nbsp;<i>meaning&nbsp;</i>of NDEs. Are
          they literally true reports of the afterlife, or hallucinatory dreams
          of a dying brain, or something much stranger?&nbsp;<i
            >Changed in a Flash&nbsp;</i
          >explores each of these interpretations, and it ends with a stunning
          conclusion. A thoughtful, fresh look at NDEs that threatens to exceed
          your boggle threshold. Highly recommended.”<br />
