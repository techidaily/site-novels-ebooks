            exercises in two minutes (or less!) to meet and communicate with
            your ancestral guides.</b
          ><br /><br />Discover how easy it is to ignite your intuition and
          connect with the other side!
          <i>Answers from the Ancestral Realms </i>will reveal the command
          words, visual images, and symbols that make ancestral communication
          fast and effortless. You'll realize that your ancestors are here with
          you, and you’ll open to their help and guidance every day.<br /><br />Meet
          ancestors far beyond your family and the "landcestors" from the
          cultures and geographical regions of your earliest roots. The word
          <i>ancestor</i> means "those who have gone before," so you can connect
          with spirits from the groups, organizations, activities, and projects
          in which you are engaged, such as authors, musicians, Freemasons,
          nurses, and so many more. You'll learn how to perceive their presence
          and receive their messages so clearly that their assistance will be
          available to you anytime, anywhere, and in every endeavor of your
          life—your work, relationships, ancestral healing, creative projects,
          and even psychic development.<br /><br />So, get ready to meet all
          your different ancestors. . . . They're already right next to you, and
          they're waiting for your call!
