            >From one of America’s top meditation teachers and mindfulness
            experts comes a revolutionarily simple approach to everyday
            practice—especially if you don’t think you have the time or the
            patience.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Imagine you’re sitting on a cushion with your legs crossed, ready to
          tap into unlimited joy. There’s just one problem: You can’t get
          comfortable (let alone still), and your head is full of way too many
          thoughts.<br /><br />
          The problem is not with meditation, or you, though—the issue may be
          with your approach.<br /><br />
          When properly understood and practiced, meditation should feel easy,
          calming, and comfortable. In <i>Bliss More, </i>maverick instructor
          Light Watkins provides the tools for making it E.A.S.Y. (Embrace,
          Accept, Surrender, Yield), dispels the biggest myths and
          misunderstandings, and shares real-world tips and straight talk for
          hacking into this ancient practice. The result: a happier and
          healthier you, inside and out. Watkins also shares candid testimonials
          from people whose lives have been enriched through his method, and
          extensive resources for transforming a daily chore into an enjoyable
          activity. Even the biggest skeptic will look forward to sitting for
          meditation every day.<br /><br />
          Whether you’re a novice or experienced practitioner,
          <i>Bliss More</i> will shed light on the path to a clearer mind,
          better sleep, and more bliss in everyday life.<br /><br /><b
