            We are all on a journey, a journey from illusion to truth.
            Self-Awareness and Meditation: An Advanced Guide for Meditators
            looks at both the evolution of consciousness along this journey, and
            meditation as an integral part of it. A point comes when there is an
            awakening to the possibility that there is more than the consensus
            reality, which we have been part of for eons. We know that there is
            something more -&nbsp;and so our search begins. Eventually, with
            meditation, our focus moves within as we search for the Self
            -&nbsp;our true nature -&nbsp;which, until now, has been hidden in
            illusion, waiting for our awakening and eventual, joyful return.
            Self-Awareness and Meditation&nbsp;focuses on the return journey
            back to the Self. True meditation is a state of awareness which
            comes naturally as we increasingly align with our soul. We realise
            that we are not the doer, and then comes a different perspective
            about allowing our false reality to fall away, and we discover that
            consciousness, not the ego, has been running the show all the time.

          A Guide for Advanced Meditators is an in-depth, accurate guide for
          anyone who practices meditation, especially in the West where
          traditional terminology is confusing. Charles Attfield has done the
          hard work of presenting Eastern Meditation wisdom in a form easily
          understood by the West, in the tradition of his teacher and founder of
          Synchronicity Foundation, Master Charles Cannon.

        <p>
          Charles Attfield was a high school teacher for most of his career.
          Originally from the UK, he moved to Australia in 1986. His interest in
          meditation and eastern philosophy grew rapidly after his later visits
          to India. In addition to teaching qualifications, Charles has
          qualifications in esoteric psychology, astrology and counselling. He
          lives in Helena Valley, Australia.
