          A famous English theoretical physicist passed away in March 2018.
          Three weeks later, his spirit appeared before Ryuho Okawa, the world’s
          most advanced psychic in Japan. A Brief History of a Physicist’s Soul
          is a record of the spiritual interview session with the spirit. Why
          did the scientist, who had been doing research on the universe, come
          to a religious master? What did he talk about after experiencing “a
          new universe” called the Spirit World following his passing? He did
          not fully believe in Heaven or the afterlife when he was alive, but
          did he change his belief? What did he say as he reflected back on his
          life of struggle with a difficult illness? This book contains
          extremely shocking, yet interesting content—a researcher who was at
          the cutting-edge of physics talks about his life after death. Read the
          pages, and you will know that religion and science are not meant to be
          against each other. <br /><br /><br /><br />For over 30 years, Ryuho
          Okawa has been conducting spiritual interviews with the spirits of
          great figures and well-known people who had passed away. Not only
          that; he has also conducted such interviews with the guardian spirits,
          or hidden consciousnesses, of living people. Some of these spirits
          include Princess Diana, Mother Teresa, Muhammad, Jesus Christ and the
          guardian spirit of Donald Trump. The purpose of conducting spiritual
          interviews is to prove the existence of the soul, the Spirit World,
          reincarnation and guardian spirits, and to enlighten people of the
          truth and diversity of the Spirit World. Okawa has published more than
          450 books of the spiritual interview series. The number and content of
          these books prove that spiritual messages are not fiction, but rather
          a real spiritual phenomenon. <br /><br /><br /><br />Quite a few
          Christians and materialists view spiritual messages as a heresy or
          doubt the credibility of the messages right from the start. It should
          be noted, however, that denying the newly revealed Truths, based on
          old religious knowledge and existing academic knowledge, is a mistake
          like what the churches did to Galileo—they denied heliocentric theory.
          Can your intellect honestly accept this spiritual Copernican
          Revolution in the modern age? Read Okawa’s spiritual interview series
          and find out…

          workshops Happy Science offers are open to people of all faiths and
