          A complete, illustrated guide to the ancient tradition of reading the
          face to gain insight into health, personality, relationships, and
          career <br /><br />• Details how to read the profile, front face,
          features, and musculature of the face to reveal temperament,
          personality traits, health predispositions, and mental state
          <br /><br />• Explores the history and development of face morphology
          from its origins in Israel and Egypt more than 4,500 years ago to its
          modern use in French medical schools <br /><br />• Examines the
          Foursquare diagram, developed by French occultist Papus, for highly
          accurate and detailed facial readings <br /><br />The face is a unique
          reflection of our genetic, inherited inclinations as well as the
          effects that life, nature, and relationships have had upon us. By
          looking at a person’s face, you can gain valuable insight into their
          personality, health, and how they navigate in the world.
          <br /><br />In this illustrated guide, Jennifer Lamonica reveals the
          sacred tradition of face morphology, an esoteric system that has been
          passed quietly from rabbi to student as an unbroken oral tradition for
          more than 4,500 years. She explores the history and development of
          this ancient art from its origins in Israel and Egypt to its use as
          the major diagnostic system in Europe until the Enlightenment and its
          current applications in French medical schools. Sharing the techniques
          of master face readers, the author details how to read the angles of
          the profile, as well as palm color and nose shape, to determine a
          person’s temperament, providing health and career insight into each of
          the four temperaments, including nutritional needs, digestive issues,
          sleep patterns, health predispositions, and ideal occupational paths.
          Exploring the Foursquare diagram, developed by French occultist Papus,
          for highly accurate and detailed facial readings, she explains how to
          read the front face in combination with planetary shapes, which reveal
          a person’s character; the major facial features, such as eyebrows,
          which reveal personal inclinations; and the musculature of the face,
          including expressions, which reveals a person’s current mental state.
          Providing case studies, she examines how to apply face morphology in
          relationships and in parenting. <br /><br />Exploring the meaning of
          each facial variation, while also honoring the intuitive impression
          received at first glance, Lamonica reveals how the ancient science of
          face reading allows you to compassionately help your loved ones,
          students, or clients, as well as overcome personal obstacles and
          better know yourself.
