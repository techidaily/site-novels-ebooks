            <i>The secret to a good life is not what you think.</i><br /><br />
            Most of us have been raised to believe that we can solve any problem
            if we think about it hard enough. We spend years honing our
            intellect, knowing that our brains are our best line of defense
            against whatever roadblocks life throws us. But each and every one
            of us has a secret weapon to call upon when brainpower isn’t enough,
            and that is Heart. <br /><br />Amy Bloch discovered the power of
            heart quite by accident. An accomplished psychiatrist, fully in
            control of her professional and family life, Amy was dealt what she
            thought was a devastating, insurmountable set-back when her daughter
            Emily was born with a severe brain malformation. Amy tried
            desperately to “fix” Emily, and exhausted herself in her efforts to
            deal with the “problem” using her intellect, going at it
            brain-first—the default way we tend to approach challenges in our
            society. Emily, on the other hand, lives completely heart-first: she
            simply doesn’t have the capabilities to approach life brain-first.
            Yet to Amy’s initial surprise—and ultimately, to her great
            admiration—Emily is remarkably happy and successful. <br />
            <i
              ><br />
              The Power of Heart</i
            >
            is the distillation of what Emily taught Amy—lessons that are
            applicable to anyone’s life. Learning to be Emily’s mom and
            observing how Emily approaches life prompted a radical change in
            Amy’s life. It also transformed her work with patients in her
            professional practice, where she witnessed over and over again how
            getting out of brain and into heart made life deeper and richer,
            less stressful, and more meaningful. While the brain is amazing,
            powerful, and useful, it does come with limitations. There’s some
            stuff the brain just doesn’t know, which is where heart comes in.
            Tapping into heart helps your brain perform better, and makes you
            stronger and smarter than you will ever be trusting only your brain.
            Heart will allow you to live with uncertainty; find strength,
            resilience, courage, and persistence in tough times; cast off
            self-criticism and doubt, and have a lot more confidence and fun.
            <i>The Power of Heart</i> is for readers of all ages and walks of
            life who are ready to move beyond the brain-first strategy, and
            embrace heart as well.

          "Every day we make important choices and vital decisions relying on
          our overtired and distracted brains. Amy Bloch’s beautiful, inspiring
          and wise book, <i>The Power of Heart</i>, is the gift of grace we all
          need to remind us that our true source of wisdom is only a heartbeat
          away."—Sarah Ban Breathnach, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author of <i>Simple Abundance</i> and
          <i>Something More<br /><br /></i>"<i>The Power of Heart</i> isn’t the
          sort of book one might expect a doctor to write. Based on her
          experience with a perfect daughter who happens to have an atypical
          brain, Amy Bloch has written a gently perceptive guide to releasing
          the mind’s death-grip on intellect and replacing it with a wiser,
          deeper way of knowing. In these pages, Bloch shows us a hundred simple
          paths from suffering and stress into peace and happiness."—Martha
