            >A practical guide to using diet and nutrition strategically to heal
            Hashimoto's thyroiditis.</b
          ><br /><br />If you've been diagnosed with Hashimoto's, it can be hard
          to know where to start with your diet. There are so many different
          cookbooks and recommendations, and few provide different options for
          different situations. That's where The Hashimoto's Healing Diet comes
          in!<br />In this book, Marc Ryan, L.Ac., will help you deal with the
          changes that are frequently involved with chronic conditions like
          Hashimoto's. He shows you how to use dietary inventions strategically,
          so that you can adapt your plan in different circumstances. He'll
          guide you through the various complications associated with
          Hashimoto's, and the recommended diet and treatment protocols for each
          one, including Candida, histamine intolerance, intestinal problems,
          Epstein-Barr virus, and more. <br />In much the same way Marc explored
          the five elements of thyroid health in his first book, How to Heal
          Hashimoto's, he will explore the five elements of digestive health
          here (earth, metal, wood, water, and fire). You'll learn a brief
          history of Chinese medicine and "yin fire," one of the most important
          concepts in internal diseases. <br />Finally, Marc offers an action
          plan for readers to continue on their journey toward total wellness.

          “<i>The Hashimoto’s Healing Diet</i>&nbsp;should be in the tool kit of
          anyone looking to go beyond the autoimmune protocol and learn how to
          layer the dietary principles from Chinese medicine into their wellness
          journey. If you are looking for deeper self-assessment and
          troubleshooting, this book is for you.”<br /><b>— Mickey Trescott</b>,
          certified nutritional therapy practitioner, author of&nbsp;<i
            >The Autoimmune Paleo Cookbook</i
          >, and co-author of&nbsp;<i>The Autoimmune Wellness Handbook</i
          ><br /><br />“This is the comprehensive book to heal Hashimoto’s that
          we have all been waiting for. What sets Marc apart from the numerous
          books on thyroid diet and health is that Marc is an experi-enced
          practitioner who has years of clinical experience to guide his
          suggestions, inspirations, and expertise. He opens up the much needed
          dialogue between the gut microbiome and immune system that is missing
          in most autoimmune healing conversations. This is the book I will be
          recommending to all my clients.”<br /><b>— Jessica Flanigan</b>,
          clinical nutritionist and author of&nbsp;<i>AIP One Dish</i
          >&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Loving Diet</i><br /><br />“Marc is a masterful
          storyteller. He eloquently weaves the concepts of Chinese medicine
          into an innovative approach to treating autoimmune diseases that every
          patient (and every doctor) needs to know. His ‘Food as Medicine’
          excerpts were powerful—chrysanthemum flower tea for headaches,
          watermelon tea for edema, and aloe for constipation. Answers for
          common and oh so stubborn Hashimoto’s symptoms, finally!”<br /><b
            >— Dana Trentini</b
          >, founder of Hypothyroid Mom and co-author of&nbsp;<i
            >Your Healthy Pregnancy with Thyroid Disease</i
          ><br /><br />“This is it! This is what the millions of people
          challenged with Hashimoto’s have been searching for.&nbsp;<i
            >The Hashimoto’s Healing Diet&nbsp;</i
          >is a blueprint for healing through proven nutritional strategies.
          Marc combines ancient wisdom with practical dietary interventions to
          help you heal for good. Do yourself and your thyroid gland a huge
          favor by following Marc’s guidelines. Your road to recovery starts at
          your next meal.”&nbsp;<br /><b>— Sachin Patel</b>, founder of The
          Living Proof Institute and functional medicine practitioner
          coach&nbsp;<br /><br />“A delightful read full of important
          informational gems for those of us moving through the sometimes
          complicated journey that is Hashimoto’s. The information is presented
          in an easy-to-follow format, especially for those of us dealing with
          brain fog. Marc weaves meaningful and relatable case studies
          (appropriately called ‘Hashimoments’) throughout the book, allow-ing
          the reader to feel validated, heard, and supported. A rare treat, not
          to be missed!”&nbsp;<br /><b>— Danna Bowman</b>, founder of Thyroid
          Nation, host of&nbsp;<i>Thyroid Nation Radio</i>, and co-founder of
          Thyroid Refresh™ and Thyroid30™&nbsp;<br /><br />“This is not your
          average book about diet, but much, much more. Marc has a unique
          ability to communicate complex subjects in a non-threatening, even
          entertaining way—which weaves together modern, cutting-edge scientific
          research with Traditional Chinese Medicine in a way I’ve not seen done
          before. A very refreshing perspective for those interested in the
          inner-workings of autoimmunity and other immune-related conditions. I
          highly recommend this book for anyone looking to take control of their
          own personal health, and have fun while doing it!”<br /><b
            >— Michael Roesslein, M.Sc.</b
          >, co-founder of Rebel Health Tribe and producer of The Human
          Longevity Project<br /><br />“Marc has always proven himself to be an
          ardent student and practitioner of functional medicine. In a friendly
          and even comforting tone, he leads the Hashimoto’s reader through
          cutting-edge foundations to improving health and well-being. What
          really sets his book apart, however, is his ability to integrate
          Traditional Chinese Medicine with modern functional medicine. You’ll
          find Chinese herbal remedies for common Hashimoto’s related issues and
          explanations of symptoms through Chinese medicine’s use of elements
          and nature. The result is an uncanny insight into the holism of
          Chinese medicine that works together with our modern, scientific
          understandings of thyroid autoimmunity.”<br /><b
            >— Datis Kharrazian, D.H.Sc., D.C., F.A.C.N, C.N.S.<br /></b
          ><br />“Marc Ryan does Hashimoto’s patients a great service in weaving
          the powerful tenets of Traditional Chinese Medicine with humor,
          candor, and a highly digestible writing style. His message speaks to
          the interconnectedness of our bodily and planetary systems, while at
          the same time honoring the dynamic nature of true well-being. As
          patterns of deficiency and/or excess ebb and flow in our bodies, what
          we give them should follow suit. This may be the most evolved approach
          to ‘food as medicine’ that I’ve encountered—and the most ancient.”<br /><b
