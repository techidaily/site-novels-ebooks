          After literally stumbling into orbs appearing as bright as light bulbs
          in photographs he was taking at a spiritual retreat, Dr. Klaus
          Heinemann immediately sensed that he was onto something profound.
          There was no choice but to convince himself that his notion was on
          solid grounds. Heinemann looked at thousands of pictures he had taken
          earlier, and thousands more would be taken to test the hypothesis that
          these light circles are nothing less than emanations from Spirit
          beings. <br />
          <br />
          Dr. Míceál Ledwith had a similar experience after the orb phenomenon
          was first made known to him through the teachings of Ramtha. He began
          an intense and systematic study of orbs in all sort of situations, day
          and night, and in all sorts of atmospheric conditions, in order to
          discover all he could about their nature, the situations in which
          their presence could be most easily detected, and what implications
          they might have for our understanding of our own place in the cosmos.
          To date, he has amassed a collection of well over 100,000 images.
          <br />
          <br />
          In <i>The Orb Project</i>, Ledwith and Heinemann present their
          fascinating discoveries, along with practical tips that amateur
          digital photographers can use to photograph orbs and properly
          distinguish them from "false" orbs that are really dust or water
          particles. They offer guidelines on deciphering the orbs' various
          patterns, features, and characteristics, based on their extensive
          research. <br />
          <br />
          As Dr. Ledwith points out, once you develop a keen and sustained
          interest in photographing spirit entities, some quite interesting
          things begin to happen: the brain stops censoring these images, and
          you can begin to see with orbs with the naked eye -- in more color and
          detail than is visible to even a digital camera. <br />
          <br />
          Ledwith and Heinemann also explore communication with orbs and what
          their existence means to our lives. The implications of a realization
          that we are "surrounded by a cloud of witnesses" are enormous and
          incredibly hopeful for the world at large.

          Klaus Heinemann, PhD, was born and educated in Germany. He holds a PhD
          in experimental physics from the University of Tumbingen. Dr.
          Heinemann worked for many years in materials science research at NASA,
          UCLA, and as a research professor at Stanford University. He is
          founder and chairman of a corporation that performs scientific
          research in computational fluid dynamics, materials development, and
          nanotechnology under contracts from NASA. For several decades, Dr.
          Heinemann has worked on mending the commonly perceived rift between
          science and spirituality and lectures on expanding perception.<br /><br />Miceal
          Ledwith, PhD, was Professor of Systematic Theology for sixteen years
          at Maynooth College in Ireland and subsequently served for ten years
          as president of the university.<br /><br />He was a member of the
          International Theological Commission, a small group of theologians of
          international standing, charged with advising the Holy See on
          theological matters. He also served as Chairman of the Committee of
          Heads of the Irish Universities and as a member of the governing
          Bureau of the Conference of European University Presidents (CRE).<br /><br />He
          has lectured extensively throughout Europe, South Africa, Japan,
          Australia, Mexico, and North America. His forthcoming books are
