          ><br /><br />John Lerma’s bestselling book, <i>Into the Light</i>,
          inspired thousands of readers to discover not only what awaits us as
          we prepare to make our journey from earth to heaven, but, more
          importantly, how to achieve heaven on earth. Now in
          <i>Learning from the Light</i>, Dr. Lerma shares more angelic messages
          given to his patients and more stories from and about survivors who
          have experienced the loss of a loved one&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
          their visits with angels.<br /><br />The mystical experiences
          described in this revelatory work include:Messages about the future of
