            Cynthia Spring and Frances Vaughan are engaged in a dialogue based
            on seven questions about life after life. This fascinating book --
            an anchor during a chaotic time filled with confusion and suffering
            -- offers a larger frame, a greater reality. The authors, one
            incarnate, one discarnate, address the fears we all are experiencing
            as we watch our world crumbling. Countries are collapsing; religious
            and political institutions are wobbling. In this the time of
            rebalance, we are learning the hard way that change is the only
            constant. Knowledge of life after life helps us let go of the primal
            fear of death itself. Frances Vaughan’s vantage point “from the
            balcony” offers us a more expansive way of seeing our world. This
            book encourages direct experience over belief, and provides portals
            for exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seven Questions also moves us toward a greater sense of
            consciousness, of love, of the value of our own evolution. Frances
            describes the dimension she is in – earth-like, filled with Love and
            Light, and surprisingly integrated with our own space/time
            dimension. We can make the transition more peacefully, knowing that
            we will reunite with loved ones who have gone before us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way to deal with the “upcoming upheavals,” as Frances calls
            them, is to be of service in whatever ways we can, unique to our own
            evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frances: “Let me just say that the experience of this side fills me
            with a joy beyond comprehension. The important point for us to
            convey right now is that the reality of life in another dimension is
            what awaits all of us. If you can accept that as a guiding
            principle, then you will live your life according to higher values,
            no matter what is going on around you.”

          “This is a message of great importance — to those who fear death, and
          those of us who struggle with the pain and aloneness of this planet.
          Frances Vaughn tells us what we most need to know — that love is what
          connects us to each other and to All, and love is what we come here to
          learn. This is a book to set your course by, to use as a touch-stone,
          and give you peace as you transition to the greater reality. Beautiful
          and life-saving.” --Matthew McKay, Ph.D. Author of Seeking Jordan: How
          I Learned About Death and The Invisible Universe
        </p>

          “I feel that Seven Questions will be a valuable contribution to the
          ‘life after life’ field. It is fairly short, easy to read, practical,
          reassuring, and written from the heart. This book arises from a deep
          and enduring friendship which continues whether or not the individuals
          are physically or nonphysically focused. I will undoubtedly be loaning
          this book to those who can be uplifted by it.” --Ellen Jones-Walker,
          Monroe Institute Residential Trainer
        </p>
        <p>
          “WOW! This writing/channeling will touch so many who are seeking to
          know that their loved ones remain close at hand and continue to
          communicate with us even after death. Seven Questions will open a lot
          of doors and windows for those who are ready to feel the wind of
          possibilities blowing in.” --Regina Ochoa, medium who works with the
          Foundation for Mind-Being Research in Los Altos, CA
        </p>
        <p>
          “Seven Questions About Life after Life is an accessible, vibrant, and
          fascinating look at what consciousness is. The wisdom of the channeled
          information from Frances calls for several re-readings and comes
          through with intensity, poignancy, and recognition of truth.
          I&nbsp;strongly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to engage in
          a deep reflection into who we are and what we someday will become, and
          for those who ache to actively interact with these ideas.”--Lisa
          Smartt, author, Words at the Threshold, Veil, and Cante Bardo;
          Founder, The Final Words Project; Co-founder, The University of Heaven
