            >In the vein of&nbsp;<i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>, this powerful memoir
            chronicles a woman's search for meaning following a
            paradigm-shifting near-death experience</b
          ><br /><br />Karen Henson Jones was on the conventional path to
          success in the corporate world when a sudden cardiac event at the age
          of 30 took her to the brink of death. During an otherworldly
          near-death experience, she was presented with a choice to leave her
          body or to return to Earth. When her request to live was granted,
          Karen was forced to come to terms with the life she had been
          living.<br /><br />With warmth, wonder, and wit,&nbsp;<i
            >Heart of Miracles</i
          >&nbsp;follows Karen on an inspirational journey through India, Italy,
          Bhutan, and the Holy Land of Israel in search of a more meaningful
          life. Exploring the power of meditation, Western medical science, the
          transformative doctrines of reincarnation, and the teachings of Jesus,
          Karen encourages us to embrace the full possibilities of our spiritual
          selves.

          "This is a beautiful book. Karen is a very good teacher, and her
          experiences have motivated her to work on behalf of the lives of
          others."<br />— Khen Rinpoche, abbot of the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery (in
          exile), as appointed by His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama<br /><br />"I’m
          touched by how Karen heroically turns a painful near-death experience
          into a beautiful search for meaning, where she meets Jesus, St.
          Francis, and God. The book you hold in your hands can bring you peace,
          laughter, and a new way of looking at life."<br />— Chade-Meng Tan,
          Jolly Good Fellow of Google and best-selling author of Search Inside
          Yourself, and member of the One Billion Acts of Peace team nominated
          for the Nobel Peace Prize<br /><br />"It was either by chance or fate
          that I met Karen Henson Jones at a local coffee shop. I met an
          incredibly optimistic, spiritual woman, full of life.<br />"I would
          have never known that she endured many years of pain and experiences
          that would have left most lifeless, literally or metaphorically, but
          not Karen. Her optimism comes from her belief in something greater
          than ourselves. This book is an uplifting and inspiring chronicle of
          that journey."<br />— Ken Paves, humanitarian, beauty expert, and
          author of You Are Beautiful<br /><br />"In Heart of Miracles, Karen
          searches out the wisdom and lives the wisdom to put her mind, body,
          and spirit back together. By practicing the concepts of meditation,
          yoga, and nutrition, she finds serenity and calm out of chaos. She is
          a new, powerful voice for a community of change in the areas of health
          care, well-being, and spirituality."<br />— Donna Karan, designer and
          founder of the Urban Zen Foundation
