            We learn who we are through our relationships. Anyone who has had
            the privilege of being in the presence of an enlightened person or
            spiritual teacher will appreciate the power of such a learning
            experience. In Living With Enlightenment, Brad Laughlin recounts the
            story of his journey of love with Leslie Temple-Thurston, a
            world-renowned teacher of enlightenment. Brad and Leslie have lived
            and worked together for the past twenty-five years and share an
            intimacy and love that is deep, ancient and enduring. Their
            unconventional love story is at the heart of this book.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />Sometimes light and humorous and at other times sad and
            touchingly intimate, Living With Enlightenment is always profound.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />At this pivotal moment in human evolution, Brad’s message
            conceptualizes a necessary shift in consciousness as a move from
            separation (or duality) to heart-centered unity. He uses personal
            experiences and memories as a very grounded and practical way of
            illustrating timeless spiritual truths which are of relevance to us
            all. The collection of stories form a map, navigating a conscious
            path to realization of the Self.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the book is autobiographical in nature, it acknowledges
            that our memories—whether painful or pleasurable—are merely aspects
            of the egoic self. Ultimately, our life’s journey is about
            transcending the personal self and awakening the awareness of the
            vast, eternal Self.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most importantly this book is about living in truth and love. As
            humanity and our beautiful, fragile blue planet confront
            unprecedented challenges, our biggest teaching is to embrace the
            courage, insight and wisdom to<br />choose love.

          “This is an important, exciting and transformative book by one of our
          wisest mystics. It is the unconventional and profoundly moving story
          of a unique, soul love relationship. Read it and you will be deeply
          inspired, not only by Brad<br />Laughlin’s exquisite and naked prose
          but by the directly initiatory teachings of his great consort and
          illumined spiritual teacher, Leslie Temple-Thurston.”<br /><strong

        <p>
          In Living With Enlightenment, Brad Laughlin nakedly shares his
          transpersonal autobiography, shaped and illumined by his longtime
          partnership with Leslie Temple-Thurston. In it, we glimpse not only an
          extraordinary teacher-student relationship which becomes a romantic
          partnership, but are magnanimously invited to become spiritual
          warriors as well as spiritual midwives in the journey from
          ego-consciousness to embodied love in action. Refreshingly, amid a
          plethora of teachings on enlightenment as a final end-point, Brad
          Laughlin clarifies that, in his words, the journey of enlightenment is
          a never-ending continuum of spiritual evolution. Although there are
          milestones along the way, there is no fixed goal or endpoint because
          on this journey we are always learning, growing and becoming.
