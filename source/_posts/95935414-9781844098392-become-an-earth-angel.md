          In <i>Earth Angel: A Guide to Finding Your Wings</i>, Sonja Grace
          brings an entirely new perspective to the angel genre. She has been
          traveling and working in the angelic realm for over 30 years is
          dedicated to Divine love and is an Earth Angel. Our planet has moved
          into the fifth dimension and we are about to witness a new order of
          earth angels. Hundreds of thousands of people are beginning to feel a
          calling to their spiritual light. Yet, some feel misunderstood,
          different and in many cases extremely sensitive and intuitive about
          people and events. Sonja Grace was destined to write Earth Angel: A
          Guide to Finding Your Wings to assist those emerging souls who are
          searching for answers and hoping to discover their path of service and
          their spiritual connection to the divine. Through her own
          extraordinary case studies, Sonja Grace reveals what it is like to do
          the work of an earth angel and how she has used her gifts to locate
          missing people, conduct long distance healing and council a myriad of
          international clients. Readers are taken on a journey into the angelic
          realms. Sonja Grace offers fresh insight and descriptions along with
          explanations of the angels and the earth angel phenomenon; what they
          are, how to identify them, what they do, where they come from and
          their particular mission at this time in the earthâ€™s history.

          "What a blessed book this one is. 158 pages of pure Celestial wisdom
          right at your fingertips. The exciting feature of this glorious how-to
          is that it is aimed at those of us who are spirit based and here to
          help the world. I learned so much about ways we can help, why we help,
          and even how the realm system works.<br /><br />I feel so honored to
          help announce this great teacher to its seeking public because I know
          it is so needed. I would recommend this much awaited guide to anyone
          who feels they could use a little help in the waking up department.
          Thanks Sonja, you are truly amazing."
