          A groundbreaking exploration of how psychedelics and quantum science
          are vital to understanding the evolution of consciousness and reality
          <br /><br />• Explains why altered states of consciousness exist, how
          they work, and why psychedelics have the effects that they do
          <br /><br />• Describes how quantum waves, rather than the DNA
          molecule, have been the driving force behind biological and historical
          evolution <br /><br />• Explains how psychedelics interact with the
          human mind to create altered states that may further the continued
          evolution of consciousness <br /><br />In this groundbreaking book,
          Carl Johan Calleman reveals the quantum science of the Maya, a science
          lost to the modern world that explains the phenomenology of
          psychedelics and altered states of consciousness. The ancient Maya had
          a sophisticated understanding of the multidimensional nature of
          reality and the forces that drive the evolution of consciousness.
          Calleman explains how quantum waves, illustrated by the Mayan
          Calendar, emanate from the center of the universe and activate new
          phases in the evolution of consciousness through holographic
          resonance, which alters the dualities of the human mind. For example,
          the 5th Wave, which dominated in Paleolithic times and evolved human
          consciousness above that of animals, brought a chaotic floating state
          reminiscent of the psychedelic or shamanic state, and the recent 8th
          Wave brought the digital revolution. The 9th Wave, which began in
          2011, offers the potential for individual development of higher
          consciousness and healing if we can synchronize ourselves with its
          positive holograms. <br /><br />This multidimensional perspective
          explains why altered states of consciousness exist and how they work.
          Calleman describes the role of the pineal gland for the human mind,
          how it controls our state of consciousness and how it can connect us
          to the cosmic Tree of Life. He shows that the mind is a “reducing
          valve” that normally limits our experience of cosmic consciousness but
          that this can be reversed through altered states. As Calleman
          concludes, psychedelics like ayahuasca and DMT not only give rise to
          extraordinary mystical and cosmic experiences and enable access to
          healing states, but they also are important for harmoniously
          synchronizing humanity with the 9th Wave to further the evolution of
          consciousness.

          “Carl Johan Calleman has produced nothing less than a potential
          Copernican Revolution across the sciences with his seventh book,
          <i>Quantum Science of Psychedelics</i>. Trained in chemistry, Carl has
          an encyclopedic grasp of the broad spectrum of the sciences. Building
          upon his previous research and books, he essentially is proposing to
          replace the flawed neo-Darwinian paradigm of random chance mutations
          with a much more purposeful transformation of bodies and minds, as
          well as culture, through the interference patterns of Mayan
          macrocosmic quantum waves. Rather than producing consciousness, the
          brain acts as a ‘reducing valve,’ downloading consciousness and
          allowing for resonance with various quantum waves. Carl Johan Calleman
          is not some mere armchair scholar but is a true participant-observer
          into the realms of which he writes. From his research into the
          significance of the Preferred Axis in Cosmology to the central role of
          the pineal gland, from his careful analysis of the Mayan calendar
          system to his participation in ayahuasca ceremonies, Carl must be
          credited with forging a path into a new (yet very old and forgotten)
          way of viewing, explaining, and predicting the world. You cannot read
          this book without expanding your mind!”
