            >Tamar and Amnon. He saw. He came. He conquered. And he didn’t care
            that she would bear the brunt of his bad choices.</b
          >
          As a King’s son, nothing would be denied him, even though this
          particular experience should. Passion for him, became pain for an
          innocent woman. Unfortunately, that wasn’t the worst of sins in this
          scandal. The man who was supposed to love and protect her did nothing,
          forcing her brother to take deadly action that plunged the kingdom
          into chaos.<br /><br /><b>Broken.</b><br /><br />
          Naleighna Kai was adopted by her biological mother. Yes, you read that
          right. What’s more, is the horrific circumstances surrounding her
          conception meant her mother was forced to do the best she could to
          place Naleighna in the arms of someone who would love Her. Life had
          other plans; and the trauma of those childhood years would result in
          the need to heal in a miraculous way.<br /><br /><b>To Blessed.</b
          ><br /><br />People come into your life for many reasons. In this
          respect, several amazing men brought life lessons that affected the
          healing Naleighna craved. Then there is the tribe—a group of dynamic
          women and men, writing angels who show her how blessed and highly
          favored she is on a daily basis. Transformation tells of her trials,
          but also the triumphs.<br /><br /><b
            >ABOUT THE MERRY HEARTS INSPIRATIONAL SERIES</b
          ><br /><br />Some use God's word to justify domestic violence,
          imprisonment, slavery, and systematic racism rather than preach peace,
          joy, salvation, and love. Throughout the Merry Hearts Inspirational
          series, readers will experience scripture as never before. Authors
          take one-dimensional Biblical characters and breathe new life into
          them to become relevant for the reader. <br /><br />Over time, many
          things have been misinterpreted, but the one important thing is that
          God’s grace isn’t just for men. Christ valued women so much. He had
          His most profound conversations with women. Christ performed
          astounding miracles through them, and following His resurrection, He
          appeared to the women first.<br /><br />Throughout scripture, God's
          love for women and everyone—no matter ethnic background or gender—may
          be found, from Genesis to Revelation. May you come to know His love in
          an authentic, tangible way.<br /><br />Each book in the Merry Hearts
          Inspirational Series is a standalone and can be read in any order:<br /><br />Book
