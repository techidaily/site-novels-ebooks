            >Attune yourself to everyday Reiki with a revolutionary guide to an
            at-home practice.<br /><br />"This book will transform you. Brett
            Bevell teaches us how to shift every aspect of life, from the food
            and water we put into our bodies to the past, present, and
            future."—David Morehouse, PhD, author of&nbsp;<i
              >Psychic Warrior</i
            ></b
          ><br /><br />Reiki tradition dictates that you must be initiated—or
          attuned—by a Reiki master before properly practicing this healing art
          of energy flow. In this revolutionary guide, Reiki Master Brett Bevell
          breaks with convention and extends the transformative powers of Reiki
          to all by presenting at-home rituals for self-attunement. In the true
          healing spirit of Reiki, Bevell encourages creativity and
          experimentation with the practice, allowing you to personalize Reiki
          for everyday use. With twenty-one symbols to empower the flow of
          Reiki, as well as chants for attuning candles, stones, and even the
          water in your bath or washing machine, this is Reiki as you've never
          seen it before: available to everyone, for use in all aspects of life,
          as Reiki was always meant to be.

          "As a spiritual healer and a devoted Reiki lover I feel I have been
          waiting for this book my whole life. When I opened it and started
          seeing the extended symbols, and was able to see the different
          suggested exercises, I felt totally at home. The author has written a
          book that I believe to be divinely channeled and a must for this world
          and the people in it.&nbsp;Reiki is a wonderful energy that I feel
          belongs to all of us and I got pretty sad when I saw the rules and
          limitations that have been put on it over the years. I enjoyed the
          gentle loving flow of the great mentor and I was completely taken with
          the idea of attuning crystals, candles and other neat stuff. I would
          recommend this awesome teacher to anyone who has ever been drawn to
          Reiki I believe it holds a lot of the answers we have all been seeking
          and it has definitely made its way to my spiritual toolbox. Thanks so
          much Brett, for helping to return our birthright to us."<b
