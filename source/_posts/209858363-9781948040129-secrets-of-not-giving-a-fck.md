            Life isn’t always easy, unless of course you are an Instagram travel
            blogger who pretends it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once in a while, things happen, things you can’t always control such
            as rain on your wedding day or needing to take a shit during a
            2-hour job interview, but what if there was a way to train your mind
            to not give a f*ck?

            book is written with the intent of empowering you so that you can
            start to take control of your life and stop worrying about so many
            f*cks.

          instant gratification.You are content in weekly debates with family
          about how to change your life.You always say yes at work when really
          you should say no.Your idea of dealing with problems involves drinking

          dream or goal but feel hesitant about pursuing it.You want to organize

          there.You know somewhere within you lies a badass who won’t take no
