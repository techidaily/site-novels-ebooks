            Gary Lee Brown walks you through his incredible life journey from
            Brentwood, New York, to winning a football championship on the
            world's greatest sports stage. However, his greatest battles would
            not end on the football field. Locking horns with paralysis and
            depression after his career helped lead him down a path that not
            only saved his life but the lives of all those around him whom he
            serves now on a daily basis. Within these pages, you can learn about
            how he navigated through these deadly waters so that you can help
            yourself and others overcome life's many challenges.

            "This book will hit every NFL player's heart and soul. Gary nails
            it. This book really describes in detail the painful journey that a
            few NFL players go through."

            advantage of them at the right time. Most importantly it is not the
            transition to life in football but transition of life after
            football."

            faced as a youth, his path to the "glamourous" world of professional
            sports, and life after the NFL. He shares heartfelt experiences that
            shaped him along the way."
