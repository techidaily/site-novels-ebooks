          <p>
            Every personâ€™s individual conceptual reality is held in place by the
            subconscious, which exists on the periphery of our conscious
            experience. The conscious mind did not establish these conceptual
            constructions; they were gathered from experience by the
            subconscious and constructed to keep us safe.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />The ancient Greeks of the mystery schools called the result of
            this construction the meta-identity. That means it is the identity
            that comes after the original identity with which we were born. The
            construction starts as early as when we cry for our first food.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />The subconscious, using the physical dynamics and chemistry of
            the brain, constructs the world around us at every moment. Without
            this interface between the subconscious and the brain, the world
            might be a very confusing place.<br />According to the blueprint the
            subconscious has established, the conscious mind will view and react
            to the world from a particular and unique perspective. But no
            concept embedded in the subconscious is really a part of the self.
            Constructs only help us navigate the world in which we find
            ourselves. They are useful, and often necessary, but they are also
            disposable and replaceable with concepts that are more appropriate
            to our present circumstances and accumulated life knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />Since the subconscious is the author and keeper of the
            concepts that construct, and lead us to react to the world, it must
            also be the agent of change.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />The author provides simple methods to observe the subconscious
            construction and engage with the subconscious in ways that encourage
            not only greater insight into yourself, but also provide catalysts
            for the subconscious to change the fundamental concepts that may be
            limiting your success in the world and in your personal and business
            relationships. The techniques described trigger deeper understanding
            of yourself, and a greater insight into the hidden depths, joys and
            magic of the world in which you live.
