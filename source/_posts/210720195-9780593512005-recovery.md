            ><br /><br />A gentle, expert guide to the secrets of recovery,
            showing why we need it and how to do it better</b
          ><br /><br />For many of us, time spent in recovery—from a broken leg,
          a virus, chronic illness, or the crisis of depression or anxiety—can
          feel like an unwelcome obstacle on the road to health. Modern medicine
          too often assumes that once doctors have prescribed a course of
          treatment, healing takes care of itself. But recovery isn’t something
          that “just happens.” It is an act that we engage in and that has the
          potential to transform our lives, if only we can find ways to learn
          its rhythms and invest our time, energy, and participation.<br /><br />Drawing
          on thirty years of medicine, and on insights from practitioners,
          psychologists, and writers across history, physician Gavin Francis
          delivers a profound, practical, and deeply hopeful guide to recovery.
          Rejecting the idea that healing is passive, <i>Recovery</i> offers
          tools and wisdom for convalescence, and shows how tending to our
          bodies, environments, and perspectives can help us move through the
          landscape of illness—and come out the other side whole.

          "Healing can be maddeningly slow work, Gavin Francis recognizes, but
          it offers us the opportunity to live differently. Beyond the fantasy
          of the quick and easy cure is the reality of living with and through
          our physical limitations, which requires creativity.
          <i>Recovery</i> offers inspiration and advice for practicing this lost
          art. Throughout, Francis is alert to the political and economic forces
          that undermine our efforts."

          “We spend too much time thinking about illness and hardly enough
          thinking about recovery and recuperation. Gavin Francis’s literary
          talent combined with his years as a seasoned medical practitioner make
          <i>Recovery</i> a unique and delightful read.”
