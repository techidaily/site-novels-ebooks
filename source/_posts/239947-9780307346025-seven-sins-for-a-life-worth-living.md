          “Conventional wisdom,” says Roger Housden, “tells us that nobody goes
          to heaven for having a good time.”
          <i>Seven Sins for a Life Worth Living</i>, then, is a refreshing,
          liberating, and decidedly welcome dose of unconventional wisdom that
          awakens us to the simple delights and transformative joys of the world
          around us.<br /><br />With elegance, gentle humor, and remarkable
          openness, Housden takes us along as he recalls his personal journey
          toward an appreciation of what he calls the Seven Pleasures: The
          Pleasure of All Five Senses, The Pleasure of Being Foolish,The
          Pleasure of Not Knowing, The Pleasure of Not Being Perfect, The
          Pleasure of Doing Nothing Useful, The Pleasure of Being Ordinary, and
          The Pleasure of Coming Home.<br /><br />Housden writes, for instance,
          of submitting to the ultimate folly of falling in love, of celebrating
          our imperfections, of coming to understand the virtues of the Slow
          Food movement while enjoying an all-afternoon lunch in a small French
          village, and of discovering in a Saharan cave that, however
          extraordinary our surroundings, “we are human, a glorious nothing much
          to speak of”—and learning to be at peace with the notion.<br /><br />Such
          pleasures may be suspect in today’s achievement-driven, tightly
          scheduled, relent-lessly self-improving, conspicuously consumptive
          culture, but surely the greater sin lies in letting them slip away
          moment by precious moment. “The purpose of this book,” says Housden,
          “is to inspire you to lighten up and fall in love with the world and
          all that is in it.” Reading it is a pleasure indeed.<br /><br /><br />“When
          you die,God and the angels will hold you accountablefor all the
          pleasures you were allowed in life that you denied yourself.”<br /><br /><br />Roger
          Housden, author of the bestselling Ten Poems series, presents a
          joyously affirmative, warmly personal, and spiritually illuminating
          meditation on the virtues of opening ourselves up to pleasures like
          being foolish, not being perfect, and doing nothing useful, the
          pleasure of not knowing, and even (would you believe it?) the pleasure
          of being ordinary.

          "In <i>Seven Sins for a Life Worth Living </i>Housden presents
          erudite, witty essays on seven so-called “transgressions”—sensuality,
          foolishness, ignorance, imperfection, uselessness, ordinariness and
          prodigality. There are no case studies, success stories or how-to
          exercises in <i>Seven Sins</i>. Instead, we get the author’s personal
          reflections on modern life, sprinkled throughout with apt,
          wide-ranging references and quotes from philosophers and poets,
          scientists, political figures, artists and literary greats. This book
          is a subjective prescription for happiness, an utter delight, filled
          with Housden’s trademark self-deprecatory humor...Roger Housden wants
          you to consider sin in a whole new light—as a means toward
          enlightenment! This book is an utter delight, filled with Housden’s
          trademark self-deprecatory humor and slightly offbeat insight. You
          probably won’t see hell if you read this book, but you just might
          catch a glimpse of heaven.”—<i>BookPage<br /><br /></i>“A beautifully
          introspective book written by a keen observer of modern life.
          Housden's writing is pheromonal and provocative. It resembles the
          random musings of a self-professed dreamer. But lying within those
          ramblings is an elixir for life.” —Wendy Hoke,
          <i>Dallas Morning News</i>
