            >Your goal while inhabiting human form is to manifest love in this
            physical dimension. Yet, like many a courageous soul who has chosen
            to tackle this difficult task, you may need to be reminded to
            <i>activate</i> this innate force that dwells inside you.<br /></b
          ><br />In this fascinating book, internationally acclaimed medium
          <b>James Van Praagh</b> demonstrates that love knows no limits —it is
          the power that holds together everything. Through vivid examples of
          various everyday situations in life —and knowledge gleaned from the
          Other Side —James shows you the process for activating this power . .
          . and thereby fulfilling your life purpose.<br /><br />Anxiety and
          worry will start to fade as you align yourself with loving thoughts.
          Decisions that might have preoccupied you before will become easier to
          make. Difficult events and people will not be drawn to you, because
          you are learning to release that magnetic energy. When you begin to
          consciously surround yourself with the energy of love and acceptance
          —which is your natural state of being —your journey in this physical
          dimension becomes much smoother, more purposeful, and more
          powerful.<br /><br /><i>Be empowered with love . . .</i>

          love’ and explores questions and answers about love in this gem of a
          book. And he clearly shows how love is the master healer. I believe
          you are going to love this book as I do!”<br /><b>— Donna Eden</b
