          You work hard. You put in the hours. Yet you feel like you are
          constantly treading water with "Good Work" that keeps you going but
          never quite moves you ahead. Or worse, you are mired in "Bad
          Work"—endless meetings and energy-draining bureaucratic traps.<br /><br /><i
            >Do More Great Work</i
          >
          gets to the heart of the problem: Even the best performers are
          spending less than a fraction of their time doing "Great Work"—the
          kind of innovative work that pushes us forward, stretches our
          creativity, and truly satisfies us. Michael Bungay Stanier, Canadian
          Coach of the Year in 2006, is a business consultant who’s found a way
          to move us away from bad work (and even good work), and toward more
          time spent doing great work.<br /><br />When you’re up to your
          eyeballs answering e-mail, returning phone calls, attending meetings
          and scrambling to get that project done, you can turn to this
          inspirational, motivating, and at times playful book for invaluable
          guidance. In fifteen exercises, <i>Do More Great Work</i> shows how
          you can finally do more of the work that engages and challenges you,
          that has a real impact, that plays to your strengths—and that
          matters.<br /><br />The exercises are "maps"—brilliantly simple visual
          tools that help you find, start and sustain Great Work, revealing how
          to:<br />Find clues to your own Great Work—they’re all around
          youLocate the sweet spot between what you want to do and what your
          organization wants you to doGenerate new ideas and possibilities
          quicklyBest manage your overwhelming workloadDouble the likelihood
          that you’ll do what you want to do<br />All it takes is ten minutes a
          day, a pencil and a willingness to change.
          <i>Do More Great Work </i>will not only help you identify what the
          Great Work of your life is, it will tell you how to do it.<br /><br />
