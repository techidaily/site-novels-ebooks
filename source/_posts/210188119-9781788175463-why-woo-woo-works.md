          >Alternative therapies, healing modalities, and spiritual practices
          are often referred to as 'woo-woo,' - but many of these approaches are
          actually supported by compelling scientific evidence.<br /><br />In
          this dynamic and thought-provoking book, David R. Hamilton PhD dives
          deeper into the true nature of consciousness and presents the
          cutting-edge research behind energy healing, crystals, meditation, and
          more.<br /><br />You'll discover:<br />· The science behind some of
          today's most popular alternative practices<br />· How your thoughts,
          emotions, and beliefs have healing power<br />· The benefits of nature
          and a holistic approach to healing<br />· A fascinating link between
          consciousness and human connection<br />· The relationship between
          suppressed emotions and disease<br /><br />The ideas behind some of
          these holistic therapies have been around for millennia - but now we
          have scientific evidence demonstrating how they can contribute to
          physical, emotional, and energetic healing too.<br /><br />It's time
          to embrace the truth: That woo-woo really does work.

          "We sometimes call things&nbsp;'woo-woo'&nbsp;not because we're
          experts on those subjects, but because we're not experts and we
          haven't dived into all the available science and research. In this
          book, David has done a stellar job in gathering the science and
          philosophy of a range of seemingly&nbsp;woo-woo&nbsp;subjects and
          shown that they are, in fact, 'true-woo'." - <b>Vex King</b>, #1
          <i>Sunday Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Good Vibes, Good Life</i
          ><br /><br />"Dr. David Hamilton is one of the leading experts in the
          field of the mind‑body connection. As a scientist, he bridges real
          science with human potential in order to prove to you how powerful you
          really are. This book will change your mind." -
          <b>Dr. Joe Dispenza</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best‑selling author of
          <i>You Are the Placebo<br /><br /></i>"Science has historically looked
          askance when faced with traditional healing systems. We now realize
          that alternative therapies and Western methods can be used together to
          reach a state of lasting wellness." - <b>Deepak Chopra</b
          ><br /><br />"<i>Why Woo‑Woo Works</i> is one of the clearest and most
          accurate expositions of alternative mind‑body practices that I’ve had
          the pleasure to read. Hamilton also offers explanations that help to
          demystify the woo‑woo taboo. A delightful and inspiring read." -
          <b>Dean Radin, Ph.D.</b>, Chief Scientist, Institute of Noetic
          Sciences<br /><br />"David is an incredibly inspirational man who I’m
          proud to call a friend. His work has changed the lives of many and he
          stands out because he always strives to explore and answer the
          difficult questions using evidence and science, which in a world full
          of misinformation, is needed. A truly wonderful and fascinating book.
          A must‑read!" - <b>Dr. Punam Krishan</b>, GP, writer, and
          broadcaster<br /><br />"David’s emotionally moving and scientifically
          enlightening book delves deep into the big questions of spirituality
          and science. Read this book to open your mind and heart to the
          tremendous power of alternative therapies." -
          <b>Dr. NNilesh Satguru</b>, GP and high‑performance coach<br /><br />"Reading
          this book is like David giving us a scientific toy arm to finally be
          able to scratch that itch on our back in that unreachable spot for
          those of us who have resonated with woo‑woo since day one, but haven’t
          had the evidence‑based research compiled all in one place to back up
          what we feel and have experienced to be true. If medical students and
          sceptics everywhere were required to read this book, the world would
          be a more harmonious and healthy place." - <b>Kelly Noonan Gores</b>,
          director and executive producer of the
          <i>HEAL</i> documentary<br /><br />"Dr. David Hamilton is uniquely
          placed to give compassionate science‑backed perspectives on the role
          that the mind plays in helping to heal the body. In this book, David
          delves into what we know, whilst making space for what we don’t. The
          world needs more authors – and scientists – like David Hamilton." -
          <b>Dr. Gemma Newman</b>, GP and author of <i>The Plant Power Doctor</i
          ><br /><br />‘As a conscious filmmaker and meditation teacher, I find
          David’s book highly valuable for those scientific nuggets that back up
          what we know intuitively to be true. He helps us all bridge the gap
          from woo‑woo to, yes, you too!" - <b>Adam Schomer</b>, producer of
          <i>HEAL</i> and <i>The Road to Dharma</i>
