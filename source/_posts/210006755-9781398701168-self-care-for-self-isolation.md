              looking after yourself helped you to ride the waves of everyday

            ><br /><br />Self-care might feel like the last thing on your mind
            in the middle of social distancing and self-isolation. And yet
            looking after ourselves, and our health, has never been more
            important. Self-care sisters and bestselling authors Nadia and Katia
            have found their own practices challenged by lockdown and staying at
            home. Here they offer their practical, non-preachy thoughts on how
            to get through this period with your sanity intact.<br /><br /><i
