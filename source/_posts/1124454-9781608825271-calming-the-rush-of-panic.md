            Do you constantly feel anxious? Do you have panic attacks that make
            you feel as though you are about to lose control? You are not alone.
            In fact, anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health
            conditions faced by our society. Perhaps you’ve tried therapy or
            medication and have not found any real, lasting relief for your
            symptoms. So where do you go from here?
          </p>
          <p>
            Calming the Rush of Panic will introduce you to the practices of
            mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)—a proven-effective
            meditational method developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn—as a way to work
            through episodes of panic. After an informative introduction to
            MBSR, you will be guided through a number of exploratory practices
            and meditations to transform your panic into peace." Each chapter in
            the book contains informational background on the topic, guided
            meditations, and up to 10 practices that let you put the information
            and skills you will learn into action.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book promotes mindfulness-based practices and exercises to help
            you deal with the physical, emotional, and mental effects of panic,
            and inside you will learn foundational MBSR meditation practices,
            including mindful breathing, sitting meditation, and loving-kindness
            meditation. If your fear response is out of sync with the situations
            you find yourself in, this book will show you that your thoughts are
            just thoughts—they are just one part of you.
          </p>
          <p>
            This quick, accessible book is the first to use an MBSR approach to
            specifically target panic attacks and panic disorder, and its goal
            is to show you what exists beyond your panic—a life filled with a
            greater sense of calm, connection, and happiness.

          “Grounded in the experiential and direct, this pragmatic approach will
          help you become intimate with the taste, touch, and ‘mind’ of fear. Of
          course, no one wants to look closely at such painful experiences. Yet,
          deftly guided by the authors into developing a clear-minded
          relationship with the unwanted, you’ll learn to catalyze within
          yourself the openness, kindness, clarity, and love that have the power
          to liberate and release you from the knot of panic.”<br />—<strong
