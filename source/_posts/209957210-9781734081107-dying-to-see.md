          A wonderful testament to the healing journey of Janet D. Tarantino
          where she establishes a fantastic relationship between her NDE and the
          spiritual knowledge of the self. It is one of the best NDE books that
          I have read.

          For readers seeking a detailed first-hand account of three near-death
          experiences and their aftereffects, interpreted from a Christian
          perspective yet not limited by the Bible, and addressing the big
          questions of spirit, meaning, and purpose in life, this book will
          tantalize and provide much to ponder.

          In Dying to See, Janet Tarantino shares her deeply personal and
          spiritual near-death experiences. Janet's Christ-centered experiences
          gave her life greater context and perspective. Now, in Dying to See,
          she generously and courageously shares what she learned.

        <p>
          Dying to See is a richly detailed account of three unique near-death
          experiences that unfolded from different perspectives. First, as a
          young child, she was left wondering what she had witnessed in the
          clouds, and later as a young Mother, given a chance to view future
          life events and stay to intervene. After seeing what an important role
          she would play in her son's life, she knew she must return.&nbsp;Dying
          to See bears witness that Janet has another significant role on this
          earth, and through her eloquent writing, she shares her testimonial of
          God's unconditional love for each one of us. This book is a warm
          glimpse into the afterlife and a must-read.

          After many years of silence, Janet Tarantino courageously steps out of
          the shadows to reveal her intimate story of not only one but three
          near-death experiences. In Dying to See, she opens our awareness by
          lifting the veils of illusion of this 3rd-dimensional reality, helping
          us see that there is so much more than what meets the eye. If you are
          new to this phenomenon, you will be fascinated as she takes you on a
          journey revealing spiritual truths and insights. If you have had your
          own personal NDE, Janet's story may sound familiar and will validate
          and permit you to share your own. In these awakening times, Dying to
          See is a valuable beacon for those seeking a broader perspective and a
          timely reminder that we are all eternal beings of light and the love
          of One Universal consciousness.&nbsp;

        <p>
          We all look for answers and the meaning of life - whether we are ill
          or have had a loved one pass and suffer from grief. Dying to See gives
          us those answers and so much more. We can all live a life of purpose,
          gratitude, and love, knowing when the final moment comes, we merely
          close our eyes in this world and reopen them in our natural home in
          Heaven. Janet shares such gems of spiritual wisdom to help us live a
          great life, plus some great drawings of what she saw on the Other
          Side. This inspiring and beautifully written book is undoubtedly a
          gift to the world.
