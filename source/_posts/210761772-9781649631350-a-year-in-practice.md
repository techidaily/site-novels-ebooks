              >“If you’re looking to get still, turn inward, and learn to trust
              your voice, this is the book for you.” —Alexandra Elle,
              <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>How We Heal</i></b
            ><br /><br />“The seasons and cycles of nature have incredible power
            to affect everything in our lives—especially our creativity,” says
            poet Jacqueline Suskin. “The Earth shows us when our creative
            reserves might wax and wane. When we listen and follow nature’s
            lead, we tune in to an inexhaustible source of imagination,
            inspiration, and beauty.” With <i>A Year in Practice</i>, this
            inspiring teacher shares holistic practices to help creatives of all
            sorts access the limitless potential that flows with the rhythms of
            nature.<br />Set in sync with the progression of the seasons,
            <i>A Year in Practice </i>is a program of techniques and journaling
            prompts to guide the creative seeker all year long. Four seasonally
            themed chapters keep you connected to natural phases of creative
            contraction and expansion:<br />• Winter invites restoration so you
            can come back to your craft with renewed energy• Spring is a time of
            balance, focusing on the magic of emergence while embodying
            discretion• Summer is the season of togetherness, instilling
            confidence to bring our creations into the light• Autumn asks us to
            turn back toward ourselves as we prepare for another winter of
            introspection<br />Used regularly, you will move through creative
            blocks, deepen your capacity for self-reflection, expand imaginative
            growth, and find new levels of inspiration and contentment.<br />“It’s
            crucial that we spend time dreaming, crafting, and resting in a
            state of reverie,” says Suskin. Here she offers practical tools and
            creative customs to help you tune in to the energies of each
            season—to enrich your creativity through playfulness, emotional
            expression, explorative whimsy, and ever-deepening levels of
            imagination.

          "Lyrical prose and a cohesive structure make this accessible to
          dabblers and committed artists alike." —<b>Publishers Weekly</b
          ><br /><br />“If you’re looking to get still, turn inward, and learn
          to trust your voice, this is the book for you. Suskin guides us
          through a self-inquiry practice that is deeply resonant and
          beautiful.” —<b>Alexandra Elle</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author of<i> How We Heal</i><br /><br />“Using the poetry of our
          lives, <i>A Year in Practice</i> shifts our notions of time and space
          from linear to cyclical. By reshaping time, we can foster acceptance
          and meaning by working with the seasonal tides and not against them.
          This book is a grounding force for any creative practice to flourish,
          however you define it. <i>A Year in Practice</i> is an agent for
          connection, for expressing big feelings, for exploring the ‘why’ and
          tending to your creative self.” —<b>Carissa Potter Carlson</b>, artist
          and founder of People I’ve Loved<br /><br />“Jacqueline Suskin’s<i>
            A Year in Practice </i
          >invites us to utilize our connection to nature as seasonal beings in
          devotion to our creative practice with such care, nourishment, and
          aliveness. Filled with soulful poetry and prose, wise creative wisdom,
          and deeply rooted practices, this book is a balm and a lovingly held
          container that allows readers to tune both outward and inward in order
          to create a bridge between ourselves, nature, and creativity.
          <i>A Year in Practice</i> weaves the practical and the unseen in ways
          that illuminate how we can relate to both the tangible actions and the
          mystery that hold our creative practices. The tender and unique
          approach Suskin takes is one that I know will ignite and nurture my
          own creative practice for years to come.” —<b>Lisa Olivera</b>, author
          of<i> Already Enough</i><br /><br />“I want every artist to read this
          book. We’re all so exhausted and burnt out from toiling in this
          digital capitalist hellscape, and Suskin provides the most brilliant
          solution I’ve seen: follow the earth’s lead. She reverently walks us
          through the seasons, pointing out the elegant natural order that
          already exists and how a balanced creative practice is less like a
          factory and more like a tree. What a relief.” —<b>Hallie Bateman</b>,
          coauthor of<i> What to Do When I’m Gone</i>, author of
          <i>Directions</i><br /><br />“In our busy culture it is so easy to
          forget ourselves and our internal compass. It is why as artists we
          must return to our seasonal rhythms both inwardly and externally. In
          her brilliant book <i>A Year in Practice</i>, Jacqueline Suskin shows
          us that creative prompts for artistic expression don’t just have to
          come from within, but in fact start with the earth. This book is a
          must-read for anyone who wants to feel less resistance in their
          creative efforts and their day-to-day life. It is a book for our
          times, from one of our greatest poets. May it guide you in seasonal
          creation and dreaming up new worlds to live in.” —<b>Marlee Grace</b>,
          author of <i>How to Not Always Be Working</i> and
          <i>Getting to Center</i><br /><br />“In reverent prose, Jacqueline
          Suskin’s gentle call to action asks us to deepen our attention—to the
          constant guide of the seasons, to the creator within us all pleading
          for direction, to the signs within the body that urge us to contract
          or expand, and to the omnipresent cycles that guide our daily lives.
          <i>A Year in Practice</i> is a practical guide and a tender companion
          through the wisdom of the seasons. Suskin invites us to get curious
          about how our personal cycles can (re)align with the flow of natural
          rhythms. Through self-inquiry and observation with the support of
          generative prompts and inspired poems, we are provided an opening, an
          invitation, and a quiet call of remembrance. Despite a severance from
          nature due to the demands of capitalism, Suskin asserts that there is
          a greater rhythm we are asked to fall in step with—a rhythm all living
          things know. In this book, the holy is within reach. Magic and
          mysticism are deeply embedded into the very thing we’ve grown to view
          as commonplace—the structure and passage of time.” —<b
