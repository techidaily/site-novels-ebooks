            Last year I was searching for one theme that would be woven through
            the Gospels of which, undeniably, love was at the base of them all.
            In my investigation, I discovered a lot of contributing themes that
            were hidden just beneath the surface, so I thought I would get out
            my spiritual shovel and start digging. And when I did, I discovered
            hidden treasures.

            On days when you just need a pick me up, this book will get your
            mind off your depression or challenges. Some readers say it's
            inspirational and will reveal ah-ha moments right before your eyes.

            Just the other day I was challenging myself concerning the next
            music release, which entails a new genre of music for our kids and
            grandkids. I was so overwhelmed by the challenge that I forgot who
            the real source of my success is. I started flipping through this
            book and ran into the exact story I needed to continue down this
            road.

            We still have to do the work, but it's as if the huge door in front
            of us have hands on ours, helping to push. So that's what you will
            experience as the ground around you becomes unearthed and you will
            find hidden treasures in your field.

            I recently discovered the ERV (Easy Reading Version). It breaks the
            verses down to more of a digestible language. There is nothing worse
            than to read a whole chapter and then start scratching your head
            wondering, What did He say?
          </p>
          <p>
            I love following our Savior's example of storytelling, so I have
            lots of stories, experiences, and testimonials woven throughout a
            book of memoirs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pray this experience will help you see a fresh new side of Jesus
            and find hidden treasures in your field.

            Since 1999, my father started encouraging Leon to write a book. He
            would say, "If you've got something to say, write it down." Well
            this book is a product of that encouragement and a true "Treasure"
            indeed.

            Leon Patillo's life is a true "God story." His music, love for Jesus
            and zest for life are interwoven into a multicolored tapestry of
            miracles and grace. I have known Leon for many years. He has
            ministered at our church and college, and each time, he has left
            behind a lasting shimmer of God's beauty and grace. His life is a
            testimony of a man sold-out to the King of Kings!

            I have known Leon, 4 decades. In the beginning of our relationship,
            he mentored me during our concert tour in Europe. Leon Patillo, is
            who God used to help me discover, "Hidden Treasures" in my life!
