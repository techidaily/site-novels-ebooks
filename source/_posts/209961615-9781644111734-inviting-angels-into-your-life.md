          A powerful, step-by-step manual for living joyfully with the help of
          the angels and Archangels <br /><br />• Offers simple and practical
          exercises to connect with 15 Archangels, access angelic help and
          healing, and manage your energy levels and higher vibration in a
          chaotic and demanding world <br /><br />• Explains when each Archangel
          becomes active, notes their color and associated crystal, and offers a
          visualization to connect with each angel <br /><br />• Shows how to
          safely open the channel to communicate with the angelic realm and how
          to co-create with the angels <br /><br />Angels come to us in many
          ways: through the lyrics of a song we hear, a timely hand on the
          shoulder, or a book we happen upon. Angels come to our aid to help us
          feel safe and help our hearts open wide, so our light and our love
          shine through. <br /><br />After a powerful visit from an angel helped
          her transform her fast-paced, chaotic, and addiction-filled Manhattan
          banker lifestyle, author Kathryn Hudson decided to pay it forward and
          help others discover that each of us is surrounded by angels to help
          us. In this book, she shows how to safely open the channel to
          communicate with the angelic realm in order to access the help the
          angels are so willing to provide. She offers simple and practical
          exercises for connecting with 15 Archangels and shows how each of
          these Archangels brings specific Divine qualities to assist and
          support you. She explains when each Archangel becomes active, notes a
          color and a crystal associated with them, and offers a unique
          visualization exercise to connect with the essence of the individual
          angel, inviting this quality into your life. Each angel also provides
          a powerful message about this turning point in human evolution.
          <br /><br />Exploring inner child work, chakra practices, and
          exercises for purification and harmonization of relationships, Kathryn
          reveals the importance of releasing the weight of the past in order to
          open up to angelic guidance about the future. Working with angelic
          healing, she shows how to handle our energy levels in a chaotic and
          draining world and maintain a higher vibration. Taking you from simple
          questions and requests to direct experience and actual co-creation
          with the angelic realm, this guide reveals how to team up with our
          friends in high places to open your heart and live out your highest
          and best version of yourself in this life.
