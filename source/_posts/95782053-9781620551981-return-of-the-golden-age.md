          The truth behind ancient myths and the return of the celestial
          conditions for a Golden Age of peace and abundance <br />
          <br />• Reveals the events preserved in myth that launched humanity
          into 12,000 years of struggle, selfishness, and false beliefs <br />
          <br />• Explores how we can initiate a new Golden Age through ancient
          Egyptian teachings on the creative power of our imaginations <br />
          <br />• Explains how our world system of economics, which benefits a
          few at the expense of the many, arose as a reaction to global
          catastrophe in prehistory <br />
          <br />Since the beginning of recorded history humanity has been in a
          continuous struggle over land and resources. It continues today
          despite the abundance we have created through scientific innovation
          and technology. Why such a struggle for resources exists has never
          been explained. Neither has the human drive to own, accumulate, and
          hoard. Edward Malkowski reveals that the answer lies in recognizing
          the reality behind humanity’s earliest myths. He shows that the
          opportunity is at hand to transcend these inherited selfish traits and
          return to a Golden Age of peace and abundance. <br />
          <br />Malkowski explores the hidden meaning behind stories such as the
          Epic of Gilgamesh, Plato’s Atlantis, and myths of a new sky and a new
          sun, of great floods and the death of the gods, and of the preceding
          Golden Age. He connects these myths to a real extinction event that
          occurred 12,000 years ago. He explains how the survivors--our
          ancestors--were catapulted from utopia into a world of scarcity,
          scarring the collective mind of humanity and initiating the struggle
          for resources in an attempt to regain our lost paradise. He shows how
          our world system of economics, focused on ownership and based on the
          false belief of separateness--benefitting a few at the expense of the
          many--arose as a reaction to this catastrophe. <br />
          <br />Drawing on the pre-catastrophe teachings preserved by the
          ancient Egyptians, Malkowski reveals that we are returning to a
          celestial configuration parallel to that of the past Golden Age.
          Through our collective DNA memory and the creative power of our
          imaginations, we can end our 12,000-year quest to regain paradise lost
          and launch a new Golden Age of unity, abundance, and equality for all
          humanity.

          “Can our educational, social and economic systems change from their
          emphasis on how to make money to buy more stuff to an emphasis on
          embracing higher consciousness and expanded awareness as the goals in
          life? Can we rise up from our narrow, self-centered lives to become
          people of genuine wisdom? Author, Ed Malkowski thinks we can, and he
          and others see it beginning to happen in the midst of the mess we have
          now. Let’s hope he’s right.”
