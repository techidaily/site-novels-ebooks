            What is feminine energy and how much of it do you have? Or perhaps
            you believe that you don't have any? Addressed to both men and women
            who seek their own authenticity and their own definition of what
            being a man or a woman is, The 10 principles of the Feminine is
            about discovering what feminine energy is -- beyond any dictionary
            definition -- and why it's important to honour and cultivate it.
            Feminine energy is not an attribute of the fairer sex; it is a
            component of all living things, and its true meaning seems to have
            been lost somewhere and, with it, people's potential of authentic
            self-expression. So identifying feminine energy in yourself and
            others, and connecting to it, is essential for leading a balanced
            and fulfilling life. If you don't feel fulfilled or seen, then
            perhaps you aren't in tune with your feminine aspect. The 10
            principles outlined in here are meant to guide the reader towards a
            better understanding and appreciation of the feminine, which beyond
            everything, represents our inner power and capacity to connect to
            the eternal and the ethereal, as well as to seek and find true love.
            This book is therefore a practical guide for integrating the
            spiritual aspect into our earthly existence, reconciling the
            feminine with the masculine in an approachable and concise way,
            without pertaining to a certain spiritual or religious ideology.

          I have been curious about feminine and masculine while on my own
          journey to find this balance within me. This is so beautifully written
          I couldnâ€™t stop reading. I gained so much valuable information to help
          me grow. I love giving books as gifts to friends who are on a similar
          journey to mine and this will definitely be shared with them. Thank
          you, Roxana, for this gift!
