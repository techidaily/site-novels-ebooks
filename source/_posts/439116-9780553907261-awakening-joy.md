            Joy is not for just the lucky few–it’s a choice anyone can make. In
            this groundbreaking book, based on his popular course, James Baraz
            helps you discover a path to the happiness that’s right in front of
            you, offering a step-by-step program that will reorient your mind
            away from dissatisfaction and distraction and toward the contentment
            and delight that is abundantly available in our everyday lives.<br /><br />You
            can decide to be happy. For years, James Baraz’s online Awakening
            Joy course has offered participants from around the world the
            benefits of this simple but profoundly radical proposition. Grounded
            in simple Buddhist principles but accessible to people of all
            faiths–or no faith at all–this concept provides the jumping-off
            point for a transformational journey toward a richer, more
            meaningful, more positive outlook on life. Now readers everywhere
            can follow the same ten steps Baraz teaches to his program
            participants. In this practical down-to-earth guide, you will learn
            how to<br /><br />• make happiness a habit by inclining your mind
            toward states that lead to well-being<br />• find joy even during
            difficult times and avoid the pitfalls that prevent you from
            achieving the contentment you seek<br />• cultivate effective
            practices for sustaining joyfulness, such as reclaiming your natural
            sense of wonder and finding joy in the midst of everyday
            experiences<br /><br />Each chapter of <b>Awakening Joy</b> consists
            of one step in Baraz’s ten-step program and includes engaging
            exercises and practical advice to make happiness your natural
            default setting. For everyone from the cynic despondent over life’s
            many sorrows to the harried commuter raging at freeway traffic, this
            book offers up a simple yet powerful message of hope grounded in the
            realization that joy already exists inside every one of us. Like a
            precious child, it only needs to be recognized, embraced, and
            nurtured in order to grow to its full potential.

          considered the essential virtues of the religious life. James Baraz
          has done us all a great service by elevating joy to its rightful place
          alongside the trinity of sacred emotions. What a gift is it, to be
          surprised by joy, and to awaken, in the midst of a difficult world,
