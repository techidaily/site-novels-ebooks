            >An exploration of the traditional rites of auspicious building and
            crafting</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains the ceremonial beginnings and Hermetic
          principles in the laying out of foundations not only for sacred
          buildings like temples but also for homes and barns<br /><br />•
          Examines the principles and ceremonies of electional astrology and
          details how to compute natural time, as opposed to clock time<br /><br />•
          Shares examples from ancient Egypt, Iran, India, and Europe that range
          from the Stone Age to the Renaissance and include secret societies<br /><br />When
          we make things--whether a building, a sacred space, or a magical
          object--there is a precise moment when the artifact comes into being
          as a separate entity. That moment in time possesses its own unique
          quality, and because of this, there is a right time to do something
          and a wrong time. And, as Nigel Pennick reveals, we have the power to
          select favorable moments for our creations, just as our ancestors did.
          <br /><br />Illustrating ancient principles of divination,
          chronomancy, and electional astrology, Pennick examines all the
          factors behind the ancestral art of geomancy: the auspicious creation
          and alignment of sacred buildings as places of power. Sharing examples
          from ancient Egypt, Iran, India, and Europe that range from the Stone
          Age to the modern day, including secret societies like the
          Rosicrucians and the Freemasons, he explains how many cities were
          constructed on specially selected sites and founded ritually at
          precise, predetermined moments. <br /><br />Looking at the traditional
          rites of creating places of power, Pennick explains the ceremonial
          beginnings and Hermetic principles in the laying out of foundations as
          well as the use of sacrifice in the building of many notable
          structures. Examining the role of sacred geometry in geomancy, Pennick
          explains the Hermetic meaning assigned to each direction in
          traditional European cultures as well as the principles of natural
          measures and the science of understanding lucky and unlucky days.
          <br /><br />Revealing how geomantic principles are rooted in the
          structure of the world and the cosmic patterns of space and time, the
          author shows how they transcend the ages and are just as meaningful
          today as they were to our ancestors.
