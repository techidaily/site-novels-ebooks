          <p>
            My real thoughts about my motivation for writing "The Human Phase
            2025":
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, I just wanted to get the thing out there to do my small
            contribution. I had heard about negative end-times prophecies, and
            that they were likely to occur because "nobody on Earth was doing
            anything to stop them." I wanted to express my faith in our
            abilities to get past the violent animal-like behavior that
            threatens our survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            There has been a huge amount of information to digest in the last
            few decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I want to explain a little more: It is obvious to me that I know
            less today than I thought I did yesterday. Yet, I feel more
            enthusiastic than ever because of the training that I have been
            privileged to receive. I call this training because patterns show up
            in the way things happen in my life. I will get an interest in
            something, so I study it out and learn until I move on to something
            else. Then, later on what I just happened to study in the past turns
            out to be just what I needed. I do not even question these patterns
            anymore; it is normal for me. You can call it whatever you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            My primary motivation to help this planet started when I saw my
            first commercials decades ago on TV about starving children on the
            other side of the world. I was raised Catholic, and my family has
            shown me great love and compassion for all of my life. It bothers me
            a great deal to think of anyone suffering or being miserable.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, when I learned about zero-point energy theories, our brain
            waves, non-linear fractal resonance, quantum mechanics, and our
            incredible brains and minds, I could see a pattern again showing up.
            In this case I see us doing what you would call magic- causing
            changes in the structure of the materials around us with our will or
            intent or energy or whatever label you want to use. Of course, we
            already cause changes in our environment, so it is only a matter of
            figuring out the codes that unlock the abilities to transmute
            existing materials into food and clothing and the problem is solved.
            This sounds cool, until one tries to explain the ideas without
            sounding crazy! Then, if you factor in some of the incredible
            technologies that are reported to exist on other worlds, it seems
            like we just must get access to the systems that are already in
            place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have made mistakes, so I believe in letting others have second
            chances. I will not go into the exact details of my methods, as I
            only have some initial ideas floating around in there somewhere but
            suffice to say that I am researching ways to "encourage" people to
            not only stop their negative actions in order to heal their own
            lives, but to imagine being changed into something worthwhile which
            will endure. By encourage I mean to show what might be possible with
            everyone working together as a group. There is a part in the Bible
            that says to warn the person if they are doing wrong. Imagine a
            number of us expecting a great wave of energy that makes doing good
            very appealing to people! I am a survivor and I want all of us to
            make it. Have a wonderful day. MS
