          In this book, philosopher Paul Brunton (1898-1981) encounters the
          mysteries and magic of Egypt in the 1930s, including an eerie yet
          illuminating night spent alone inside the Great Pyramid. Alongside his
          explorations of ancient Egypt's monuments and gods, Brunton encounters
          a variety of occultists, fakirs, and dervishes, and even manages to
          become initiated into the deadly art of snake charming. His frank
          interviews with Muslim leaders remain relevant today, and his
          description of the Hajj reflects the beauty and inspiring faith of
          Mohammad's true followers. Brunton's journey to discover the furthest
          reaches of what the mind and body are capable of--and to distinguish
          various forms of yoga and magic from true spirituality--lead him to
          the myth of Osiris and to the mystery that is the Sphinx itself. In
          the end, Brunton turns his attention to his own spiritual path,
          connecting all of his experiences into a single discovery: that we are
          more than the body and that the freedom of our spirit can be
          experienced here and now. This new edition has been updated to
          incorporate Brunton's final revisions and includes an introduction by
          the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foundation.&nbsp; <br /><br />

          evolution that illumines the pathways of a future humanity."
          <br />—Jean Houston, author of <i>A Passion for the Possible</i> and

          spiritual ideas will find a surprising challenge and an authentic

          Paul Brunton." <br />—Jacob Needleman, author of
          <i>What Is God?&nbsp;</i> <br /><br />“ … an elaborate account of
          strange happenings and beliefs, <i>A Search in Secret Egypt</i> is an
          engrossing book.…”<br />—<i>Times-Union</i> [Brooklyn]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “It must be recorded to the lasting credit of Paul Brunton that what
          he has suffered and achieved very few people would ever be willing to
          do.… One cannot really help admiring his zeal for daring enterprise,
          his totally unbiased and critical mind.”<br />—<i>The Leader</i>
          [Allahabad, India] <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Mr. Brunton's book does not make us wonder whether there are not more
          things in heaven and earth than are known to our philosophy; it makes
          us certain that there are.”<br />—<i>News-Review</i> [London] <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “For all his love of the untoward, Mr. Brunton clearly distinguishes
          between what is spiritual and what is magical or super-normal, and it
          is just this which makes his book not only a fascinating but a
          valuable guide to the hidden lore of ancient times.”<br />—<i
            >The Inquirer</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “ … his book remains fascinating as the account of a traveler far less
          prejudiced and much better instructed than the average.
          <i>A Search in Secret Egypt</i> contains many excellent pen-pictures
          of the Two Lands and their monuments, as well as numerous accounts of
          literally marvelous adventures in that 'temple of the whole world' we
          call Egypt.”<br />—<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Believe it or not—this book will thrill you.”<br />—<i

        </h4>
        <p>
          PAUL BRUNTON (1898-1981) is one of the twentieth century's most
          brilliant spiritual writers. He is generally recognized as having
          introduced yoga&nbsp;and meditation to the West. His books sold over
          two million copies in 17 languages. He was the most popular and
          authoritative source of information on Eastern philosophies, gurus,
          and meditation systems from the mid-'30s to the '60s. In 1954, he
          withdrew from public life and continued writing the material that was
          posthumously published as <i>The Notebooks of Paul Brunton</i>--a
          truly East-West spiritual philosophy. Written with the passion of an
          authentic pioneer and the thoughtfulness of a seasoned practitioner,
          his work is re-emerging as a beacon for all contemporary seekers.
