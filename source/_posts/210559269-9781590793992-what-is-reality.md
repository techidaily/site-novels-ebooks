            Ervin Laszlo's tour de force,&nbsp;<i>What is Reality?</i>, is the
            product of a half-century of deep contemplation and cutting-edge
            scholarship. Addressing many of the paradoxes that have confounded
            modern science over the years, it offers nothing less than a new
            paradigm of reality, one in which the cosmos is a seamless whole,
            informed by a single, coherent consciousness manifest in us all.
            Bringing together science, philosophy, and metaphysics, Laszlo takes
            aim at accepted wisdom, such as the dichotomies of mind and body,
            spirit and matter, being and nonbeing, to show how we are all part
            of an infinite cycle of existence unfolding in spacetime and
            beyond.<br />Augmented by insightful commentary from a dozen
            scholars and thinkers, along with a foreword by Deepak Chopra and an
            introduction by Stanislav Grof,&nbsp;<i>What is Reality?</i
            >&nbsp;offers a fresh and liberating understanding of the meaning
            and purpose of existence.
