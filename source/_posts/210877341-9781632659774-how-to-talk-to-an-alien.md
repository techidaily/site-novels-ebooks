          ><br /><br />In 1972, American astronomer and ufologist J. Allen Hynek
          first coined the term “close encounter.” He also identified three
          types of close encounters with UFOs. Since then, several more types of
          encounters have been proposed. A close encounter of the fourth kind is
          an alien abduction. A closer encounter of the fifth kind is voluntary,
          bilateral contact with an alien species.<br /><br />We are no longer
          just looking at strange flying objects in the skies; now we are
          beginning to interact with the actual pilots, crew, and passengers!<br /><br />Do
          aliens exist? In 2013, one poll showed that nearly half of all
          Americans (48 percent) believe UFOs may be a sign of extraterrestrial
          visitation; another found that 10 percent of Americans claim to have
          actually witnessed an actual UFO; and yet another showed that 2.9
          million Americans believe they had actually been abducted by
          aliens.<br /><br />If aliens exist and are visiting us, we need to
          talk!<br /><br />Who will speak to them on behalf of planet Earth? Who
          can translate their intentions—good or evil—toward the human race? How
          can we learn about their advanced technologies? Can aliens speak human
          languages?<br /><br />These and even more fascinating questions are
          all addressed in <i>How to Talk to an Alien</i>.<br /><br />“Nancy du
          Tertre covers the various considerations involved with
          extraterrestrial communication, including the use of alien technology,
          ET linguistics, and the possibility of using telepathy and dreams. Her
          handbook for the future should be on every thinking person’s
          bookshelf.” —Jim Marrs, <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author
