          The first comprehensive presentation of the core teachings of the
          Kalahari Bushmen as told by the Tribal Elders <br />
          <br />• Reveals how the Bushmen are able to receive direct
          transmissions of God’s love for healing and spiritual transformation
          <br />
          <br />• Explores tribal legends and teaching tales, the importance of
          dreams and animals, and the origins of their dances, rituals, and
          ceremonies <br />
          <br />Step into the imaginative realm of one of the oldest continuous
          cultures on Earth, the Kalahari Ju/’hoansi Bushmen. Translated by
          Beesa Boo, a Bushman, and interspersed with detailed commentary from
          Bradford and Hillary Keeney, this book presents the core teachings of
          the Kalahari Bushmen as told by the tribal elders themselves. Decades
          in the making, it constitutes the first comprehensive work on the
          world’s oldest tradition of healing and spiritual experience. <br />
          <br />Told in their own words, these teachings reveal how the Bushmen
          are able to receive direct transmissions of God’s love in the form of
          the universal life force, <i>n/om</i>. The individuals who are filled
          with this force describe it as an awakened, energized feeling of love
          that inspires a spontaneous and heightened ecstatic awareness that
          opens mystical perception. Having your heart transfixed by this force
          enables true healing and spiritual growth to occur. Experiencing the
          force in your entire being, through a vision of “God’s egg”, awakens
          deep spiritual wisdom and extraordinary healing gifts. Those who “own
          the egg” are blessed with the ability to have direct communication
          with the Divine, a “rope to God,” and can communicate with others for
          all “ropes” are connected. <br />
          <br />Conveying the deep love that is the dominant emotion of Bushman
          spirituality, the book explores tribal legends and teaching tales, the
          importance of dreams and encounters with animals, the origins of their
          dances, such as the giraffe dance, and specific rituals and
          ceremonies, including puberty rites for boys and girls. <br />
          <br />“As the elder teachers of the Ju’/hoan Bushman (San) people, we
          hold the most enduring traditional wisdom concerning healing and
          spiritual experience. This book is a testimony of our ecstatic ways.
          We happily share our basic teachings about spirituality and healing
          with those whose hearts are sincerely open.”

          “First and foremost, Bradford Keeney has danced with the San (Bushmen)
          and met them at a kinesthetic level of understanding that is
          unparalleled in previous anthropological research. Having met the
          elder healers on their own terms, Brad developed a deep relationship
          that brought a new voice and insight to the representation and
          interpretation of their healing dance. Hillary and Brad have a very
          special physical and academic skillset and an exceptional dedication
          to research. This book reveals new depths in the beliefs and practices
          of San (Bushman) healing that will hopefully be as valuable for the
          San (Bushmen) as a record and guide in a fast-changing world as it is
          for the wider world to appreciate these extraordinary people.”
