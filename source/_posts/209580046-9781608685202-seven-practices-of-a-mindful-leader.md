            >What would your work and your life look like if you knew how to
            stay focused yet flexible, if you got more of the right things done,

          “A mindful leader makes the work environment a generative social field
          in which compassion, connection, and creativity thrive. The seven
          accessible practices in this book can teach you how to become just
          such a leader.”<br />
          — from the foreword by <strong>Daniel J. Siegel, MD</strong>,
          executive director of Mindsight Institute<br />
          <br />
          Today’s leaders are grappling with the pace and complexity of change,
          the challenge of supporting healthy collaboration and alignment among
          teams, and the resulting stress and burnout. The practice of mindful
          leadership may be one of the most important competencies in business
          today if leaders are to move beyond fear, anxiety, nagging self-doubt,
          and the feeling of constant overwhelm.<br />
          <strong><br /></strong>Marc Lesser has taught his proven seven-step
          method to leaders at Google, Genentech, SAP, Facebook, and dozens of
          other Fortune 500 companies for over twenty years and has distilled a
          lifetime of mindfulness and business experience into these chapters.
          This incredibly practical yet accessible book draws on Marc’s
          experience as a CEO of three companies, as cofounder of the
          world-renowned Search Inside Yourself (SIY) program within Google, and
          as a longtime Zen practitioner.<br />
          <br />
          The principles in this book can be applied to leadership at any level,
          providing readers with the tools they need to shift awareness, enhance
          communication, build trust, eliminate fear and self-doubt, and
          minimize unnecessary workplace drama.<br />
          <br />
          Embracing any one of the seven practices alone can be life-changing.
          When used together, they support a path of well-being, productivity,
          and positive influence.<br />
          <br />
          Practicing mindful leadership will allow you to achieve results — with
          more energy, clarity, meaning, and connection. Your intentions and
          actions will be more aligned. You will accomplish more with less
          wasted effort.<strong><br /></strong><br />
          After reading this book, you’ll understand why some of the world’s
          most successful companies routinely incorporate the
          <strong>Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader</strong>, integrating
          mindfulness, emotional intelligence, and business savvy to create
          great corporate cultures, and even a better world.

          “All of us are leaders in one way or another. In this important new
          book, Marc Lesser applies the power of mindfulness and compassion to
          guiding and bringing out the best in others. Written from a profound
          depth of experience in both Zen monasteries and corporate boardrooms,
          every page sparkles with clarity, humor, and practical suggestions. A
          wonderful book, with a range and depth valuable for both first-time
          managers and top CEOs.”<br />
          <strong>— Rick Hanson, PhD, </strong>author of Resilient: How to Grow
          an Unshakable Core of Calm, Strength, and Happiness<br />
          <br />
          “No matter how we support life, this book will awaken us to what it
          means to be a wise and compassionate leader. This extraordinary book
          brings transparency and wisdom to our work.”<br />
          <strong>— Rev. Joan Jiko Halifax, </strong>abbot of Upaya Zen
          Center<br />
          <br />
          “Clearly articulated, practical, and helpful.”<br />
          <strong>— Mindful magazine<br /> </strong><strong><br /> </strong>“We
          spend one-third of our lives at work, and work is the greatest source
          of stress in many people’s lives. Over the past decade, an immense
          amount of research has documented the power of mindfulness practices
          to decrease stress and anxiety and increase one’s ability to attend.
          Marc Lesser brings a unique combination of skills to address this
          situation, thanks to his training as a Zen priest, his immense
          experience training thousands of individuals in mindfulness, his work
          cofounding one of the leading programs bringing mindfulness and
          emotional intelligence skills to business, and his own experience as a
          business leader. Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader brings together
          this expertise and, I believe, will be an invaluable tool for changing
          the world of business by transforming its leaders.”<br />
          <strong>— James R. Doty, MD, </strong>founder and director of the
          Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education at the
          Stanford University School of Medicine and author of Into the Magic
          Shop: A Neurosurgeon’s Quest to Discover the Mysteries of the Brain
          and the Secrets of the Heart<strong><br /> </strong><br />
          “Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader is a pitch-perfect harmony of
          Marc Lesser’s two lifelong refrains — mindfulness practice and its
          utility in the world of business, practical affairs, and everyday
          life. Stripped of cant and mumbo jumbo, Marc’s gentle explorations of
          ‘great leadership’ expand the boundaries of leadership to include the
          benefits of kindness and compassion to one’s own life and the lives of
          others. There is no one — spiritual practitioner or corporate chief —
          who will not enjoy and benefit from this book.”<br />
          <strong>— Peter Coyote, </strong>author, actor, and Zen Buddhist
          priest<strong><br /> </strong><br />
          “Nourishing reminders, Zen wisdom with heart.”<br />
          <strong>— Jack Kornfield,</strong> cofounder of Spirit Rock Meditation
          Center<strong><br /> </strong><br />
          “With exercises embedded in every chapter, the book encourages readers
          in keeping journals, noticing the breadth and depth of their mind
          wanderings, enumerating dependents, organizing meetings, even in
          figuring out their work style — always with a brief yet poignant
          reminder to keep making it simple.”<br />
          <strong>— Booklist</strong><br />
          <br />
          “As the former head cook of a world-renowned Zen center and cofounder
          of a mindfulness program at Google, Marc Lesser offers the perfect
          recipe for genuine conscious leadership. With his humility, vast
          experience, and engaging, accessible style, Marc skillfully shows how
          to apply the key ingredients of mindfulness to the workplace to bring
          out the best in others while creating an environment that both
          fulfills and nourishes success. A significant contribution. Enjoy the
          feast!”<br />

          “Marc Lesser’s Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader is a wonderful
          explanation of mindfulness practice, covering the skills to cultivate
          compassion and empathy, clarity and self-awareness, and a deeper
          connection to one’s neighbor. While it’s written mainly for executive
          leaders, anyone wanting a mindfulness practice in their life will find
          this book extremely helpful.”<br />
          <strong>— Sharon Salzberg, </strong>author of Lovingkindness and Real
          Happiness<strong><br /> </strong><br />
          “Marc Lesser provides an essential guide for leaders seeking to close
          the gap between the way they are living, working, and leading and
          their highest aspirations for how they wish to live, work, and lead.
          Marc’s experience as a practitioner and teacher of Zen as well as his
          long-standing experience working with companies such as Google, SAP,
          and many other influential global organizations come together in this
          valuable book. It provides practical ways to hone leadership skills in
          the midst of the ever-increasing complexity and demands that all
          leaders face. A must-read for leaders at every level, including those
          who simply wish to lead themselves to more fulfilling work and a
          generative life.”<br />

          <strong>— Retailing Insight</strong><br />
          <br />
          “Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader is an in-depth workbook for
          developing a more soulful approach to mindfulness. A lifetime of
          experience in both business and spiritual-practice environments has
          afforded Marc Lesser a deft way of explaining how and why living with
          more heart promotes effective leadership. I predict that these seven
          simple practices will be used by many. Thank you, Marc!”<br />

          ><br />
          “By bringing his decades of Zen meditation to the challenges of the
          modern workplace, Marc Lesser has discovered a fresh and compassionate
          vision of mindful leadership. For leaders of organizations large or
          small, these simple seven practices offer a wise and practical
          approach to fostering a healthy, dignified workplace and inspiring the
          very best in others.”<br />
          <strong>— Michael Carroll, </strong>author of The Mindful Leader and
          Fearless at Work<br />
          <br />
          “Here is a rare self-help/business book that squarely faces the pain
          of change. Marc Lesser is an experienced guide through rough spots.
          The seven practices he presents are the mature fruit of his own
          practice and, therefore, won’t fail to enrich the life of other
          leaders who practice them.”<br />
          <strong>— Brother David Steindl-Rast, </strong>cofounder of A Network
          for Grateful Living<strong><br /> </strong><br />
          “This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend. Marc Lesser draws
          from his long and unique experience in both inspiring mindful leaders
          and showing how to bring mindfulness into organizations. I am grateful
          that I had the great privilege of working with Marc in training
          mindful leaders and mindfulness teachers, and he was a great mentor
          for me in starting a very successful corporate mindfulness programs at
          SAP. Marc’s deep wisdom, practical knowledge, and love for mindfulness
          applied in profound and yet practical ways shine through on every page
          of this wonderful book. His priceless knowledge is now available to
          everybody. This is a must-read for anyone who would like to become a
          better mindful leader and a more skillful teacher.”<br />
          <strong>— Peter Bostelmann, </strong>director of SAP Global
          Mindfulness Practice<strong><br /> </strong><br />
          “With Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader, Marc Lesser has built an
          everyday bridge to mindfulness for all leaders who want to be more
          aware in their daily lives. At 1440 Multiversity, we believe
          mindfulness only matters when we put it to use, and these teachings
          show everyone seven easy steps to doing exactly that.”<br />
          <strong>— Scott Kriens, </strong>cofounder of 1440 Multiversity<br />
          <br />
          “In Seven Practices of a Mindful Leader, Marc Lesser brings ancient
          Zen wisdom into the modern boardroom. The practices he introduces
          provide a clear pathway toward bringing more of our best human selves
          into our day-to-day leadership.”<br />
