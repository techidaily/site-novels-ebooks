            writer, mystic, devotional creative, and visionary who supports
            hundreds of thousands of people to connect with their soul and weave
            the sacred back into their everyday life.</b

            >Tap into the cosmic nature of your soul, discover your purpose and
            commit to being here on Earth.</b
          ><br /><br /><b>Letters to a Starseed </b>asks the biggest questions
          that mystics and philosophers through the ages have been asking: What
          is the soul, where did it originate and why have we chosen to come
          here at this time?<br /><br /><b
            >YOUR SOUL HAD A DREAM, YOUR LIFE IS IT.</b
          ><br /><br />This is a book for those who at times feel misplaced in
          the world; those who have always felt a remembering of some other
          place without quite knowing what that place really is.<br /><br />As a
          planet, we are waking up to the fact that the ancient prophecies and
          warnings from the elders and wise ones are no longer predictions, but
          our waking reality. They are not just coming or even near ... we are
          living them right now.<br /><br />What we do now matters to the future
          of this planet. And we all have a role to play.<br /><br />Some
          <i>Letters to a Starseed</i> Chapter Titles include:<br /><br />· Who
          Are We and Where Did We Come From?<br />· The Moment of Your Birth<br />·
          What Is a Starseed?<br />· Ancient Stars in Our Bones<br />· Reaching
          Back to the Ancients<br />· Here We Are<br />· Returning<br />· The
          Longing for Home<br />· I Remember<br />· Why Did You Come Here?<br />·
          There Must Be More Than This<br />· Why Did You Choose to Come?<br />·
          We All Have a Role to Play, but Only We Know What<br />· Our Role
          Is<br />· There You Are<br />· I Have Music in My Heart<br />· Finding
          Our Ground<br />· Starseed Roles<br />· Plant Yourself Here<br />· How
          to Feel More at Home on Earth<br />· The Challenge of Being Human<br />·
          Incarnation<br />· The Original Severing<br />· Plant Yourself Here<br /><br /><b
            >We are living in a time between myths and stories, and are
            currently re-weaving the fabric of life on Earth. Throughout this
            book, Rebecca shares insights and experiences illuminating the
            connection between our souls, the Earth and the cosmos, to encourage
            you to commit fully to your incarnation, embrace your human
            experience and plant yourself here.</b
          ><br /><br />“Throughout the book you’ll find two prompts, which will
          support you on your journey as you read.<br /><br />“In many chapters,
          you’ll find Soul Inquiry prompts that will help you hear the calls of
          your soul as you journey through the book.<br /><br />“In some
          chapters, you’ll also find activations. These are here to support you
          in activating and integrating energies and healing within you, from
          your soul to your cells.<br /><br />“My hope for this book is that it
          supports, comforts, and inspires you to remember who you truly are and
          why you chose to be here at this pivotal moment in the story of
          humanity. To commit fully to being here and being present to your life
          on Earth at this time.<br /><br />“To encourage you to play the note
          that you came here to play, without waver.<br /><br /><i
