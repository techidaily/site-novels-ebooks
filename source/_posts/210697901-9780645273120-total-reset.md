            In 1991 the author met Lulu, a widely-respected Aboriginal elder and
            powerful maban (shaman) in the remote Kimberley region of Australia
            who asked Greg to work with him and the Goolarabooloo people to
            write one book. Its purpose was clear: enable people to view reality
            through the lens of original knowledge and apply it for the
            well-being of one another and our Whole Earth system. Total Reset is
            the result of the 31-year collaboration.

            Though many are increasingly concerned about what is happening on
            our planet as its sixth mass extinction event unfolds (the first
            driven by people), the focus is usually on the latest cracks in the
            dam wall and how to fix them. The root cause - the dam's existence
            in the form of the constructs of post-Neolithic societies - remains
            unaddressed. As a result, the only change in a multi-millennia
            trajectory towards the precipice is the speed, which appears to be
            going exponential. Traditional Indigenous elders such as Lulu
            maintain that sapiens' original knowledge provided all peoples with
            a blueprint for living respectfully on Earth. Known by the First
            Australians as First Law (and by others as Earth Law or Natural
            Law), it operated from Day One to preserve the balance of all life.
            No ordinary blueprint, it is a cosmic pattern showing the elements
            of the whole system and their connectedness; a holistic model able
            to be fully embraced by all people.

            Part 1 of Total Reset considers how humanity's present predicament
            arose, provides an evidence-backed summation of our world's
            endangered state and then contrasts modern socio-economic settings
            with those of traditional Indigenous peoples. Interwoven through
            information-rich chapters are stories from the author's life
            illustrating how opening to the oneness reality positively impacts
            individuals and society. Part 2 explores sapiens' original knowledge
            of unified modes of living and being on Earth, pointing to
            commonalities of the structures, systems and ways of the many
            different societies of our world's oldest continuous cultures, those
            of the First Peoples of Australia. It is enriched by stories of the
            author's experiences with Lulu and his people. Part 3 begins with a
            classic illustration of the exploitative nature of modern societies
            by describing the 2005-13 Battle for Walmadany when some of the
            world's largest corporations joined with governments to
            industrialise sacred land. Their failure to overcome the
            Goolarabooloo's inspired defence brought into focus life-affirming
            alternatives to exploitative mindsets and practices. When anyone
            looks at reality through the lens of original knowledge such as that
            shared in Total Reset, it opens boundless opportunities for
            innovative solutions to remove threats to the continuity of all life
            and drive a return to balance. Accordingly, Part 3 outlines some of
            many possible strategies - at the global, national, regional/local
            and individual levels. They include the regeneration of autonomous,
            interdependent local communities anchored by holistic worldviews
            where custodial care of a toxic-free natural world is demonstrated,
            non-financial values prevail and notions of kinship and self are
            expanded.

            At this critical time in the human saga, the real solution is not a
            further expansion of globalist rule under the guise of The Great
            Reset, it is a rapid evolutionary adaptation in the form of a Total
            Reset of how people live on Earth, propelling the re-emergence of
            societies free of wars of conquest and control, whose people live in
            a non-disruptive balanced relationship with the natural world and
            experience meaningful, empowered lives of dignity and freedom. After
            all, the evidence suggests it is how the First Peoples lived for not
            less than 2,600 genera

          Total Reset is an exploration of the human spirit. In my Nyikina
          language we call this liyan; our moral compass, intuition, values and
          knowing that connects our human being to the universal lifeforce. The
          richness of Greg's journey teaches us to see and be in the world a
          different way. This 'tru stori' is a series of diverse experiences,
          each bringing a new learning to illuminate a deeper understanding of
          characteristics of the human spirit.

          Today the true depth of First Nations knowledge and its extraordinary
          remedial significance for our out-of-balance times is finally starting
          to be recognized. By way of this precious record of his years with
          Lulu, combined with his own reflections on the urgent and far-reaching
          relevance of Lulu's teachings, Greg adds to this great new awakening
          to the need for First Nations leadership and wisdom.
