            The author of 'The Science of Getting Rich' brings you<strong>
              'The Science of Being Great'</strong
            >. Wallace D. Wattles introduced the world to the power of positive
            thinking. Greatness is equally inherent in all and therefore every
            person may become great. Man may overcome both heredity and
            circumstances by exercising the inherent creative power of the
            soul.<br />Talent may merely be one faculty developed out of
            proportion to other faculties, but genius is the union of man and
            God in the acts of the soul. Great men are always greater than their
            deeds. They are in connection with a reserve of power that is
            without limit. We do not know where the boundary of the mental
            powers of man is; we do not even know that there is a boundary.

            <strong>About the Author:</strong><br /><strong
              >Wallace D. Wattles</strong
            >
            was an American author and a pioneer success writer. A practical
            author, Wattles encouraged his readers to test his theories on
            themselves rather than take his word as an authority, and he claimed
            to have tested his methods on himself and others before publishing
            them.<br />Born in the mid 1800s during the War between the States,
            Wallace D. Wattles experienced a life of failure after failure,
            until he formulated and put into practice the principles laid out in
            'The Science of Getting Rich'.<br />His daughter Florence notes that
            in those last years, "He wrote almost constantly. It was then that
            he formed his mental picture. He saw himself as a successful writer,
            a personality of power, an advancing man, and he began to work
            toward the realization of this vision. He lived every page... His
            life was truly the powerful life."<br />Although Mr. Wattles died
            relatively young, and although his work was largely forgotten for
            years, those who have studied and applied these principles
            throughout the 20th century have experienced remarkable results.
            They have gotten rich!<br />Rhonda Byrne told a Newsweek interviewer
            that her inspiration for creating the 2006 hit film The Secret and
            the subsequent book by the same name, was her exposure to Wattles's
            The Science of Getting Rich. Byrne's daughter, Hayley, had given her
            mother a copy of the Wattles book to help her recover from her
            breakdown.
