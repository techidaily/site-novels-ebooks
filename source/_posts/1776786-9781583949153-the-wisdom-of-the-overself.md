          Inspired by Paul Brunton's years spent with sages in Asia,
          <i>The Wisdom of the Overself&nbsp;</i>and its companion
          volume&nbsp;<i>The Hidden Teaching Beyond Yoga </i>were written at the
          request of these remarkable teachers, who recognized that Brunton had
          a significant role to play in the transmission of traditional wisdom
          to the West. Here&nbsp;is a profound re-creation of these teachings,
          brought to life and made accessible by Brunton's insights. In print
          since the 1940s, Brunton's works are considered to be among the most
          comprehensive, clear, and practical guides on the path to
          enlightenment.&nbsp;<br /><br />Brunton unfolds the grand vision for
          human development by investigating consciousness as the source of all
          experience; how to move from ego-centered life to the transcendent
          reality; the interplay of karma, free will, and grace; the nature of
          evil and suffering; how to awaken intuition and penetrative insight;
          the passage through death to rebirth; and psychic experiences and
          mystic visions. He also provides seven ultramystic exercises to open
          the door to higher consciousness, including a healing meditation on
          the sun; practices for transforming the future, dream, and sleep; and
          a meditation on the timeless self. These techniques lead to the
          deepest spiritual realizations—to the true "Wisdom of the
          Overself."<br /><br />This new edition has been updated to incorporate
          Brunton's final revisions. It includes a new foreword plus
          supplementary reading material selected from the author's archives by
          the Paul Brunton Philosophic Foundation.<br /><br />Contents<br />Foreword

          "[Paul Brunton is] a person of rare intelligence ... thoroughly alive,
          and whole in the most significant, 'holy' sense of the word."<br />
          —<i>Yoga Journal</i>&nbsp;<br /><br />“Brunton has penetrated further
          than many others who are writing in his line. He has touched the
          heights of overcoming even meditative mysticism and its achievements,
          as Brunton calls it, in order to arrive at 'philosophy,' by which he
          means the realization that Yoga is means, not ends.… Brunton has
          successfully avoided any conventional or worn out religious
          terminology—even the word 'God' is not used."<br />—<i
            >Review of Religion,</i
          >
          Prof. Frederic Spiegelberg, Stanford University<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “[Dr. Brunton] is an indefatigable and well-balanced expounder of the
          half-forgotten thought of the ancient world, and a stimulating guide
          to those who would be initiated into the Wisdom of the East.”<br />—<i

          &nbsp;<br />
          “Not withstanding the difficulty of the subject presented, it is
          written in a most lucid manner which could be comprehended by
          everyone, even if this is their first book on the higher philosophy.
          Dr. Brunton applies this ancient wisdom to the great philosophical
          problems which have been cause for inquiry throughout the ages. His
          analyses … are masterly.”<br />—<i>Occult Review</i> [London]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Dr. Brunton has made a deep exploration into the metaphysical … and
          has created a work of considerable importance in this present age. The
          author's message is intended to create a transformation in both mind
          and body, a mystical asceticism which transcends all personal
          self-interest.”<br />—<i>The Border Standard</i> [England]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Dr. Brunton emphasizes the mystical nature of grace … it will be
          gratifying to many students and practitioners of spiritual life to
          find it here revived in its own name and proper nature. Dr. Brunton's
          work has now become a full philosophical system of thought, a
          definitely modern teaching, in which the ancient Wisdom is transposed
          for realization by these times.”<br />—<i>The Beacon</i> [New York
          City]<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The book is an interesting and clear statement of orthodox Yoga. The
          virtue of Dr. Brunton's books is their freedom from the usual esoteric
          decoration. The vocabulary, both verbally and ideologically, is modern
          … and his ideas and expressions thought-provoking.”<br />—<i

        </h4>
        <p>
          PAUL BRUNTON (1898-1981) is one of the twentieth century's most
          brilliant spiritual writers. Generally recognized as having introduced
          yoga and meditation to the West, he was the most popular and
          authoritative source of information on Eastern philosophies, gurus,
          and meditation systems from the mid-'30s to the '60s. His books have
          sold over two million copies in 17 languages.&nbsp;In 1954, he
          withdrew from public life and continued writing the material that was
          posthumously published as&nbsp;<i>The Notebooks of Paul Brunton</i>--a
          truly East-West spiritual philosophy. Written with the passion of an
          authentic pioneer and the thoughtfulness of a seasoned practitioner,
          his work is re-emerging as a beacon for all contemporary seekers.
