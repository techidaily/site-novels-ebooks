          <b>Unmasking the mysteries of alien life on earth!</b>
          <p>
            Make mention of the word “alien” and it conjures images of
            black-eyed, large-headed, dwarfish beings that have come to be known
            as the Greys. Indeed, Greys have become a staple part of
            pop-culture, never mind just the field of UFO research. They’ve
            appeared in Steven Spielberg’s classic 1977 movie,
            <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>. They regularly popped up
            in <i>The X-Files</i>. And, of course, there are numerous people –
            all across the world – who claim to have been abducted by the Greys
            and subjected to intrusive medical experiments. Yet, before the
            1950s, the Greys were nowhere in sight.

            shows that extraterrestrial life comes in all kinds, appearances,
            sizes, and bodies. They all have one thing in common, however: the
            human race has encountered them, and we continue to do so today. Not
            just dozens, or even hundreds, but thousands of eyewitness
            experiences have been reported. Covering hundreds of
            extraterrestrial life forms in more than 40 thematic chapters, this
            absorbing look at the mysteries of aliens on earth includes …<br />
            the Space Brothers: long-haired, very human-looking ETs the fiendish
            Reptilians: seven-to-eight-foot-tall predatory shapeshifters Men in
            Black beings: extremely pale-skinned, tall, and with huge eyes
            Black-eyed Children: anemic-looking kids with solid black eyes that
            might be ET-human hybrids Bigfoot the werewolf-like Dogmen
            jellyfish-style aliens that soar around the skies of our world the
            Shadow People: dangerous humanoids that terrorize people legendary
            Nephilim space-vampires: insect-like aliens that resemble a giant
            praying mantis and many, many more!
          </p>
          <p>
            <i><b>The Alien Book</b></i> investigates the full range of
            sentient, alien life forms. Some are benign and others downright
            deadly. Some are small, like a germ or virus that has NASA, creating
            guidelines to deal with an outbreak of an extraterrestrial germ.
            Some are big like a giant praying mantis or the biblical Goliath.
            They all lurk on Earth and in this chilling book!
          </p>
          <p>
            With more than 120 photos and graphics, this tome is richly
            illustrated. Its helpful bibliography and extensive index add to its
            usefulness.
