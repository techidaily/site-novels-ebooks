          <i>Life After Near Death</i> is the only book to explore the deeper
          meaning of the near-death experience (NDE) through the prism of its
          miraculous aftereffects.<br /><br />You don’t need to be declared
          clinically dead to experience an NDE. Nor must you experience many of
          Raymond Moody’s nine elements, including a life review, an out-of-body
          experience, encounters with deceased loved ones, and a decision to
          return to one’s body. The key is whether you return from the
          experience permanently transformed.<br /><br /><i
            >Life After Near Death</i
          >
          profiles a dozen cases of specific cognitive and physiological
          near-death aftereffects, including newfound musical and artistic
          talents, mathematical gifts, enhanced hearing, elevated IQ, improved
          eyesight, spontaneous healing, and electrical sensitivity. It explores
          new evidence to shed light on this phenomenon and reveals for the
          first time:<br /><br />The link between predisposition and the NDE.<br />The
          role of manifestation and intent in the creation of the NDE.<br />The
          unmistakable connections among the energetic world, frequency, and the
          NDE.<br />The circumstances and conditions that give rise to a NDE.<br /><br /><i
            >Life After Near Death</i
          >
          offers a new, science-based paradigm to unravel the NDE and our
          assumptions regarding the afterlife. Although you can return from an
          NDE, you will never return to your former life.
