            Gary’s first words of his introduction to this masterpiece
            are:“Spiritual care means being fully present to the suffering of
            others and meeting them where they are without a whiff of judgment.”
            I Am Here for You is so much more than a collection of weekly
            meditations Chaplain Gary Blaine wrote for his hospital coworkers
            whom he served along with the patients. Although the setting is
            within a small rural hospital, you will find that the story is much
            bigger – about life, relationships, struggles and encouragement that
            apply to all human beings, regardless of occupation, race or stage
            of life. Gary is not afraid to speak bluntly about life’s truths,
            including suffering and death; yet in doing so finds a way of giving
            the listener peace, hope and inspiration. “Pastoral presence is
            honoring the limits of medicine and nursing, confessing the failures
            of people and processes, and absolving all with words of hope and
            forgiveness, abiding presence, and encouragement. … [It] is the
            dignity of bearing with these all too human beings and believing in
            them when all self-confidence has been eroded away.”

          “In I Am Here For You Chaplain Blaine movingly addresses his hospital
          colleagues. He uses humor and gentleness to explain a chaplain's work,
          and he moves his readers past shallow stereotypes, like chaplain
          merely as “calm presence” or “professional mourner.” He outlines how a
          chaplain engages the whole hospital system, but he does much more! The
          beauty and richness of enlivened chaplaincy is demonstrated through
          his weekly notes to staff. He engages his colleagues; he acknowledges
          the oft unacknowledged: the human vulnerability witnessed in a
          hospital is not only that of the patients, but of all who work there.
          Caring for those who suffer highlights the suffering we all face. In
          collectively acknowledging this, we strengthen each other. All are
          ministers in this setting, for “God uses common and ordinary people
          for uncommon and extraordinary blessings." This book, spirited and
          personal, is written for anyone who works in healthcare, regardless of
          role, and for anyone seeking grace in the midst of suffering.”

          “I’ve been graced by reading Gary Blaine’s writings for years. Week
          after week, his sermons contain wisdom, keen observation, compassion,
          and the invaluable ability to find godliness in everyday joys,
          routines, and suffering. In this volume, Gary demonstrates the same
          holy virtues. There are so many good stories, so many profound
          insights, in this collection. But perhaps most of all, there is ample
          evidence that Gary attended, that he was fully present and available
          to the people he served. Gary often closes these reflections with a
          reminder to the staff, “I am here for you.” After reading these
          columns, readers are likely to feel Gary was there for and with them,
          too.”
