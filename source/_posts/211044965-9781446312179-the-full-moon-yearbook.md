            When the full moon rises in the night sky, it's hard not to be
            captivated by the light that streams down on earth from our closest
            celestial neighbour. Even in the modern age, drenched in artificial
            light, the full moon has a magic that speaks to our most primal
            selves. This magic was recognised throughout human history, and
            lives on in the names various cultures have given each full moon as
            it rises above us.<br /><br /><i>The Full Moon Yearbook</i> combines
            Native American culture, Medieval Celtic Culture, East Asian culture
            and Witchcraft to dive into the stories that have led to names like
            February's Budding Moon, or November's Frost Moon. Over thirteen
            chapters, the names and mythology associated with each full moon are
            explored, as well as corresponding crystals, rituals, and yoga
            practices to make engaging with the energy of the full moon natural
            and fun.<br /><br />That thirteenth chapter is dedicated to the Blue
            moon, and in <i>The Full Moon Yearbook</i> readers will discover the
            reason why this mysterious moon appears in our night skies, along
            with its even more elusive friend, the Black Moon.<br /><br />Alongside
            the folk names, <i>The Full Moon Yearbook</i> highlights some of the
            goddesses that have been dedicated to, or personified, the moon in
            ancient religions, bringing their stories to life. With the
            international perspective, lunar festivals and customs from around
            the world and practical makes and recipes to help celebrate the full
            moon are included in this illustrated guide, showing how important
            the full moon has been throughout history to humankind.<br /><br /><i
              >The Full Moon Yearbook</i
            >
            is perfect for anyone who has ever felt a pull towards living in
            harmony with the moon, and longs to be living a lunar-inspired life.
