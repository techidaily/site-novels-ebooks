            >“Illuminates the very heart of social justice and how it might be
            approached and nurtured through mindfulness practices in community
            and through the discernment and new degrees of freedom these
            practices entrain.” --from the foreword by Jon Kabat-Zinn</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />In a society where unconscious bias,
          microaggressions, institutionalized racism, and systemic injustices
          are so deeply ingrained, healing is an ongoing process. When conflict
          and division are everyday realities, our instincts tell us to close
          ranks, to find the safety of those like us, and to blame others. This
          book profoundly shows that in order to have the difficult
          conversations required for working toward racial justice, inner work
          is essential. Through the practice of embodied mindfulness--paying
          attention to our thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations in an
          open, nonjudgmental way--we increase our emotional resilience,
          recognize our own biases, and become less reactive when triggered.<br />&nbsp;<br />As
          Sharon Salzberg,&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author
          of&nbsp;<i>Real Happiness</i>&nbsp;writes, “Rhonda Magee is a
          significant new voice I've wanted to hear for a long time—a voice both
          unabashedly powerful and deeply loving in looking at race and racism.”
          Magee shows that embodied mindfulness calms our fears and helps us to
          exercise self-compassion. These practices help us to slow down and
          reflect on microaggressions--to hold them with some objectivity and
          distance--rather than bury unpleasant experiences so they have a
          cumulative effect over time. Magee helps us develop the capacity to
          address the fears and anxieties that would otherwise lead us to
          re-create patterns of separation and division.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is
          only by healing from injustices and dissolving our personal barriers
          to connection that we develop the ability to view others with
          compassion and to live in community with people of vastly different
          backgrounds and viewpoints. Incorporating mindfulness exercises,
          research, and Magee's hard-won insights,&nbsp;<i
            >The Inner Work of Racial Justice</i
          >&nbsp;offers a road map to a more peaceful world.

          "This book opens doors for all of us to better understand the
          conditioning that keeps us feeling so separate and apart. Rhonda Magee
          is a significant new voice I've wanted to hear for a long time—a voice
          both unabashedly powerful and deeply loving in looking at race and
          racism. Most important, Rhonda's voice is a practical one,
          illuminating a path each of us can follow to a life filled with far
          greater awareness, connection, and peace."<br />

          painful injustice of racism that is so deeply embedded in us?
          Illuminated by her work in meditation and mindfulness practice, Rhonda
          Magee has spent her life considering this question. Her knowledge,
          wisdom, sensitivity, and compassion shine through every page of
          <i>The Inner Work of Racial Justice</i>. This book should be read
          slowly and carefully by everyone. Do its exercises, ponder its

          offers us a path to look into the painful truths of structural racial

          necessary emotional grounding to skillfully work through the pain to
          generate new solutions through authentic connections to more

          Rhonda Magee frames racism as one of the habits of mind that lead
          straight to suffering, then applies the wisdom of mindfulness to
          untangle the knots, compulsions, and delusions that hold this habit in
          place. She shares finely-tuned practices and stories that speak to the

          uneasy truce between races since the civil rights movement, and Magee
          brilliantly facilitates strengthening our will and courage to turn
          toward each other despite our fears. In essence, she puts shoes on our
