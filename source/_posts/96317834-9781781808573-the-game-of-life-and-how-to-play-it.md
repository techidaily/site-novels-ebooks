          Louise L. Hay, whose writings and talks have brought inspiration,
          hope, and healing to millions of people around the world, credits
          <i>The Game of Life</i> (and the entire body of work by Florence
          Scovel Shinn) for inspiring her at a key turning point in her early
          career. <br /><br />Shinn was one of the gifted teachers who
          profoundly shaped the field of personal transformation and spiritual
          growth. Her writings are known for their clarity, simplicity, and
          power. In addition to the original text of the book, included within
          is a new interpretation of this transformational classic, titled
          <i>The Game of Life for Women</i>. This second part of the book speaks
          directly to women about how to own their true power. At the same time,
          however, it speaks to men who wish to not only understand the women
          around them, but also embrace their own power by tapping in to the
          universal principles beneath gender differences. <br /><br />Whether
          male or female, you will likely reach a similar conclusion: It is a
          book for the ages, to be treasured and studied and taken to heart.
