          • Examines the significant figures and groups of Finland’s occult
          world, including their esoteric practices and the secret societies to
          which they were connected <br /><br />• Investigates the relationship
          of nationalism and esotericism in Finland as well as the history of
          Finnish parapsychology and the Finnish UFO craze <br /><br />• Looks
          at the unique evolution of Freemasonry in Finland, showing how, when
          Finland was still part of Russia and the Masonic order was banned,
          adherents created a number of other secret societies
          <br /><br />Finland has long been viewed as the land of sorcerers and
          shamans. Exploring the rich history of Finnish occultism, Perttu
          Häkkinen and Vesa Iitti examine the significant figures and groups of
          Finland’s occult world from the late 19th century to the present day.
          They begin with Pekka Ervast, known as the Rudolf Steiner of the
          North, who was a major figure in Theosophy before starting a
          Rosicrucian group called Ruusu-Risti, and they look at the Finnish
          disciples of G. I. Gurdjieff and the grim case of the cult of
          Tattarisuo. <br /><br />Investigating the relationship of nationalism
          and esotericism in Finland, the authors tell the stories of Sigurd
          Wettenhovi-Aspa, who thought that Finns were the root of all Western
          civilization, and of Yrjö von Grönhagen, who became a close friend of
          Heinrich Himmler and Karl Maria Wiligut. They also explore the history
          of Finnish parapsychology, the Finnish UFO craze, and the unique
          evolution of Freemasonry in Finland, showing how, when the Masonic
          order was banned, adherents created a number of other secret
          societies, such as the Carpenter’s Order, the Hypotenuse Order, and
          the Brotherhood of February 17--which later became hubs for the OTO
          and AMORC. <br /><br />Unveiling both the light and dark sides of
          modern esotericism in Finland, the authors show how, because of its
          unique position as partially European and partially Russian, Finland’s
          occult influence extends into the very heart of left-hand and
          right-hand occult groups and secret societies around the world.

          "The authors of <i>Lightbringers of the North</i> cover a tremendous
          amount of occult Finnish history. They even delve into the background
          of Freemasony there, back when Finland was still part of Russia and
          the Masonic order was banned, causing adherents to create a number of
          secret societies like the Carpenter’s Order, the Hypotenuse Order, and
          the Brotherhood of February 17, including how following Finland’s
          independence from Russia in 1917, lodges began to reappear once again.
          Being heavily into UFO personalities, stories, and groups for well
          over half a century now, I was especially interested in reading about
          Finnish Ufology."
