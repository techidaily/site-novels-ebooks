            >Unleash your inner genius and take your life by storm with this
            supportive guide to fearlessly cultivating your imagination and
            sustaining your creativity<br /></b
          ><br />
          Do you have a nagging suspicion that you're not living up to your
          creative potential? Do you feel hindered by the deeply embedded
          programming of social conformity and core limiting beliefs? Most of
          all, are you ready to shed those shackles and unleash the raging
          genius deep inside? In <i>Awaken Your Genius,</i> author Carolyn
          Elliott helps you do just that with a seven-step course that shows you
          how to live at your fullest creative potential and make manifest your
          deepest desires and dreams.<br /><br />
          In Step 1, Hearing the Heart's Call, you'll learn how to determine
          your true passions and create a vision for yourself at your most fully
          realized best. Step 2, Accepting the Call, helps you turn that vision
          into a commitment. Step 3, Meeting the Guide, opens the door to
          dialoguing with your inner mentor—the subconscious part of yourself
          that knows what's missing and how to get it. Step 4, Crossing the
          Threshold, shows you how to let go of socially programed conformity
          and venture into your own personal imaginative dreamscape. Step 5,
          Enduring Trials, gives you tools and tips on navigating the inevitable
          obstacles that arise when doing this kind of transformational work.
          Step 6, Becoming Divine, shows you how to tune in to your most
          expansive, unconditionally loving self, which in turn gives you the
          power to manifest your dreams and inspire those around you. Step 7,
          Taming Your Genius, shows you how to negotiate with your newfound
          genius—a mighty power to be reckoned with—so that it gets sustenance
          without becoming disruptive. Each step comes with excellent
          explanations of the powers at work, as well as assignments (called
          "experiments") and check-ins to make sure you're keeping up with the
          previous steps.

          “The epoch of the suffering genius is finally at an end—and a new
          culture of enlightened pleasure and personal abundance awaits those
          with the courage to shed old patterns and embrace a new myth. Carolyn
          Elliott's book reverses old stereotypes to propose a path for artists
          and inspired misfits to find joy through their gifts.”<br />—Daniel
          Pinchbeck, author of <i>2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl</i
          ><br /><br />“Reading&nbsp;Awaken Your Genius&nbsp;is like taking
          communion with a bohemian brain set on fire. It’s a great treasure and
          will no doubt become a trendsetter for future spiritual treatises on
          creativity and the arts.”<br />—Adam Elenbaas, founder of Nightlight
          Astrology and author of&nbsp;Fisher of Men<br /><br />"What massive,
          leaden lid keeps your creative genius blocked and locked in your
          habitual mind?&nbsp; This book describes a seven-step journey to
          unleash the outrageous birds and coiled dragons of creativity. It is
          practical—filled with contemplative care for the sensitivity of our
          hearts, and comes from the author’s real experience.
          <i>Awaken Your Genius</i>&nbsp;is fearless in asking us to look at our
          own complicity in hiding from the shocking power of our innate
          brilliance. Our world needs more poetry at the edges of things, and
          this book invites imagination to see that the sleeping giant of
          creativity is already awake." <br />
          —Acharya Adam Lobel M.Div, Harvard Divinity School, Shambhala<br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />"Carolyn Elliott uses humor, wisdom, and poetry to
          guide each of us to our own bright genius. This is a smart, spirited
          book."<br />—Terrance Hayes, author of <i>Lighthead</i> and winner of
          the 2010 National Book Award for Poetry<br /><br />“Carolyn Elliott
          shows us that each one of us has the opportunity to heal, transform,
          and evolve consciousness. <i>Awaken Your Genius</i> overflows with
          soulful, substantive methods for doing just that.”<br />
          —Brian Browne Walker, author and translator of the <i>I Ching,</i>
          <i>Tao te Ching, Hua hu Ching, </i>and <i>Art of War</i
          ><br /><br />“In a voice that might remind you of a spritely Jane
          Austen, Elliott guides her reader on a nimble journey where she
          illuminates with insight, logic, and love the path toward awakening
          your genius. It’s a spiritual quest aided in the romantic ideals of
          truth and beauty, where wisdom and whimsy merge as Elliot guides us on
          the path toward hearing our own heart’s call, revealing in the
          process, the reality of a wisdom-deficient world, while simultaneously
          leading us on the hero’s journey of creativity, innocence and
          love.”<br />
          —Robin Gunkel, writer, regional coordinator for Evolver Baltimore, and
          graduate of the Jack Kerouc School of Disembodied Poetics<br />
