          Reveals the true role of James, the brother of Jesus, in early
          Christianity <br />
          <br />• Uses evidence from the canonical Gospels, apocryphal texts,
          and the writings of the Church Fathers to reveal the teachings of
          Jesus as transmitted to his chosen successor: James <br />
          <br />• Demonstrates how the core message in the teachings of Jesus is
          an expansion not a repudiation of the Jewish religion <br />
          <br />• Shows how James can serve as a bridge between Christianity,
          Judaism, and Islam <br />
          <br />James has been a subject of controversy since the founding of
          the Church. Evidence that Jesus had siblings contradicts Church dogma
          on the virgin birth, and James is also a symbol of Christian teachings
          that have been obscured. While Peter is traditionally thought of as
          the leader of the apostles and the “rock” on which Jesus built his
          church, Jeffrey Bütz shows that it was James who led the disciples
          after the crucifixion. It was James, not Peter, who guided them
          through the Church's first major theological crisis--Paul's
          interpretation of the teachings of Jesus. <br />
          <br />Using the canonical Gospels, writings of the Church Fathers, and
          apocryphal texts, Bütz argues that James is the most overlooked figure
          in the history of the Church. He shows how the core teachings of Jesus
          are firmly rooted in Hebraic tradition; reveals the bitter battles
          between James and Paul for ideological supremacy in the early Church;
          and explains how Paul's interpretations, which became the foundation
          of the Church, are in many ways its betrayal. Bütz reveals a picture
          of Christianity and the true meaning of Christ's message that are
          sometimes at odds with established Christian doctrine and concludes
          that James can serve as a desperately needed missing link between
          Christianity, Judaism, and Islam to heal the wounds of centuries of
          enmity.
