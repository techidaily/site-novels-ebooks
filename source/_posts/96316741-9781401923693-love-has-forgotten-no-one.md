            >From the best-selling author of
            <i>the Disappearance of the Universe</i> and
            <i>Your Immortal Reality</i></b
          ><br /><br />In this fascinating book, Gary R. Renard and his Ascended
          Master teachers, Arten and Pursah, guide you through a way of
          dissolving the illusions of time and space and returning to Reality,
          which is Perfect Love. This is not love in the way the world commonly
          thinks of it. It's an all-encompassing kind of love that is perfect
          spirit: innocent, unflawed, immortal, invulnerable, and forever
          fearless.<br /><br />Real love, which is Divine in nature, must be
          experienced, for it is beyond words. Yet words and practice are needed
          to help lead you to that experience. The knowledge of what it's like
          to be one with your Source is the awesome mystical experience that's
          been described by Masters throughout the ages. It's the greatest sense
          of awareness anyone can have while still appearing to be in this
          world. This book will teach you exactly how to get to that experience,
          which upon the end of your physical existence will become your
          permanent reality. You will find that, indeed, love has forgotten no
          one.

          “No, I won’t give away any details here and spoil your reading fun. As
          with the earlier books, it’s not even those little personal details
          that make it an exciting read. They are just glitter. So, if not for
          the news items, why are we eager for more? The truth, for his growing
          body of steady readers, is that Gary has agreed to share his life with
          us, warts and all, and enables us to learn&nbsp;<i
            >A Course in Miracles</i
          >&nbsp;with him, in a fun and intense way, always going deeper and
          deeper into its experiential implications. The comedy of his life
          invites us to increasingly realize what the Course is actually
          saying.”<br /><b>— Rogier Fentener van Vlissingen</b>, author

            >Love Has Forgotten No One</i
          >&nbsp;is not really a book—rather, it’s a portal, a transport system,
          a rearranging of the mind. When you’ve finished reading it, I believe
          you’ll be closer to knowing your True Nature. All that, and Gary’s
          funny, too!”<br /><b>— H. Ronald Hulnick, Ph.D.</b>, President,

        </h4>
        <p>
          In the early 1990s, Gary R. Renard underwent a powerful spiritual
          awakening. As instructed, he slowly and carefully wrote his first
          book, The Disappearance of the Universe, over a period of nine years.
          Gary has been described as one of the most interesting and courageous
          spiritual speakers in the world. Over the past several years, he has
          lectured throughout the U.S., Canada, Australia, England, and Costa
          Rica; and was the keynote speaker at the International A Course in
          Miracles Conference in Salt Lake City in 2005. He is also the author
          of Your Immortal Reality.
