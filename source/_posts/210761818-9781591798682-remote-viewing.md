            We typically think of psychics as "special" or "gifted" with unusual
            abilities. But David Morehouse teaches that all human beings,
            including you, have the inborn capacity for Remote Viewing—the
            ability to see across space and time.<br /><br />With&nbsp;<i
              >Remote Viewing: The Complete User's Manual for Coordinate Remote
              Viewing</i
            >,&nbsp;he presents comprehensive instruction in this scientifically
            designed method for tapping your ability to transcend your physical
            senses. By adapting the training he underwent to become an elite
            "psychic spy," Morehouse has created an accessible step–by–step
            approach that anyone can use.<br /><br />"Remote Viewing was created
            as a means of gathering information," teaches David Morehouse, "but
            it has proven to be much more." As thousands of his students have
            discovered, a Remote Viewer actually taps into the collective
            unconscious that connects everything and everyone in the
            universe.<br /><br />Presented in an accessible, logical, and artful
            manner, here is an unprecedented training manual for learning this
            profoundly transformational practice, and taking the first step into
            your ultimate potential. Includes a link to a downloadable 77–minute
            brainwave entrainment track.

          <b>David Morehouse</b><br />Born into a family of career officers,
          David Morehouse for nearly 20 years steadied himself on an unwavering
          track of becoming a general in the United States Army. Then, in 1987,
          a machine gun bullet hit him and, by all accounts, should have killed
          him instantly. Instead, this experience opened his perception to a new
          reality, and a new understanding of personal and collective purpose.
          In his international bestseller <i>Psychic Warrior</i>, he recounts
          how he was recruited into a top-secret program of the CIA and trained
          as a Remote Viewer, capable of seeing persons, places, and things
          distant in space-time to gather information. Today David Morehouse has
          transformed these techniques into a tool for personal empowerment,
          enhanced insight, intuitive development, and discernment. Now, in a
          landmark event, he has created his first practical course in this
          amazing method: <i>The Remote Viewing Training Course</i>.
