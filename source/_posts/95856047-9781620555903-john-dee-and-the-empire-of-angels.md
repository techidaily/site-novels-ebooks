          A comprehensive look at the life and continuing influence of
          16th-century scientific genius and occultist Dr. John Dee
          <br /><br />• Presents an overview of Dee’s scientific achievements,
          intelligence and spy work, imperial strategizing, and his work
          developing methods to communicate with angels <br /><br />• Pieces
          together Dee’s fragmentary Spirit Diaries and examines Enochian in
          precise detail and the angels’ plan to establish a New World Order
          <br /><br />• Explores Dee’s influence on Sir Francis Bacon, modern
          science, Rosicrucianism, and 20th-century occultists such as Jack
          Parsons, Aleister Crowley, and Anton LaVey <br /><br />Dr. John Dee
          (1527-1608), Queen Elizabeth I’s court advisor and astrologer, was the
          foremost scientific genius of the 16th century. Laying the foundation
          for modern science, he actively promoted mathematics and astronomy as
          well as made advances in navigation and optics that helped elevate
          England to the foremost imperial power in the world. Centuries ahead
          of his time, his theoretical work included the concept of light speed
          and prototypes for telescopes and solar panels. Dee, the original
          “007” (his crown-given moniker), even invented the idea of a “British
          Empire,” envisioning fledgling America as the new Atlantis, himself as
          Merlin, and Elizabeth as Arthur. <br /><br />But, as Jason Louv
          explains, Dee was suppressed from mainstream history because he spent
          the second half of his career developing a method for contacting
          angels. After a brilliant ascent from star student at Cambridge to
          scientific advisor to the Queen, Dee, with the help of a disreputable,
          criminal psychic named Edward Kelley, devoted ten years to communing
          with the angels and archangels of God. These spirit communications
          gave him the keys to Enochian, the language that mankind spoke before
          the fall from Eden. Piecing together Dee’s fragmentary Spirit Diaries
          and scrying sessions, the author examines Enochian in precise detail
          and explains how the angels used Dee and Kelley as agents to establish
          a New World Order that they hoped would unify all monotheistic
          religions and eventually dominate the entire globe.
          <br /><br />Presenting a comprehensive overview of Dee’s life and
          work, Louv examines his scientific achievements, intelligence and spy
          work, imperial strategizing, and Enochian magick, establishing a
          psychohistory of John Dee as a singular force and fundamental driver
          of Western history. Exploring Dee’s influence on Sir Francis Bacon,
          the development of modern science, 17th-century Rosicrucianism, the
          19th-century occult revival, and 20th-century occultists such as Jack
          Parsons, Aleister Crowley, and Anton LaVey, Louv shows how John Dee
          continues to impact science and the occult to this day.

          “The Dee story is among the most mystifying and important in the
          entire history of the Western esoteric tradition. And here, Jason Louv
          has given us the most complete, complex, and balanced account yet of
          Dee and his aftermath. An awesome achievement.”
