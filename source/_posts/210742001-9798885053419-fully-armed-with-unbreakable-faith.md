            Fully Armed with Unbreakable Faith is the true story of the
            spiritual awakening and the life path journey of Jo Allison, who is
            no one famous and is not well-known for anything other than being a
            pleasant and friendly person to most people who meet her. Her story,
            however, is very unusual and unique and at times very scary and
            life-threatening. Jo has spent most of her life trying to figure out
            her place in the world. She made choices in her life that led her
            down this wild and crazy life journey. After many nightmares,
            feeling like she was being possessed by a demon, and thought she was
            going crazy, Jo discovered the full armor of God. Her faith became
            very strong and soon was unbreakable. In her story, Jo shares all of
            her life experiences, some happy but some of them very dark,
            heartbreaking, and sad. However, it doesn't matter what the
            situation is; Jo can see and feel the light, and when a dark
            situation is lit up, she receives understanding and then miracles
            and signs from God, angels, the divine, and the universe. In 2020,
            Jo received major spiritual clarity and discovered a few hidden
            talents she received from God. Jo also discovered she was
            specifically chosen to reveal and share many spiritual truths she
            received through visions, dreams, and spiritual communication from
            God, Jesus, and angels of the highest good. Jo's intention for the
            book is to inspire others and put love, hope, and unbreakable faith
            back into the hearts of all human beings and to help heal the world.
            However, she does reveal some truths that will be hard for some to
            accept, but God wants this story told and everyone to be enlightened
            and informed. This book is a guide and a key that will unlock a door
            to anyone who reads it from front to back cover. Once you're
            enlightened and have gained understanding, you can go through the
            door. Once you get through the door, you'll be ready to level up
            into your next journey on your life path leading to your destiny.
