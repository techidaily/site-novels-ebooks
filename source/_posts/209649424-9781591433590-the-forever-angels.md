          A groundbreaking study of the lifelong effects of near-death
          experiences in the newly born, babies, toddlers, and children up to
          age five <br /><br />• Draws on interviews with nearly 400 childhood
          experiencers, both fully matured and young, as well as more than 40
          years of NDE research involving over 5,000 people <br /><br />•
          Reveals how those who experience a near-death state at a young age are
          profoundly affected for the rest of their lives, including developing
          psychic and intuitive abilities, “wisdom beyond their years,” and a
          pervasive feeling of being “homesick for heaven” <br /><br />•
          Investigates the wide-awake consciousness of babies being born, womb
          memories, and the experience of being alive on the other side of death
          <br /><br />In this major study of near-death experiences with the
          newly born, babies, toddlers, and children up to age five, NDE expert
          P. M. H. Atwater reveals how those who experience a near-death state
          or other worlds at a very young age are profoundly affected for the
          rest of their lives, including developing psychic and intuitive
          abilities, higher intelligence and “wisdom beyond their years,” and a
          pervasive feeling of being “homesick for heaven.” <br /><br />Drawing
          on interviews with nearly 400 childhood experiencers, both fully
          matured and young, Atwater explores their accounts of what it is like
          to be alive on the other side of death as well as what makes them
          different from others, complemented by a deep analysis of statistical
          evidence from her more than 40 years of NDE research involving more
          than 5,000 people. She shows how, in contrast to adult experiencers,
          child and infant experiencers of near-death states cannot compare
          “before” with “after” as adults do, because they don’t have a
          “before.” The world of these “forever angels” is the life continuum, a
          stream of consciousness that has always existed and always will.
          Integrating “where they once were” with “where they now are” is a
          lifelong challenge. The author explores how those who have a
          near-death experience very early in life, or even in utero, grow up
          “different”--sometimes geniuses, sometimes lost, yet unusually psychic
          and smart, all at the same time. She reveals how these experiences and
          their knowledge of the afterlife affect the individual in many areas,
          including family life, dating, health, education, and spirituality, as
          well as increasing the experiencer’s potential for thoughts of
          suicide, out-of-body experiences, and PTSD symptoms.
          <br /><br />Examining the forever angels’ memories of the womb, birth,
          early childhood, and the other world, Atwater investigates the
          wide-awake consciousness of babies being born, the vivid recall of
          mature childhood near-death experiencers, and how memory of the
          life-continuum never fades, nor does the desire to go back.

          “In her truly groundbreaking book, P. M. H. Atwater has boldly gone
          where no researcher has dared to go before--into the lives of the
          newly born who have had NDEs. And what she has found gives us an
          important new way to view NDEs--for these children, it isn’t what we
          thought. P. M. H. Atwater is the field’s most creative and tireless
          researcher! This is a helluva book.” Kenneth Ring, Ph.D., author of
