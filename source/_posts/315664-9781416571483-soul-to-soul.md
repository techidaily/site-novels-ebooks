          <b>In <i>Soul to Soul</i></b
          >, Gary Zukav, author of the monumental bestseller
          <i>The Seat of the Soul</i>, addresses some of the most significant
          questions about the human experience -- from "Why is life so
          difficult?" to "How can I learn to trust?" -- with profound answers
          that are of truly universal value. <br />
          <br />
          With the publication of his revolutionary work
          <i>The Seat of the Soul</i>, Zukav emerged as an important leader in
          the world of spiritual development, and it became one of the all-time
          successful books of its kind. Each of Zukav's subsequent books, all of
          them bestsellers in their own right, has explored different aspects of
          that seminal work, offering detailed explanations and practical
          applications of his original vision. <br />
          <br />
          <i>Soul to Soul</i> represents a giant step forward in the expression
          of his work, providing penetrating insights that illuminate our lives.
          It is divided into two sections. Part One, "Soul Subjects," consists
          of fifty brief, perceptive, and compelling chapters that encourage us
          to examine our own experiences in new and perhaps life-changing ways.
          Part Two, "Soul Questions," is different from anything Zukav has
          written before. Combining profound spiritual and psychological
          insights, Zukav answers nearly one hundred important questions about
          life. Each chapter ends with a challenge to readers to experiment with
          the insight that has been given and make it their own. "Soul
          Questions," which spans the full range of Zukav's vision, asks: Do we
          have a destiny? Can you prove that life exists after death? What is
          the meaning of dreams? How can I love without fear? What is the role
          of soul in my life? How does a person know what he was put on Earth to
          do? How can I forgive someone who betrays me again and again? How can
          I really change? Does the Universe care about us? <br />
          <br />
          <i>Soul to Soul</i> is profoundly simple, wise, and poetic, a book to
          treasure and return to again and again for guidance and inspiration.
