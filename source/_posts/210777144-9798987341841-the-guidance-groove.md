          <p>
            There's a voice inside you that knows exactly what to do when it's
            time to make a choice. Every single time. That is your authenticity,
            your truth, your spark, your own personal Guidance Groove.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            You can find your voice, trust it, and live by it. You can escape
            the untrue thought patterns that obscure your voice, breed
            inauthenticity, and feed your Unproductive Grooves of inadequacy,
            obligation, scarcity, and unworthiness.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The Guidance Groove is a roadmap for navigating the flow of life
            while in continual communication with your own authentic, intuitive
            self. It's an invitation to live your life from a place of
            wholeness.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The Guidance Groove is for those of you who are used to relying
            mostly on logic and the mental stories you have accumulated over
            years of personal, familial, and societal programming when making
            decisions. You believe the thoughts in your head, no matter how
            untrue, and this leads to a life of inauthenticity, dissatisfaction,
            and unease. Despite this, you intuitively feel and know there is
            that true voice inside you, there is a different and more authentic
            way for living that goes beyond your reliance solely on the rational
            realm.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guidance Groove shows you how to recognize when you are stuck in
            the false mental programming that feeds and drives your adherence to
            the Unproductive Grooves. The book examines what it means to be
            trapped in those Unproductive Grooves across multiple life arenas
            (intimate partnerships, family, friends, school/work/life, and
            community), how to escape from the automatic thinking that
            perpetuates the Unproductive Grooves, and how to find, value, and
            listen to your own personal guidance.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In this way, you can approach all choices from a place of wholeness,
            wherein your logical thinking self is fully integrated with your
            intuitive, feeling body. When you release your beliefs in false
            stories and become firmly rooted in your personal Guidance Groove,
            you then navigate the flow of life from a position of authenticity
            and clarity which naturally increases your ease, contentment, and
            joy.&nbsp;
          </p>

          The Guidance Groove is an amazing book. I usually don't like reading a
          lot, but I found myself very into this book. It is very clear,
          concise, and inspiring. I love all the stories in it, and it helped me
          a lot in learning how to make better life decisions that align with my
          authentic self.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          I learned so much about myself, my relationships with others, things
          that are setting me back in life, things that I should be proud of -
          all through this book. The book by Dr. Kurle is a beautiful guide to
          inner peace, love, happiness, and authenticity. Dr. Kurle gives us
          insight on what it means to be authentic and follow your guidance and
          listen to your intuition. Such an amazing experience with lessons that
          I'll never forget.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          I thought that book was very insightful. I believe as science majors
          we sometimes are so focused on being analytical or using abstract
          reasoning we forget to take care of our emotions and needs outside of
          school, work and extracurriculars.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          This seminar helped show me and the other students that some of our
          struggles are shared. That you are not alone in your thoughts of
          inadequacy, or the only person preoccupied with scarcity. I believe
          this book helps you ground yourself and has taught me some principles
          and concrete methods to tackle some of my unproductive grooves or
          habits that I may have fallen into.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          I believe this book will help those who read it reach a more centered
          and happy head space. This book and seminar have helped a lot of us
          students share and learn from each other. I believe this seminar and
          book also helped us students better understand our true desires and to
          better understand the false stories we tell ourselves. Through this
          sharing and recognition of commonalities among the students combined
          with the guidance of the text and Dr. Kurle, I found the book and
          seminar to be therapeutic and motivating.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the book was a great read, nothing was too complicated or
          confusing to understand and I really liked it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          Dr. Kurle has a gift of connecting with her students on such a deep
          level and presents her material in such a beautiful way. I see her as
          a friend and guide. I've learned so much about life and mindset
          through this class - she explains everything so well and clear.
