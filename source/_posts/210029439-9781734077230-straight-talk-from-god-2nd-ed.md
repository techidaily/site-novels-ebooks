          <p>
            <strong>Straight Talk from God</strong>&nbsp;is the culmination of
            one woman's journey from victim to healer, from doubter to believer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kneeling in church one Sunday in 1991, uttering a desperate plea to
            a God she had little faith in, <strong>Bonnie Hassan, MSW</strong>,
            felt the power of Divine intervention wash over her and a few short
            hours later her prayer was answered in an astonishing way. That
            experience was the beginning of a journey facilitated through
            <strong>Reiki&nbsp;</strong>(a Japanese technique for stress
            reduction, relaxation and healing) that led Bonnie to a personal
            relationship with God and the opening of a healing practice in
            Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 2003.
          </p>
          <p>
            As her connection to the Divine continued to grow, and her intuitive
            gifts surfaced, Bonnie began to hear a "<strong>God Voice</strong>"
            in her head guiding her to pick up a pen and channel written
            messages for those in attendance at her group Reiki sessions. One
            evening, as she facilitated a group healing session in her office,
            Bonnie felt a strange sensation at the back of her throat, as if
            something was trying to escape. Hearing her God Voice say, "Just
            open your mouth," Bonnie did so, and a message from the Divine
            spilled from her lips in a spontaneous outpouring for those in
            attendance.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            God has continued to speak through Bonnie to this day, during group
            healing sessions and the classes she teaches. She has accumulated
            hundreds of channeled messages that offer guidance and direction for
            all those on a spiritual path, all those longing for their own
            intimate connection to a Higher Power and the ability to be
            empowered themselves. As her own connection to the Divine has grown,
            her intuitive gifts as a medium, channel and psychic have continued
            to expand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>365 offerings</strong> in this book were chosen
            specifically by the Divine to provide gentle, loving encouragement
            in a direct and timely manner,
            <strong>Straight Talk from God</strong>, if you
            will,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to touch your heart and open your mind
            to a deeper, more intimate and personal connection with the Creator.
            As you immerse yourself in this Divine wisdom, your spiritual
            journey will be transformed, and your relationship with God will
            become the greatest guiding force in your life.

            As one reader stated: "This book opens a pathway to God that most of
            us have been taught doesn't exist. The messages in this book wrap
            you up in love."
