            Psychology is all about relationships, with ourselves and other
            people. Astrology gives us a code to learn the raw materials that we
            and other people are made of so we can better understand the
            dynamics that play out in our lives and relationships.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <br /><strong>Psychstrology</strong>, or psychological astrology,
            can help us cultivate more compassion for ourselves and others,
            which can lead to extraordinary shifts. Jung appreciated astrology
            because the signs, or archetypes, point to the inextricable
            connection between us as a collective whole. Besides helping us
            develop more empathy, being aware of our interconnectedness is
            especially important during these divided and uncertain times.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br />This book will empower you to:</p>
          cultivate deeper self-compassion.identify the benefits and challenges
          of your astrological nature.use synchronicity to align with your true
          self and the next right step.enhance your closest relationships.grow
          in the direction of balance and wholeness.

          “<strong>Psychstrology</strong> is a unique guide to integrating
          psychology and astrology. Dr. Stacy Dicker clearly elucidates how the
          archetypes of astrology can support clinicians and clients alike in
          broadening their understanding of the dynamics of relationships,
          whether between parents, partners, families, or coworkers. She
          includes excellent examples of the synchronicities that led her to
          realize the universal applicability of this ancient archetypal system.
          The book also discusses some of the major life cycles defined by
          astrology, such as the Saturn return. Dr. Dicker lays out an easily
          accessible use of the Sun, Moon, and rising signs as a method to
          unlock the wisdom available to those interested in increasing their
          therapy tools. Helpful charts are included for the reader to explore
          their primary astrological archetypes and those of others. As an
          astrologer, I highly commend her work, which creates a much-needed
          bridge between the field of psychotherapy and the ancient practice of
          astrological counsel.”

          “Dr. Stacy Dicker explores two complex disciplines, &nbsp;psychology
          and astrology, in a way that makes them approachable and relevant for
          everyone, then brings the two together in perfect harmony.
          Interweaving her personal journey throughout makes this read all the
          more compelling. Stacy has bridged a gap that has been too wide for
          too long, and lets the reader get to know her along the way. Her
          courage will serve all seekers in unfolding self-awareness and joy.”

          “Brilliant, lucidly written, and intimate in tone,
          <strong>Psychstrology </strong>is an extraordinary integration of
          healing wisdom from a variety of traditions. It is practical,
          educational, easy to use, and immensely valuable to those offering
          healing as well as those seeking it. Anyone can benefit from this
          gem.”

          “In<strong> Psychstrology</strong>, Dr. Stacy Dicker offers an
          intuitively appealing framework to describe individual personality
          traits and patterns and interpersonal interaction patterns that
          invites the reader to scrutinize and even challenge what they believe
          about themselves and why they act the way they do, especially with
          significant others. Dr. Dicker presents her approach to using zodiac
          signs with sufficient recognition of the broader context of the many
          variables that impact a person’s behavior that the reader is not
          required to assign specific validity to particular statements or
          predictions. Rather, the reader can simply choose to use her approach
          as an intriguing opportunity to consider the possibility that they may
          have overlooked some important aspects of themselves or others, and to
          treat themselves and others more compassionately. The book provides a
          rich vocabulary to talk about needs, wants, fears, and motivations,
          which can help the reader consider how they may live with greater ease
          within themselves, understand the patterns they recognize, and grow
          through consideration of their shadow selves.”
