          have co-created much Magic with her and the nature spirits through the
          Guardian Gateway Telesummits. I really enjoyed reading

          portal into accessing the wisdom of the ethereal and celestial
          kingdoms. Read this beautiful guide with an open heart and a pen and
          paper at hand, as you'll want to enjoy the many explorative journeys
          along the way!<br />

          Healing®&nbsp;<br /><br />Empowering and beautifully written with
          practical advice, meditations, and visualizations to support you on
          your spiritual path. Kim's knowledge and loving desire to assist us
          all in achieving our highest and best in life radiates through each
