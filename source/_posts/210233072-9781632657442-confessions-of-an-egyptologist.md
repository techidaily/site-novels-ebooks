            old kings under one of the pyramids of Saqqara.</b
          ><br /><br />
          In this book, Erich von Däniken shares the story of his friend Adel
          H., an Egyptologist, who, as a 16-year-old boy, was trapped for days
          under the Step Pyramid of Saqqara. Based on his conversations with
          Adel H., he retells the boy’s search for a way out of the underground
          world, how the boy roamed passageways and chambers and saw what he
          calls “impossible” things of which the professional world is
          completely unaware. Adel experienced uncanny events, a mixture of
          spirit realm and reality, which is described here for the first time.
          “The story of Egypt,” Adel says, “has two sides—the official one and
          the unknown one.”<br /><br />
          It is secrets like the sights and events Adel experiences underground
          that von Däniken refers to throughout this book. Von Däniken shows
          that the Great Pyramid of Giza is nothing but a huge library created
          for the people of the future. He proves his claim through quotes from
          the few ancient works that still survive. Who actually had an interest
          for millennia in destroying knowledge/books? It’s not about a few
          thousand, but about millions of books. Von Däniken documents the
          fanatical destructive rage of the people and means: If we would only
          have one ten-thousandth of the former writings, human prehistory would
          have to be completely rewritten.<br /><br />
          And where are the lost labyrinths? The one of Crete and the gigantic
          labyrinth of Egypt, of which all ancient historians reported?<br /><br />
          Against the background of these revelations, von Däniken turns the
          spot on to another focus of his book. A paradigm shift in the question
          of extraterrestrial life: “The gods have already come back. They came
          down again. They are currently orbiting our planet!”

          languages and have sold more than 65 million copies. Several have also
          been made into films. Von Däniken’s ideas have been the inspiration
          for a wide range of television series, including History’s hit
          <i>Ancient Aliens</i>. His research organization, the
          A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com (Archaeology, Astronautics &amp; SETI
