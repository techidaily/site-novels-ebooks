            >This is an informative book for anyone that is curious about
            experiencing a Past Life regression. There are many books on Past
            Life experiences but this is the only book that I know of that takes
            the inquisitive reader through the actual step by step processes.
            The author has made points to assuage the natural fears of the
            unknown by expelling the mystery of the therapy by bringing
            spiritual concepts down to practical applications. As a Past Life
            therapist myself, I highly recommend the reading of this book to
            anyone that has had a desire to experience a past life session but
            have held back due to fears." </span

            >"You probably have noticed there are certain issues that keep
            popping up in your life and wonder why you can't seem to stop
            attracting them. They actually go back many lifetimes and sometimes
            a little help bringing them to the surface is all that it takes to
            make them disappear. Along the way, you'll recognize key
            observations about your soul type that will bring clarity to you and
            life's bigger picture. I learned one thing major detail that would
            have been worth the entire book, but there are many. A wonderful
            book for your library and for soul expansion." </span
