            Within you is a greater, wiser self that is not bound by your fears,
            worries, or perceived limitations. Dr. José Luis Stevens calls this
            the Inner Shaman—the part of you that connects directly to the true
            source of the universe. "The shamans of every tradition know that
            the physical world we can see and touch is a mere shadow of the true
            spirit world," writes Dr. Stevens. With Awaken the Inner Shaman, he
            presents a direct and practical guide for opening our eyes to the
            greater wisdom and knowing within—and stepping into the power and
            responsibility we possess to shape and serve our world. In this
            rousing and provocative book, he invites readers to discover:<br />What
            is the Inner Shaman? How an understanding of our deeper spiritual
            potential shows up in every mystical and scientific tradition.Seeing
            through the heart—why the heart offers us the most immediate path
            for accessing the Inner ShamanIlluminating the Inner Shaman through
            spirituality, quantum physics, medical science, and experiential
            knowingThe Inner Shaman in action—how to stop living from the egoic
            mind and put your true essence in chargeEight tools to strengthen
            your connection to the Inner Shaman, and much more<br />Humanity has
            become enthralled by the Siren’s song of technological progress,
            which has lured us away from the spiritual source that truly
            sustains us. In Awaken the Inner Shaman, Dr. José Stevens challenges
            us to reclaim our lost power to heal, see truly, and fulfill our
            purpose in life. As Dr. Stevens writes: "The Inner Shaman,
            suppressed and ignored for centuries, can be discovered in the most
            obvious place possible—within your own heart."
