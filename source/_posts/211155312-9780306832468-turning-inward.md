            >“Ross shows us that meditation doesn’t have to mean sitting still.
            You can turn within to find inspiration and guidance, even when you
            are dancing.”—Misty Copeland, principal dancer at American Ballet
            Theatre, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author</b
          ><br /><br />
          Lead Instructor of Yoga and Meditation for Peloton Ross Rayburn offers
          a new and accessible take on mindfulness and the art of meditation
          through the practice of introversion, which is a method of
          self-exploration for finding authenticity, joy, and calm in our
          hectic, extroverted world.​ As <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author Robin Arzon says,
          <i
            >“Turning Inward provides the tools to befriend yourself. In sharing
            his mindfulness TIPs, Ross provides a path for even the most novice
            meditator. Herein lies many entry points back to oneself.” </i
          ><br /><br />
          Building off his popular Peloton meditation and yoga classes and his
          years of teaching and spiritual study, Ross Rayburn offers a new way
          to look at meditation. Rather than a purely esoteric practice,
          meditation is, Ross argues, simply “turning in,” which anyone can
          learn how to do through the practice of introversion. Billy Porter,
          award-winning actor, singer, director, composer, and playwright,
          commented,
          <i
            >“Ross Rayburn is one of those rare people who understands how to
            help us access our inner depths. I’m proud to call him both my
            teacher and my friend.”</i
          ><br />
          Because we spend most of our time “turned outward” in order to
          function in society, introversion offers both a respite and a source
          of insight. The practice of introversion leads to a happier, calmer
          life and a truer sense of yourself and your path—something many crave
          in our chaotic and often polarized world.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          With the easy and enjoyable techniques in this book, and a
          surprisingly simple and straightforward way of thinking and seeing,
          you can begin introverting with more intention and with more structure
          and regularity, for even greater benefits. You’ll learn how to handle
          life’s difficulties with less anxiety and greater perspective, and
          you’ll have the tools to remember who you really are, especially
          during those times it’s easiest to forget.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Through these practical exercises, guided visualizations,
          opportunities for contemplation, breathing techniques, and more, you
          will discover that everything you need to be is already who you are.
          It’s inside you. All you have to do is turn inward to find it.
