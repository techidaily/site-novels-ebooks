          adult life consulting; reflecting; and guiding people to view the
          interrelationship between the psycho-spiritual landscape of their
          minds and the way they think, feel, and respond to life. She has now
          provided a means for you to discover the opposing aspects of your mind
          and a mechanism to create meaningful dialogue—with powerful and
          profound healing and integration as the result.“ Tenzin Gyatso, the
          14th Dalai Lama, is quoted as saying, ‘Dialogue is the most effective
          way of resolving conflict.’ Through this book, you’re now able to
          begin the inner journey, find yourself in your most important interior
          landscapes, and learn to dialogue with both the shadow and wisdom
          within you. Discover the magic, mystery,and miracles of your life.
          Remember, the beauty and power of yoursoul is revealed the moment you
          decide to reclaim your power.”<br /><b>Dr. Darren R. Weissman</b>,
          developer of The LifeLine Technique™; best-selling author of

          book teaches you to shift into a new magical awareness of your life;
          you’ll find a deeper understanding of where you are, where you’ve
          been, what you’ve learned, and the path forward that is your destiny.
          We all travel through light and dark; this book helps illuminate the
          way forward so you can transform your story and claim your authentic
          and best life now.”<br /><b>Debbie Ford</b>, #1
