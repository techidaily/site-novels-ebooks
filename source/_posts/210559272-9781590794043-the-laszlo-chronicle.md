          This study analyses the fifty year evolution of Ervin Laszlo's
          contribution to science and philosophy. It records the major turning
          points in his thinking and discusses who and what influenced this
          evolution and with what result.<br /><br />
          Laszlo's search for answers to questions such as man's relationship to
          nature and the cosmos, and the nature of underlying factors of
          evolution which connect all things were not satisfied by working only
          on the basis of the General Evolutionary Systems Theory. Wittgenstein
          said "In every serious philosophical question uncertainty extends to
          the very roots of the problem. We must always be prepared to learn
          something totally new." Laszlo did discover something entirely new –
          the theory of the information field – after immersing himself in a
          range of areas of study such as cosmology, consciousness studies,
          quantum physics, metaphysics and various Eastern traditions. The
          integration of his earlier works with his more recent studies lies
          behind his explanation of the existence of the Akashic Field.<br /><br />
          The Akashic Field is a term that refers to an interactive universe
          communicating in a subtle manner, which connects everything with every
          other thing everywhere. This is a pure information field where
          communication takes place without the need for the transportation of
          physical energy; thus interaction can occur instantaneously regardless
          of distance and time. Coherence and consciousness are the bases of
          Laszlo's Akashic field. He proposed a 'system theoretic paradigm',
          which focuses on a general understanding of the cosmos and the
          implications for entities such as human beings. This entails the
          observation and explanation of human and cosmic evolution as viewed in
          unity or inter-connectedness where macro and micro are essentially
          interlinked. Laszlo's philosophical work extends to sociology when
          describing concurrent worldwide issues closely related to the
          existence of the Akashic Field. His humanist ideals are evidenced by
          his efforts to help humans understand the context and causes for their
          recent challenges and the possibilities that may lie ahead. Ervin
          Laszlo's half-century of exceptional philosophical work gives us the
          most coherent picture of the nature of the world to date.
