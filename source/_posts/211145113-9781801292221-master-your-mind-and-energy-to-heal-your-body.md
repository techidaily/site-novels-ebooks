              >A captivating must-read, this book unveils the astounding hidden
              power of the human mind. If you are working on self-healing, or if
              you have been struggling for years with your own recovery, then
              you will not want to miss this book.</b
            ><br /><br />After an unexpected event, Brandy Gillmore found
            herself disabled and desperately searching for answers to heal. She
            tried every healing approach she could find, including special
            diets, supplements, meditation, and everything in between, but to no
            avail. It wasn't until Brandy delved deeper into the workings of the
            mind that she discovered obscure research that helped her unlock the
            mystery of the body's innate healing ability, resulting in her full
            recovery and a profound transformation in her life.<br /><br />Since
            uncovering these remarkable findings, Brandy has gained recognition
            for helping others heal themselves, even from extreme illness. She
            has also demonstrated how to alleviate chronic pain within minutes
            and documented these results using medical thermal imaging
            equipment.<br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, you will...<br />·
            Gain a revolutionary understanding of the body's ability to heal
            itself<br />· Learn the key factors to activate healing (the 5
            Factors for GIFT Mind-Body Healing™)<br />· Implement a
            step-by-step process with powerful tools and techniques that can
            help you heal and free yourself from mental, emotional, and physical
            pain<br /><br />Brandy's journey from having a debilitating
            incurable condition to complete recovery is more than inspirational;
            it can be seen as a blueprint for anyone facing seemingly
            insurmountable health challenges.<br /><br />Throughout history, for
            thousands of years, spiritual teachings have documented the mind's
            remarkable ability to heal. Furthermore, there is medically
            documented proof that our minds can impact our health in a variety
            of different ways, such as research on stress or the placebo. This
            book takes these well-known concepts to an entirely new level to
            help you understand how to tap into your body's own innate ability
            to heal itself.<br /><br />Written from a deep sense of mission and
            love, Master Your Mind to Heal Your Body has the ability to change
            your world by showing you how to harness the greatest gift you have
            - the power of your mind - to heal your body and improve the quality
            of your life.<br /><br />Get started today and learn how you can be
            your own cure!
