          Philosophical discussions on the ways that death makes life meaningful
          and sacred<br /><br />• Reveals how being conscious of death gives our
          fate its full meaning, inviting the reader to contemplate life in the
          light of their own death<br /><br />• Examines the author’s experience
          of ancestor worship in his native China and the beliefs that underlie
          it<br /><br />• Explains how death is a transition in a longer living
          process not visible from the modern “black and white” view of life and
          death<br /><br />• Translated by award-winning translator Jody
          Gladding<br /><br />Born from intimate discussions with friends, these
          five meditations on death from poet-philosopher François Cheng examine
          the multiple ways the prospect of death significantly shapes life and
          is, in fact, what makes life meaningful and sacred.<br /><br />Written
          at the age of 84, in the twilight of life, these meditations each
          approach the human understanding of death from different yet
          intertwined perspectives, effortlessly returning to certain themes and
          ideas, questioning them again more deeply with each passing. The
          author shows that death is a transition in a longer living process not
          visible from the modern “black and white” view of life and death. He
          examines his experience of ancestor worship in his native China and
          the beliefs that underlies it: Our ancestors are alive in another
          form, that what is living can never die and what is dead has never
          lived. Cheng looks at the consequences of a world that has abandoned
          the sacred and avoids the mention of death, a world now blindly
          staggering through the chaos it has created, yet which can return to
          balance if we once again embrace the essential sacredness of life as
          well as death.<br /><br />Throughout these five heart-baring
          meditations, Cheng invites us to contemplate life in the light of our
          own death. He reveals that to be conscious of death gives our fate its
          full meaning. Our death is an integral part of our great adventure in
          becoming. For if birth is a seed, then death is the fruit--the final
          sacred product of a life well lived.
