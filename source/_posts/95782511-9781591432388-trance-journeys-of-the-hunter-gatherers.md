          Regaining oneness with the Earth through the practice of ecstatic
          trance <br />
          <br />• Explains how the shamanic techniques of ecstatic trance allow
          us to connect with animal spirit guides, shape-shift, and discover
          ways to help heal the Earth <br />
          <br />• Shows how to create personal rituals to maintain oneness with
          the Earth and all life <br />
          <br />• Illustrates trance postures and rituals from a variety of
          hunter-gatherer societies, including ancient Celtic, Norse, Native
          American, and South American traditions <br />
          <br />Early man ran with the animals, lived with the animals, and was
          one with the wild symphony of the natural world--a time fondly
          remembered as the Garden of Eden, or Idunn as it is known in Norse
          mythology. But as humanity shifted from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to
          one of farming and cities, embracing the modern worldview of man’s
          superiority over nature, we began ignoring our innate connection with
          the Earth. Now we are waking up to what we’ve lost, yearning to heal
          our relationship with the Earth and rekindle the oneness with nature
          that we naturally enjoyed as children. <br />
          <br />Drawing on the work of Felicitas Goodman, Thomas Berry, Ervin
          Laszlo, and other important voices calling for recognition of our
          connection with all life, author Nicholas Brink shows how ecstatic
          trance can return us to profound union with our Great Mother, the
          Earth. He details the specific healing and spiritual powers of trance
          postures and rituals from a variety of hunter-gatherer societies,
          including ancient Celtic, Norse, Native American, and South American
          traditions. He explains how the shamanic techniques of ecstatic trance
          allow us to access waking-dreamlike visions where we can connect with
          animal spirit guides, the six directions, and the seasons and discover
          ways to help heal the Earth. We can shape-shift to see through the
          eyes of each species of flora and fauna, interacting with life-forms
          in the skies, on land, in the seas, and underground, as well as
          journey to the realm of the dead to meet our ancestors. <br />
          <br />Sharing personal trance experiences of healing, spiritual
          connection, and divination, Brink shows how these practices enable us
          to create personal rituals to maintain oneness with all life. He
          reveals the spiritual power of being one with your environment and
          experiencing the spirits of everything around you. And, as we
          reconnect with the spirit of the Earth, we can once again experience
          the world not only as alive but also enchanted.

          “<i>Trance Journeys of the Hunter-Gatherers</i> is a masterful call to
          action with a passionate vision for how we can effectively participate
          in the time-critical, eco-spiritual awakening that is occurring now in
          Earth’s evolution. . . . Nick Brink has formulated a brilliant new
          spiritual lexicon to help us access and unlock the deeper meaning
          expressed in our multidimensional metaphoric journeys. For anyone who
          has had an experience with the ritual postures, or is considering
          learning more about them, reading this book is as close an experience
          that one could have to intrinsically feel the magnificence of what is
          truly possible in regaining our cosmic spiritual citizenship as
          evolutionary co-creators with Mother Earth.”
