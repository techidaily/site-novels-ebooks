          Throughout his life, Lincoln consulted oracles; at age 22, he was told
          by a seer that he would become president of the United States. In his
          dreams, he foresaw his own sudden death. Trauma and heartbreak opened
          the psychic door for this president, whose precognitive dreams, evil
          omens, and trance-like states are carefully documented in this bold
          and poignant chronicle of tragic beginnings, White House s√©ances, and
          paranormal eruptions of the Civil War era. Aided by the deathbed
          memoir of his favorite medium, Lincoln's remarkable psychic
          experiences comes to life with communications from beyond, ESP, true
          and false prophecies, and thumbnail sketches of the most influential
          spiritualists in his orbit. Surveying clairvoyant incidents in
          Lincoln's life from cradle to grave, the book also examines the
          Emancipation Proclamation and the unseen powers that moved pen to hand
          for its historic signing.

          nearly 150 years, historians have been arguing about Abraham Lincoln's

          presents compelling evidence that one of America's greatest and most
