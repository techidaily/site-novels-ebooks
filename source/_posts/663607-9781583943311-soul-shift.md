          Businessman Mark Ireland’s father was Richard Ireland, a deeply
          spiritual minister and renowned psychic and medium who counted Mae
          West among his famous clients. While he loved his father, Mark
          followed a more conventional path in pursuit of mainstream
          success—until the wrenching death of his youngest son. This unexpected
          tragedy plunges Mark into the spiritual world of psychics and mediums
          in a frantic attempt to communicate with the dead. His defenses and
          pragmatic mindset begin to fade as he remembers premonitions on the
          day of his son’s death. He consults a number of well-known mediums and
          is struck by the remarkably accurate information their readings
          provide. Mark first meets with Allison Dubois, the subject of NBC’s
          hit show <i>Medium</i>, and later participates in a single-blind lab
          experiment with medium Laurie Campbell, filmed for a Discovery Channel
          feature. He then enters a new dimension of personal paranormal
          experience, as his own psychic awareness begins to unfold. This
          dramatic story of a father’s unbearable loss and his discovery of life
          after death offers hope to the bereaved and compelling evidence that
          death may not be the end.

          “The death of his youngest son, Brandon, launched Mark Ireland on a
          fascinating quest to discover if we survive the death of our bodies by
          communicating with ancestors, persons who have gone before. For more
          than a century, many types of scientific inquiries have focused on
          after-death communications, and Mark studied all of them. He possesses
          the driving curiosity, open mind, and critical scholarship of a true
          explorer … [and] his candid, engaging writing style invites the reader
          to join him on his pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the
          afterlife.”—Donald E. Watson, MD, neuroscientist, psychiatrist, and
          author of <i>Surviving Your Crises, Reviving Your Dreams</i> "Not only
          heart-rending, intelligent, and well-written, but also a wonderful
          inspiration to anyone who has lost someone dear to them." —Tricia J
          Robertson; Hon Sec, former President, SSPR; DACE Tutor University of
          Glasgow; Hon Sec Prism“One of my favorites among the author’s many
          insights is his discovery that ‘It was time to re-think what it meant
          to be psychic.… Everyone is psychic.’ In my own academic research, I
          explore the apparent rift in our society between science and spirit.
          Mark’s metaphor of two wolves rings true for me: ‘Ours is a world that
          two wolves try to devour—the first is the wolf of skeptical science
          and religious fundamentalism (they are the same one). The second is
          the wolf of our cosmic connection, synchronicity, astral realms, and
          manifestation by intention. The wolf that dominates our life is the
          wolf we feed. I needed to feed the right wolf. I needed to lay it on
          the line from here on in.’ I volunteer to help Mark feed the wolf of
          synchronicity and connection. After you journey with Mark in this
          adventure through death, I expect you will want to join Mark
          also.”—Berney Williams, PhD, Dean of Graduate Studies, Energy Medicine
          University, and President of the International Society for the Study
          of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine"Mark Ireland is a moving writer
          who reaches out from the pages of his book and emotionally connects
          with his readers. He speaks not only from the perspective of a father
          who suffered the ultimate loss, but also as a man who inherited the
          ability to reconnect with those who've passed on. This book is a must
          read for anyone trying to comprehend life after death or wanting to
          learn how loss can create an even stronger bond between the living and
          those who live again."—Allison DuBois; Subject of NBC’s <i>Medium</i>;
          Author of
          <i
            >Don't Kiss Them Good-Bye, We Are Their Heaven, And Secrets of the
            Monarch</i
          >"As a survival of consciousness researcher and explorer, I found Mark
          Ireland’s book, <i>Soul Shift, </i>to<i> </i>be authentic, scientific
          in its approach, and very healing. I laughed, cried, and pondered the
          afterlife. Mark Ireland’s late father—the remarkable&nbsp;Dr. Richard
          Ireland, was a man of rare psychic and mediumistic talent. Richard
          Ireland participated in testing, counseled celebrities like Mae West,
          and Amanda Blake, and also prominent government leaders. This book is
          a must read." —Maria Talcott, Founding Member of the John E. Mack
          Institute in conjunction with John Mack, MD, Cambridge MA“Mark Ireland
          has done a superb job of bringing the unknown up from the depths of
          the Anima Mundi to the surface of human consciousness. This book
          impacted my soul, inspiring me to reach out to people once again. It
          also made me yearn for home.”—Cullen Dorn, author of <i>The</i>
