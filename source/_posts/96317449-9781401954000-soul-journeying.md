            >Bestselling author Alberto Villoldo presents ways to heal yourself
            from past and future events through soul retrieval.<br /></b
          ><br />This fascinating book by best-selling author, psychologist, and
          medical anthropologist Alberto Villoldo explains the practices for
          healing outside of ordinary time and space. It shows you how to enter
          the timeless now to heal events that occurred in the past, and to
          correct the course of destiny. Dr. Villoldo discusses ways in which
          you can heal yourself and your loved ones by employing intention
          through practices used by shamans of the Americas—which, until now,
          have been inaccessible to most of the world. The shamans of old called
          this <i>journeying</i>.<br /><br />In this book, you’ll discover that
          you have a four-chambered heart in the same way you have a
          four-chambered soul. In the first chamber, you store away the memory
          of a wound that derailed your destiny. In the second, you keep the
          limiting beliefs and soul contracts that you entered into at the time
          of your loss. In the third, you recover the grace and trust that will
          make you whole again; and in the fourth, you remember the calling and
          mission that you choose to unfold in this lifetime.<br /><br />“While
          everyone has a future,” Villoldo says, “only certain people have a
          destiny.” This book shows you how to find and manifest yours.

            same time lets us see into the magical workings of the universe. But
            this is more than just a description—it is a path to well-being and
