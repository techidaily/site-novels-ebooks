          <p>
            Are you feeling lost in life? Do your emotions sometimes overwhelm
            you? Do you wonder why bad things happen? Written for readers from
            diverse backgrounds, this book explores the purpose of our emotional
            journey through life from a psycho-soul perspective and helps us
            answer the question "Why am I here?" It is a handbook for surviving
            the inevitable ups and downs that we all must cope with as we
            experience the intense emotions of life. With therapeutic insights
            drawn from over 30 years' experience as a clinical psychologist, and
            based on his own autobiographical journey, Dr. Lindal invites you to
            look at your life through a different lens. While in part a
            fictionalized story, the teachings he offers on self-exploration and
            understanding will help you understand the purpose of your
            existence. Dr. Lindal's teachings are woven into an 'easy-to-read'
            story that follows the adventures of Rikki, whose soul sets off on a
            journey from the Spiritual Dimension into a lifetime on Earth. Born
            to parents in Iceland, Rikki's boyhood and early teenage years are
            woven into Icelandic folklore, which includes ghosts, elves, and
            trolls, until one day, he meets Old Soul who becomes his spiritual
            mentor. In conversations with Old Soul and over the course of this
            lifetime, as he leaves the shores of his native land and immigrates
            to Canada and to England, Rikki learns about earthly existence and
            how we are responsible for creating our own reality within it. He
            also learns about our simultaneous spiritual existence within the
            Spiritual Dimension and the reasons why we choose to experience
            negative emotions in life. In his numerous conversations with Old
            Soul, Rikki is given important lessons about fate and free will. He
            learns about love, how love develops between lovers, and his own
            sexual orientation. He also learns about the negative emotions, such
            as; fear, anxiety, anger, depression, guilt, power and hate, and the
            circumstances that may lead people to perform evil acts, and ways to
            prevent that from happening. Rikki's inspirational backstory of
            coming to terms with his own sexuality is woven into the storyline
            of this book, with the intent to motivate the reader to find purpose
            and meaning in their soul's own adventure through life. (Note: This
            is a revised and an expanded 2nd edition of Dr. Lindal's initial
            book, published in 2012, under the title Slice Of Life: A Self-Help
            Odyssey).

          Tofts Reviews. Pub Date: July 30, 2014.The reader does not have to be
          religious, or a member of a faith-based system, to benefit from this
          book. Dr. Rick Lindal gives meaning to life's most difficult questions
          in an easy to read and understand narrative. By using a character and
          novel-type story, the author captivates the reader while explaining
          the soul's emotional journey. By using fictional characters, Rikki,
          and Old Soul, the information is presented in a series of
          conversations. (Rikki, the child and Old Soul, his God-like mentor).
          This makes overwhelming topics easy to comprehend. Rikki asks if he
          has control of his destiny. The answer is simple and honest. "You
          create your reality through fluid relationships that occur between the
          uniqueness of your soul, trance states, emotions, long-term goals,
          intent, fate, and free will." All of these factors are expanded and
          explained in detail. Old Soul speaks about Core Beliefs (fate, free
          will, uniqueness, action, cognitive contrast, aging and death), and
          the importance of these in the creation and foundation of the soul's
          emotional journey. The topics of Love and Evil are beautifully
          explained with historic examples. The format is intriguing; Old Soul's
          lines are in blue ink, while the rest of the dialogue and narrative
          are in classic black. This is brilliant on the part of the design
          because it makes it a quick read. The text seems to be "chunked" and
          that makes it easier to absorb the information. The Purpose: Your
          Soul's Emotional Journey is an excellent book for anyone questioning
          their journey in life, their beliefs, and the ultimate question:
          "why".Kirkus Reviews. Oct. 16, 2014.Fictionalized account of one
          soul's discovery of the spiritual self challenging conventional views
          of both faith and psychology, Lindal, a clinical psychologist, takes
          readers on a journey into what he calls the Spiritual Dimension. This
          dimension, at once hidden and yet accessible to people, is the home of
          all human souls. In a bold, helpful approach, Lindal uses fiction
          heavily laced with autobiography to introduce his concepts.... Through
          discussions with Old Soul, Rikki learns that all people are
          incarnations of much older souls, which reincarnate many times in
          order to experience emotions, especially negative ones: Life on Earth
          is essentially about discovering who you are through creation, that
          is, the creation of experiences that bring about emotions within you.
          Through these experiences, souls mature and evolve. A major theme of
          the book is that each person creates his or her own reality. This is
          done before life begins, but it is also done as we live life, since we
          have free will to make our own choices. Knowledge of this reality, the
          author says, is helpful to people as they struggle through life's
          problems and face life's big questions. Lindal's choice of fiction to
          couch a discussion of the Spiritual Dimension works well, as it allows
          the book to describe the author's ideas in a personalized manner. An
          engaging introduction to what, Lindal says, is a world just outside
          our grasp.Please go to the websites page "www.thepurpose.ca" for
