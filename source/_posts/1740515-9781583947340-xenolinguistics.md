          Are language and consciousness co-evolving? Can psychedelic experience
          cast light on this topic? In the Western world, we stand at the dawn
          of the psychedelic age with advances in neuroscience; a proliferation
          of new psychoactive substances, both legal and illegal; the
          anthropology of ayahuasca use; and new discoveries in ethnobotany.
          From scientific papers to the individual trip reports on the Vaults of
          Erowid and the life work of Terence McKenna, Alexander and Ann
          Shulgin, and Stanislav Grof, we are converging on new knowledge of the
          mind and how to shift its functioning for therapeutic, spiritual,
          problem-solving, artistic and/or recreational purposes. In our
          culture, pychonautics, the practices of individuals and small groups
          using techniques such as meditation, shamanic ritual, ecstatic dance
          and substances such as LSD and psilocybin for personal exploration, is
          a field of action and thought in its infancy. The use of psychonautic
          practice as a site of research and a method of knowledge production is
          central to this work, the first in-depth book focusing on
          psychedelics, consciousness, and language.<br /><br /><i>
            Xenolinguistics</i
          >
          documents the author's eleven-year adventure of psychonautic
          exploration and scholarly research; her original intent was to
          understand a symbolic language system, Glide, she acquired in an
          altered state of consciousness. What began as a deeply personal
          search, led to the discovery of others, dubbed xenolinguists, with
          their own unique linguistic objects and ideas about language from the
          psychedelic sphere. The search expanded, sifting through fields of
          knowledge such as anthropology and neurophenomenology to build maps
          and models to contextualize these experiences. The book presents a
          collection of these linguistic artifacts, from glossolalia to alien
          scripts, washed ashore like messages in bottles, signals from Psyche
          and the alien Others who populate her hyperdimensional landscapes.<br /><br />
          With an entire chapter dedicated to Terence and Dennis McKenna and
          sections dedicated to numerous other xenolinguists, this book will
          appeal to those interested in language/linguistics and the benefits of
          psychedelic self-exploration, and to readers of science fiction.

        <p>
          “Diana Reed Slattery, the author and also the inventor (or perhaps
          discoverer is the better term) of <i>Xenolinguistics,</i> her chosen
          field, has been exploring the far fringes of the entheosphere for some
          fifteen years now, mostly with the help of her fungal friends and an
          occasional assist from MDMA. She is a psychonaut’s psychonaut, boldly
          pushing off into the numinous oceans of mind in complete solitude, in
          darkness, often in isolated and remote locations, no copilot off the
          left wing for this pioneer. Equipped with nothing more than a journal,
          pen, and of course the key instrument, her discerning and penetrating
          intellect, she has established contact with an alien Logos, and not
          just contacted it, but wrested its secrets from the very heart of the
          Weird. She has returned from her expeditions to the Outer Mongolias of
          the mind with that rarest of gifts, an alien artifact, Glide, the
          sinuous, elegant and enigmatic metalanguage that she shares with us in
          this book. Anyone with serious interest in the cartography of the
          psychedelic cosmos and the wonders encountered there will find fertile
          ground for astonishment, appreciation, and puzzlement within these
          pages.”<br />
          —Dennis McKenna<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Weaving together a wide range of scientific, artistic, and
          experiential voices, Diana Reed Slattery plunges into one of the
          outstanding enigmas of psychedelia: the place of language. Picking up
          where Terence McKenna left off, she probes the altered states of
          language, from shamanic eloquence to ‘downloaded’ symbols to the
          Other's alien speech. Bringing extraordinary experiences into
          sparkling dialogue with critical theoretical issues, Slattery has
          created a marvelous and insightful exemplar of psychonautics in the
          21st century.”<br />

          “In<i>
            Xenolinguistics: Psychedelics, Language, and the Evolution of
            Consciousness,</i
          >
          Diana Reed Slattery provides an intriguing and far-reaching
          non-fictional investigation of the linguistic and symbolic
          constructions of alien languages, such as the visual language Glide on
          which she based her fascinating novel, <i>The Maze Game.</i> Combining
          first-hand experience, accounts from other ‘psychonauts’ who use
          psychedelics to explore unknown territories in altered states of
          consciousness, and scientific research on the entwinement of language
          and consciousness, Slattery’s book is highly synthetic and
          provocative, an exhilarating voyage into what it means to encounter
          the linguistic alien within and without the self.”<br />

          “The investigation of language systems presented in
          <i
            >Xenolinguistics: Psychedelics, Language, and the Evolution of
            Consciousness</i
          >
          is a bold step forward into the documented but seldom discussed use of
          psychonautic practices by scientists and philosophers. As people from
          ancient times onward have used psychoactive substances to deepen their
          understanding of the world, this research into the construction of
          alien linguistics applies these venerable tools with focus and
          discipline. Diana Reed Slattery's courageous immersion into expanded
          consciousness for the purpose of knowledge creation is part of an
          exciting new era of exploration and discovery that will continue to
          inspire future generations of researchers.”<br />
          —Annie Oak, founder, Women's Visionary Congress<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Xenolinguistics</i> is one of the most compelling and interesting
          books that I've ever read in my life; I found it truly difficult to
          put down. Part frontier science, part mystery adventure, part alien
          language manual, and part interdisciplinary philosophy, this uniquely
          envisioned book is impossible to categorize in any traditional form.
          Slattery breaks new ground, bravely exploring the fascinating
          relationship between symbolic representation, psychonaut ‘downloads,’
          consciousness, and reality. Future generations will surely recognize
          this cutting-edge book for helping to establish the foundation of
          humanity’s post-larval entry into the extraterrestrial and
          inter-dimensional arenas of interspecies communication. Masterfully
          crafted, alchemically blending a wide range of perspectives, and
          overflowing with fascinating details about secret languages, rare
          treasures composed of unusual information, and profound insights
          elegantly expressed. Psychedelic explorers, science fiction lovers,
          and students of the unexplained will savor every sentence in this
          brilliant and thought-provoking book. You can bet that the aliens are
          certainly paying attention!”<br />

          <i>Mavericks of the Mind</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Diana Reed Slattery's <i>Xenolinguistics</i> is an extraordinary
          work: at once a heroic and breathtaking psychonaut’s tale, a highly
          original philosophical treatise concerning what happens at the edge of
          language and beyond, and a neurophenomenological meditation that
          beckons us towards sciences of the future.”<br />
          —Marcus Boon, author of
          <i>The Road of Excess: A History of Writers on Drugs</i><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “Seen through the lens of her perspectives on language, Slattery’s
          <i>Xenolinguistics</i> provides a comprehensive introduction to the
          possibilities of disciplined exploration of non-ordinary states of
          consciousness. Her work catalogues the ways that transdimensional
          reality may be accessed and explicates its utility as a kind of cosmic
          search engine from which information on individual self-transformation
          and collective human ventures may be gathered in a systematic and
          expedient way.”<br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          “The ineffable Other has a faithful scribe, and it is Diana Reed
          Slattery. Slattery has crafted the first codex of languages reaching
          back to us from the unspeakable. Magic was always incanted into being
          through alien languages. Slattery has reopened the linguistic doorway
          for our return to magic.She bravely glided behind the mesh of the
          cosmos and returned with the news: its all built of language!”<br />
          —Bruce Damer, PhD, author of
          <i>Avatars!: Exploring and Building Virtual Worlds on the Internet</i
          ><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “The intersection of human language and the psychedelic experience was
          initially brought to light through the work of Terence McKenna. Since
          his death in 2000, however, there has been far too little work in this
          field. In fact, I know of only one person who is qualified to take it
          to the next level. That person is Diana Reed Slattery. Her scholarly
          background, coupled with a deep understanding of psychedelic culture,
          places Diana in a perfect position to help us explore one of the
          central features of our lives, language. Whether you are an
          experienced psychonaut or budding linguist,
          <i
            >Xenolinguistics: Psychedelics, Language, and the Evolution of
            Consciousness</i
          >
          is a book that belongs in your personal library.”<br />
          —Lorenzo Hagerty, host of Psychedelic Salon podcasts, and author of
          <i>The Genesis Generation </i>and<i> The Spirit of the Internet</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Slattery provides us with a first-person ethnographic account of the
          psychonautic landscape where a first-person science—phenomenological
          methods and self-reflexivity—organizes her encounters in entheogenic
          realms.&nbsp;She places psychedelic experiences within a discourse on
          the phenomenology of knowledge and epistemology and other psychonautic
          accounts. Her analyses provide a transdisciplinary scope for analyzing
          the nature of entheogenic worlds. Slattery illustrates how psychedelic
          technologies extend perception and the senses and permit a
          reorganization of reality within which the psychonaut functions as an
          ontological engineer of the entheogenic landscape. The book examines
          psychedelics in terms of their effects in enhancing certain aspects of
          extended perception and the increased focus on the mechanics of the
          formation of perception and reality. A combination of phenomenological
          description and neurological analysis leads us to a glimpse of a
          neurophenomenological understanding of the neurognostic landscape of
          crystal vision, extended perception, hyperconnectivity,
          hyperconductivity, and multilayered realities and consciousness.
          &nbsp;<i>Xenolinguistics’ </i>engagement with entheogenic realities
          through dialogue with the alien other and emergent xenolinguistic
          systems instills a zest for the exploration of the further realms of
          consciousness.”<br />

          <i>Psychedelic Medicine</i> and <i>Altering</i> <i>Consciousness</i
          ><br /><br />
          “Effing the ineffable—how to communicate the wordless unspeakable,
          think the preconceptual, visualize the invisible, symbolize the
          powerful-vague—psychedelicists and other travelers to other realms of
          consciousness have been stumped by these topics for millennia. By
          collecting current and historical examples, Slattery’s
          <i>Xenolinguistics </i>tackles these conundrums, applies current
          consciousness theories, and sheds light into these esoteric corners of
          human communication. Xenolinguistics challenge its readers to wrestle
          with these topics and to pursue further explorations. The result? A
          sort of psychedelic psycholinguistics plus an ineffable more.”<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          DIANA REED SLATTERY was born in time to compile a full 60s resume:
          civil rights photojournalism, peace marching, communes. Social
          justice, self-exploration, and LSD went hand in hand. She went on to
          co-found an ecologically oriented K-12 school with working farm,
          dairy, livestock, and forestry that held the first renewable energy
          conference in Oregon. She later continued her career by founding,
          funding, and managing a series of not-for-profit organizations. In
          1999, in an altered state of consciousness, she acquired a strange,
          alien script, Glide, beginning a ten-year psychonautic investigation
          of linguistic phenomena in the psychedelic sphere. Out of this
          solo—and secret—adventure came a novel, The Maze Game, a million words
          of session reports, software to work with the language, and a PhD in
          xenolinguistics. Slattery lives in California, and has presented her
          work at numerous art, technology, consciousness, and psychedelic
          conferences over the past 15 years.
