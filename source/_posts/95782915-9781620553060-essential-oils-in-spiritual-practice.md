          Using essential oils to influence your energetic make-up and karmic
          patterns <br /><br />• Details how to identify which tattvas--the Five
          Great Elements--are dominant in your energetic make-up <br /><br />•
          Explores the energetic signatures of the essential oils associated
          with each tattva and chakra, including their archetypes, sacred
          geometry, sacred sounds, and colors <br /><br />• Explains how to
          identify your personal vibrational signature, purify your energy body,
          impart vibrational properties to jewelry, and work with yantras and
          mantras <br /><br />The <i>tattvas</i>, the Five Great
          Elements--earth, water, fire, air/wind, and ether/space--create and
          sustain not only the universe but also all of its inhabitants. Each of
          us has a unique combination of these elemental energies behind our
          personal characteristics--everything from the color of our eyes to our
          behaviors and emotional temperament. What tattvas are dominant in your
          make-up can also be influenced by your surroundings and by karma.
          Essential oils, in addition to working biologically and chemically,
          also work at the energetic level, making them ideal for working with
          the tattvas. <br /><br />Teaching you how to use essential oils to
          affect the very fabric of your being, Candice Covington details how
          the Tattvas Method of essential oils allow you to access the deepest,
          most hidden aspects of Self, those beyond the reach of the mind, the
          very energetic causation patterns that set all behaviors and thoughts
          into motion. She reveals how the tattvas are the energy that animate
          each chakra and how we can use their archetypal energy to shape our
          inner life and align with our greater soul purpose. The author
          provides energetic profiles of each tattva, chakra, and essential oil,
          explains their relationships to one another, and details how to
          identify what tattva or chakra is dominant at any given time.
          Exploring the energetic signatures of the tattvic essential oils, she
          details their elemental make-up, animal and deity archetypes, sacred
          geometry symbols, sacred syllables, and colors. She reveals how to
          discover the energy patterns responsible for directing unhealthy life
          patterns and explains how to identify your personal vibrational
          signature, purify your energy body, and craft your own unique ritual
          practice with essential oils. <br /><br />Showing how essential oils
          are powerful vibrational tools for effecting change, the author
          reveals how they allow each of us to deliberately steer our own
          destiny, fulfill our personal dharma, and be all that our souls
          intended us to be.

        <p>
          “Before formal analytic analysis, before formal scientific methods,
          people asked questions about reality and focused on observations of
          the world and on subjective experience. Theories of outer and inner
          reality were a part of every culture and every spiritual tradition.
          From the perspective of contemporary Western science, many of these
          systems are hard to understand and integrate with our worldview. In
          particular, systems that use and incorporate subjective experience may
          seem intuitively powerful, yet they remain difficult to integrate into
          our sense of reality and are therefore difficult to believe. Candice
          Covington does a brilliant job of explaining Vedic understanding and
          the five elements and integrating this worldview with contemporary
          archetypal psychology and contemporary scientific thinking. This is a
          good and powerful read. Challenge yourself and enjoy.”
