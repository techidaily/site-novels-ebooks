          A collection of tales from the Middle Ages that reveal voyages to
          Heaven and Hell, the realm of the Faery, mystical lands, and
          encounters with mythic beasts <br /><br />• Shares travelers’ accounts
          of voyages into the afterlife, alarming creatures of unparalleled
          strangeness, encounters with doppelgangers and angels, chivalric
          romantic misadventures, and legends of heroes <br /><br />• Explains
          how travelers’ tales from the Middle Ages drew on geographies,
          encyclopedias, travel accounts, bestiaries, and herbals for material
          to capture the imagination of their audiences <br /><br />• Includes
          rare illustrations from incunabula and medieval manuscripts
          <br /><br />Heading off to discover unknown lands was always a risky
          undertaking during the Middle Ages due to the countless dangers lying
          in wait for the traveler--if we can believe what the written accounts
          tell us. In the medieval age of intercontinental exploration, tales of
          sea monsters, strange hybrid beasts, trickster faeries, accidental
          trips to the afterlife, and peoples as fantastic and dangerous as the
          lands they inhabited abounded. <br /><br />In this curated collection
          of medieval travelers’ tales, editors Claude and Corinne Lecouteux
          explain how the Middle Ages were a melting pot of narrative traditions
          from the four corners of the then-known world. Tales from this period
          often drew on geographies, encyclopedias, travel accounts, bestiaries,
          and herbals for material to capture the imagination of their
          audiences, who were fascinated by the wonders being discovered by
          explorers of the time. <br /><br />Accompanied by rare illustrations
          from incunabula and medieval manuscripts, the stories in this
          collection include voyages into the afterlife, with guided tours of
          Hell and glimpses of Heaven, as well as journeys into other fantastic
          realms, such as the pagan land of the Faery. It also includes accounts
          from travelers such as Alexander the Great of alarming creatures of
          unparalleled strangeness, encounters with doppelgangers and angels,
          legends of heroes, and tales of chivalric romantic misadventures, with
          protagonists swept to exotic new places by fate or by quest. In each
          story, the marvelous is omnipresent, and each portrays the reactions
          of the protagonist when faced with the unknown. <br /><br />Offering
          an introduction to the medieval imaginings of a wondrous universe,
          these tales reflect the dreams and beliefs of the Middle Ages’ era of
          discovery and allow readers to survey mythic geography, meet people
          from the far ends of the earth, and experience the supernatural.
