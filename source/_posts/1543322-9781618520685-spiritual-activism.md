          Steve Jobs and others like him teach us about a higher or inner
          knowledge and about the use of spiritual keys for success. These keys
          work because they are linked to universal laws that govern our
          universe regardless of whether we choose to learn and live by them or
          not. Our actions all have consequences. People who choose to recognize
          the consequence of success use keys governed by basic physics. They
          consciously choose actions according to notions of principles. Wanda
          Krause calls people who have learned these keys or principles, and
          actively use them, spiritual activists. &nbsp;<br /><br />In her
          book,<i
            >&nbsp;Spiritual Activism: Keys for Personal and Political
            Success</i
          >, Krause provides 12 keys for success that include principles taught
          by mystics and are grounded in physical laws of the universe. Through
          observations, interviews, and direct participation with hundreds of
          activists over a 12-year period, she has found their challenges are
          becoming more and more complex, yet they are still able to discover
          keys to success no matter what country they are in, the various
          aspects of the culture around them, or the particular challenges they
          face.&nbsp;<br /><br />Krause presents ten activists’ stories to show
          how they achieve real success. Themes include overcoming personal
          challenges, such as substance abuse or cancer, creating true miracles,
          entrepreneurship, service after a life of abandonment, post-war peace,
          politics around new environmental threats, terrorism, politics around
          nuclear programs, lessons from the Arab Spring, compassionate justice
          and a new world economic system. The activists provide awareness of
          their concerns while they provide guidance and examples using
          spiritual keys. For Krause, whether struggles are considered personal
          or political they are all embedded in power dynamics that must be
          transformed, and it is her belief that spiritual activism is the only
          sustainable way forward.<br /><br />It is important to note not all of
          those she identifies in her book as spiritual activists affirm a
          religious belief – some are atheists, some are agnostic – the
          important message here is these are imperfect beings that truly align
          their goals with conscious duty and purpose with a strong inner
          calling and principled action.&nbsp;<i>Spiritual Activism</i
          >&nbsp;offers the essential keys to success, with success defined as
          achieving all that is going to help readers live with purpose. These
          12 keys include:Living Your PurposeSpiritual IntelligenceEnergy
          VibrationsInterdependenceThe Law of AttractionPurificationDeveloping
          Your Whole SelfBeliefs of the MindThe Law of LoveIntention for
          ManifestationPrayerFaith in the DivineReaders will easily identify
          with the spiritual activists in Krause’s book; there is nothing
          otherworldly or extraordinary about them other than their chosen
          commitment to lead a life filled with meaning and, as a result, they
          are helping to change the world for the betterment of everyone.
