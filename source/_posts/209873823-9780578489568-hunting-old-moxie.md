            Fifteen feet high.&nbsp; Twenty-five hundred pounds.&nbsp;
            Grayish-white in color.&nbsp; This was the common description of Old
            Moxie, otherwise known as the Specter Moose of Lobster Lake,
            Maine.&nbsp; His antlers spread twelve feet across and were spiked
            with over forty tines.&nbsp; His hoofprint measured ten inches
            wide.&nbsp; He had a double mane that fell on each side of his neck,
            and the “bell” hanging under his chin was eighteen inches long.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hunter Shoots at Monster Whose Existence Was Doubted,” reported the
            New York Times on November 5, 1899: “A party of hunters have created
            great excitement among the sportsmen and guides here by the
            announcement that they have seen the great gray moose that has
            haunted the vicinity of Lobster Lake for the past seven years.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And the Times wasn’t the only national paper breaking the news that
            day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Boston Herald: “The king of all Maine moose, sometimes called
            the ‘spectre moose,’ because of the weird appearance of the gray
            monster at night, has again been seen near Lobster Lake, and the
            news has set the sportsmen, native hunters and guides crazy to get a
            shot at him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Boston Globe: “For years and years there has been an enormous
            moose in the region around Moosehead Lake.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Boston Journal: “Formerly this moose was regarded as a mythical
            creature—a monster conjured up by excited imaginations, but lately
            it has been demonstrated that he really exists, and that he is as
            big as anyone has declared him to be.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The year 1899 was just the beginning.&nbsp; For over half a century
            the Specter Moose would reign as the crowned terror of the Maine
            Woods.&nbsp; They say that L.L. Bean wore out his first pair of
            boots in search of him.&nbsp; Big game hunter President Teddy
            Roosevelt wanted to pursue him.&nbsp; Big game maker Milton Bradley
            wanted to outplay those in pursuit.&nbsp; Governor Percival Baxter
            created a state park to protect him. &nbsp;And Fly Rod Crosby,
            Maine’s femme venatrix fatale, thought he was just plain bad for
            tourism.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Sportsmen from across the country and around the globe rushed to the
            Maine Woods to get a crack at the Specter Moose.&nbsp; But the
            antlered abomination defied bullets, defied death, and defied
            logic.&nbsp; Civil War hero Joshua Chamberlain feared there would be
            no Appomattox in the Specter Moose War.
          </p>
          <p>And he was right.</p>
