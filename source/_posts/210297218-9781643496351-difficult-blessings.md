            "Take Maddie home and make her comfortable for whatever time she has
            left." Maddie's parents were hearing these words from the doctor
            after their four-year-old daughter was diagnosed with pulmonary
            arterial hypertension, an incurable life-threatening disease. It was
            1997, when there were very few options other than a lung transplant
            to treat Maddie's disease. Because her parents were unwilling to
            accept this fate for their daughter, they ended up at the Children's
            Hospital in Denver, Colorado. Maddie became one of the early
            pioneers of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the late 1990s when
            research was just beginning to develop therapies that were an
            alternative to lung transplantation; treatments that provided hope!
            This true and inspiring story chronicles Maddie's twenty-year
            journey of courage and strength. Maddie was an example of
            determination to all who knew her. Even people who had never met
            Maddie were inspired by her story. Maddie not only battled pulmonary
            arterial hypertension, but at the age of six she was diagnosed with
            acute lymphocytic leukemia. Maddie conquered cancer and lived on to
            receive two separate lung transplants. Although this is a book about
            an amazing girl who rose above her adversity to live a full and
            happy life, it is also a book about discovery. This is a mother's
            story of how her daughters pain and suffering became vehicles for
            uncovering her own inner strength and for learning valuable life
            lessons. The wisdom learned in these hard-gained lessons is what she
            calls "difficult blessings."
