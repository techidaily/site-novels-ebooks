          • Explores the hierarchy of elemental beings as well as Christ
          elemental beings, social elementals, and machine elementals
          <br /><br />• Explains how elementals inhabit the etheric space that
          houses our emotions, feelings, and thoughts and how they carry the
          emotional level of the world <br /><br />• Shows how the author
          learned to make personal contact with the elementals and shares his
          experiences as well as the elemental world’s urgent call for help
          <br /><br />We all live in the realm of elemental beings. They
          permeate our souls, our thoughts, our feelings, and they co-create the
          world around us, yet we are often completely unaware of them. They,
          however, are eager to be perceived and acknowledged by us because
          their future and ours are fundamentally connected.<br /><br />Elementals
          act as carriers of the emotional level of the world, and Thomas Mayer
          reveals how he learned to develop and fine-tune his sense of
          perception to make direct personal contact with them. Providing
          insight into the elemental hierarchy, from the low workers to the
          masters and the elemental kings, he portrays Christ elemental beings,
          social elementals, and machine elementals as well. He also explores
          the adversarial forces like Lucifer and Ahriman that access the
          elemental world through the subconscious of humans and seek to destroy
          our elemental friends.<br /><br />Through sharing his encounters with
          fairies, dwarves, giants, and others, the author reveals their urgent
          call for help, an entreaty to anchor the elemental beings again in the
          awareness of humankind through recognition, acknowledgment, and
          conscious connection. Let us support the elementals in their crucial,
          life-giving work, through which they in turn support us in preserving
          the Earth we live on.

          "There is a lot of information to ruminate over and to digest between
          the covers of <i>Answering the Call of the Elementals</i>. Mayer uses
          the teachings of Austrian philosopher and esotericist Rudolf Steiner
          as the underpinnings of this book giving a layer of Christian
          mysticism to a topic that is also part and parcel of pagan practices.
          This makes the content more globally based and underscores the
          intention of its writing; collaboration and co-creation between
          humanity and the realms of the more ephemeral beings."
