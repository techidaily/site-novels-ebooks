            These stories of the Buddha-Rebirths are not for one age or for one
            country, but for all time, and for the whole world. Their philosophy
            might be incorporated into the tenets of faith of a League of
            Nations without destroying any national forms of religious teaching.
            On the other hand those who prefer the foundation of more orthodox
            views will be astonished to find their ethics are identical with
            many of those inculcated in the stories: here we find condemnation
            of hypocrisy, cruelty, selfishness, and vice of every kind and a
            constant appeal to Love, Pity, Honesty, loftiness of purpose and
            breadth of vision. And should we reject such teachings because they
            were given to the World more than 2,000 years ago? Since it is wise
            to take into consideration the claims and interests of the passing
            hour it is well to re-introduce these stories at a moment when,
            perhaps more than ever before, East and West are struggling to
            arrive at a clearer understanding of one another.

            In Tagore's essay on the relation of the Individual to the Universe,
            he says: "In the West the prevalent feeling is that Nature belongs
            exclusively to inanimate things and to beasts; that there is a
            sudden unaccountable break where human nature begins. According to
            it, everything that is low in the scale of beings is merely nature,
            and whatever has the stamp of perfection on it, intellectual or
            moral, is human nature. It is like dividing the bud and the blossom
            into two separate categories and putting their grace to the credit
            of two different and antithetical principles. But the Indian mind
            never has any hesitation in acknowledging its kinship with nature,
            its unbroken relation with all."
          </p>

          <p>
            This is perhaps the best summing up of the value of this collection.
            Since the publication of the book in 1910, I have had many
            opportunities of testing the value of the dramatic appeal in these
            stories both for adults and boys and girls of adolescent age. When
            presented at this impressionable period, the inner meaning will sink
            more deeply into their minds than the same truths presented in a
            more direct and didactic fashion.

            I am greatly indebted to Professor Rhys Davids, not only because he
            has placed the material of his translations from the Pali at my
            disposal, but also because of his unfailing kindness and help in
            directing my work. I am fortunate to have had the restraining
            influence of so great a scholar so that I might not lose the Indian
            atmosphere and line of thought which is of such value in these
            stories.

            I most gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to the Cambridge
            Press, by whose courtesy I have been able to include several of the
            stories published in their volumes.
          </p>

          <p>I present here a selection from over 500 stories.</p>
