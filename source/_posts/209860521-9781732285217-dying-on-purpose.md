            Richard Steinhoff had it all—a beautiful home, a loving wife, a
            successful career in real estate, and a best-selling book.&nbsp;
            Then a diseased gallbladder landed him in the hospital, and a series
            of complications nearly killed him. While he was there, he had an
            out-of-body, Near-Death Experience and encountered a Heavenly being
            who told him to return to his body because he had not yet completed
            his Life’s Purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            He immediately set out on a journey to discover his purpose. When he
            found it and stopped living Off-Purpose, he knew he didn’t want to
            see another soul living Off-Purpose. That’s when he decided to share
            his story in this book.&nbsp; His purpose was not just to tell his
            story; it was to help people change their lives and live a happy,
            fulfilled life.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone on this planet was put here for a purpose.</p>
          <p>If you don’t know yours, you need to read this book.</p>

          estate offices. He really knows how to get things done. Yet he points

          live On- Purpose. His story is and is an inspiring tale from despair
          to hope to find one’s calling. Thanks, Richard, for the guidelines and
