            >Most of us focus on thinking positively to create what we really
            want in life. But science shows it's actually our feelings that
            matter most.<br /></b
          ><br />In her relatable and engaging way, psychologist and researcher,
          Melanie Dean, Ph.D., explains not just what to do to shift your
          emotions and focus your energy to attract the people, things, and
          opportunities you want most in life, but <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> it
          works.<br /><br />Once you understand that your feelings and emotions
          are real energy waves that go out into the world and connect with (or
          repel) others, you can start to notice and shift your emotions-and
          intentionally direct your energy-so you are sending out the waves that
          will connect with what you really want.<br /><br />By reading
          <i>The Hidden Power of Emotions</i>, you will discover:<br /><b>•</b
          >&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a whole world of energy at work in, around, and
          through you.<br /><b>•</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your emotions, which are more
          powerful than your thoughts, create energy waves that leave your body,
          connecting with similar energy.<br /><b>•</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Your emotions
          are the way in which you receive communication back from the shared
          energy field.<br /><b>•</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;How to purposefully direct your
          emotions to connect you with what you want to receive.<br /><br />Throughout
          the book, Dean highlights the science behind your power as well as
          specific tips and strategies to help you apply it in your everyday
          life, including a Power Zapper section of common struggles that weaken
          your power, and a Power Booster section of recommendations for
          increasing your personal power.

          “Keen insights on a super power we all have, yet few know how to use.
          This is a fantastic look at how to harness the energy of the universe
          to do your bidding, with easy examples, fun exercises, and step by
          step guidance. I highly recommend it.”<br />— <b>Mike Dooley</b>,
          author of the <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller
          <i>Infinite Possibilities<br /><br /></i>“Melanie Dean’s delightful
          mix of personal experiences, scientific explanations, and pragmatic
          guidance is a fresh look at how to craft your life, health, and
          passions. No longer just a New-Age catchphrase, ‘creating your
          reality’ is quite real and within your reach. Read
          <i>The Hidden Power of Emotions</i> to discover how!”<br />—
          <b>Dean Radin, Ph.D.</b>, author of <i>Real Magic </i>and Chief
          Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences<br /><br />“A perfectly
          accessible guide to our inner life and its secrets, grounded in
          science. With many of her own and others’ examples to illustrate,
          Melanie Dean sets up the possibilities for a better-lived life.
          Everyone can benefit from this book.”<br />— <b>John P. Schuster</b>,
          author of <i>The Power of Your Past</i> and
          <i>Answering Your Call<br /><br /></i>“Dr. Dean has made the science
          of emotions so understandable that anyone can apply this knowledge to
          create the life of their dreams. In her groundbreaking book,
          <i>The Hidden Powerof Emotions</i>, she reveals the science of
          manifestation with such amazing clarity that we suddenly see ourselves
          alive with new possibilities. When science and spirituality are
          integrated as artfully as this, all humanity takes a step forward.”<br />—
          <b>Rita Marie Johnson</b>, author of <i>Completely Connected</i>, and
          founder of Rasur Foundation International <br /><br />“Finally, a
          must-read book emphasizing the importance of emotions in manifesting,
          without losing track of the importance of thought in the process. Dr.
          Dean deftly explains the role feelings play in manifesting our
          desires. While authentically using her own experiences as examples,
          Melanie clearly lays out the science behind how feelings work as well
          as how to adjust unwanted ones. She does this with a light touch in
          easy to understand language augmented by clear and fun diagrams.”<br />—
          <b>Paul Hasselbeck</b>, author of <i>Power Up Your Life</i> and
          <i>Heart Centered Metaphysics<br /><br /></i>“Now that I understand
          how my energy works, I pay more attention to my emotions. When they’re
          negative, I find myself pondering Melanie’s question,
          <i>Who do I want to be in this moment?</i> Then, I make my energy line
          up with the answer. It sounds simple, yet it’s an incredibly
          empowering way to have a lot of control over your life experience, no
          matter what is going on around you.”<br />— <b>Charlotte Shelton</b>,
          author of <i>Quantum Leaps </i>and professor of Leadership, Rockhurst
          University<br /><br />“Having the science-based explanation
          undergirding these centuries-old spiritual truths provides any seeker
          a solid foundation for why and how each of us is powerful creative
          beings. As a part of my practice in my own personal and professional
          life, I follow many of Melanie’s prescriptions, and they deliver!”<br />—
