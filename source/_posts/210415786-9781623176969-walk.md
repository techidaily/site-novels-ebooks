            >A transformative collection of essays on the power of walking to
            connect with ourselves, each other, and nature itself.</b
          ><br /><br />In 2010, Jonathon Stalls and his blue heeler husky mix
          began their 242-day walk across the United States, relying on each
          other and the kindness of strangers along the way. In this collection
          of essays, Stalls explores walking as waking up: how a cross-country
          journey through the family farms of West Virginia, the deep freedom of
          Nevada’s High desert, and everywhere in between unlocked connections
          to his deepest aches and dreams—and opened new avenues for renewal,
          connection, and change.<br /><br />While most of us won’t walk or roll
          across the country, the deep wisdom and insights that Stalls receives
          from the people, land, and animals he meets on his pilgrimage have
          profound impacts for each of us. He shares how walking deepened his
          relationship to himself as a gay man, offering deep and clarifying
          emotional medicine. He confronts the systemic racism, classism, and
          ableism that shape and reshape the communities he walks through. And
          he invites readers to become awakened activists, to begin healing our
          culture’s profound separation from the natural world.<br /><br /><b
            ><i>WALK</i></b
          >
          is for those who crave to feel and embody, not just know and study,
          their way through complex themes that live in each chapter:
          vulnerability, human dignity, presence, mystery, and resistance. With
          dedicated practices—like connecting to Earth stewardship, moving into
          vulnerability, and walking and rolling with intention—Stalls’
          <b><i>WALK</i></b> is an urgent and glorious call to slow down, look
          around, and engage with the world in front of us. It awakens us to
          what we miss when we’re driving by, flying over, and rushing past what
          surrounds us. It’s an invitation to move, to connect, to participate
          deeply in the world—and to dissolve the barriers that disconnect us
          from each other and the living Earth.

          "With a bold and honest voice, Jonathon Stalls invites us to walk with
          him across America. It is an important journey through a landscape of
          gender, equity, and discovery. In each meeting we learn who we are and
          who we might become. From sea to sea there are mountains with sticky
          spines, and deserts filled with people…and solitude."<br />—John
          Francis, PhD, author of
          <i
            >Planetwalker: Seventeen Years of Silence. Twenty-Two Years of
            Walking.</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>WALK</i> is a powerful invitation that shows us not
          just the gifts of walking, but what it means to be fully alive....He
          reminds us what it means to live with a whole heart, even in the midst
          of our darkest times, and how walking as an individual and community
          act—as a fundamental human right—can repair our spirits along with our
          minds, bodies, and communities.”<br />—Antonia Malchik, author of
          <i>A Walking Life</i><br /><br />“Jonathon and I have been walking and
          talking together for years. We walk and talk about strategies to
          create more walkable places, management approaches, dogs, love,
          relationships—everything....This book captures what Jonathon has given
          me over our hundreds of miles together: listen to your inner wisdom,
          lean into connections, and embrace your failures as a great teaching
          tool. <i>WALK</i> is not just a book. It’s designed to take its
          readers on a meditative journey to enable us to open our eyes to
          ourselves and each other.”<br />—Lynn Richards, senior VP of policy
          and implementation at Blue Zones<br /><br />“Stalls is an important
          walking activist and his book recounts the adventure of a
          lifetime.”<br />—Angie Schmitt, author of <i>Right of Way</i
          ><br /><br />“This book is for all of us who are ready to embark on a
          journey of practice toward walking and rolling to connect, to build
          relationships with ourselves and our people, and with intention to
          build trusting, whole, and full lives....Whether it is a journey to
          our mailboxes or the entire length of the continent—this book gives us
          tools to practice walking and movement to heal, grow, love, nurture,
          explore, adventure, fight, dance, and become our full human selves.
          Life at 1–3 mph is how we were intended to experience our world. We
          must move more this way to feel more and more alive.”<br />—Teresa
          Martinez, cofounder and executive director of the Continental Divide
          Trail Coalition<br /><br />“I’ve spent the last ten years of my life
          going on walks with Jonathon Stalls, so I am delighted that in WALK
          more people get to experience his warmth and brilliance too. May you
          feel what I do after every walk with him: more deeply and
          uncomplicatedly human.”<br />—Nadia Bolz-Weber, three-time
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author<br /><br />“In 2010, on a
          journey of self healing, Jonathon Stalls set out to walk
          coast-to-coast across the United States. That defining experience, and
          years of boot-level community work since, has honed his book into a
          trail guide to human connectivity—a veritable map of the heart.”<br />—Paul
          Salopek, Out of Eden Walk<br /><br />“Jonathon’s personal journey is
          the starting point of a robust community journey, accompanied by
          heaping helpings of warmth, empathy, compassion, and insight.”<br />—Michael
          McGinn, executive director of America Walks and former Seattle Mayor
