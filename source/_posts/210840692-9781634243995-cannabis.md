          Although prohibited in most of the today's world, cannabis and
          humanity have a shared history that extends far back into ancient
          times. Evidence of its role in the production of cloth and rope goes
          back more than ten thousand years. Its psychoactive properties have
          also long been known by humanity, and ancient man attributed a
          supernatural force behind such effects. Archaeological evidence of
          cannabis ritual use of cannabis dates back to 3500 BCE, and it became
          considerably widespread. Egyptians, Assyrian, Babylonian and Persians
          used cannabis in Temple rituals, and for medical purposes, as has long
          been acknowledged, . Although, it has generally been seen that the
          neighbours of these cultures, the ancient Hebrews, whose religious
          history was recorded in the Bible's Old Testament and the Hebrew
          Tanakh, rejected these practices. However, in 1936, a little known
          Polish anthropologist and etymologist put forth the controversial
          hypothesis that the Hebrew words, kaneh and kaneh bosm, identified
          cannabis, and had been mistranslated as calamus. This linguistic
          suggestion drastically changes the story of the Bible in a number of
          ways, but it seemed destined to be an obscure linguistic hypothesis,
          until 2020, when evidence from a 2,800 year old temple site in tel
          Arad, Jerusalem confirmed the ritual use of cannabis Among the ancient
          Hebrews

          "Chris Bennett strikes again! In his latest tome, he examines the
          latest incontrovertible evidence of cannabis usage in the sacred
          Jewish rites at Arad and integrates those into his examination of this
          holy herb as foundational to various contemporary faiths. A
          provocative read, to be sure." -Dr. Ethan Russo, author of Cannabis
          and Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutic Potential
          <br />
          <br />
          "Chris Bennett's latest offering, Cannabis: Lost Sacrament of the
          Ancient World, is by far his most focused work to date. Building on
          the formidable research presented in his previous efforts, Cannabis
          goes even further in demonstrating that hashish, without a doubt,
          played an important role in the religious life of the ancient Hebrews.
          The final nail in the coffin of the Kaneh Bosm debate, Bennett's
          scholarly book challenges everything we thought we knew about both
          Judaism and ancient cannabis use." -P.D. Newman, author of Theurgy:
          Theory and Practice: The Mysteries of the Ascent to the Divine <br />
          <br />
          "Chris Bennett's Cannabis: Lost Sacrament of the Ancient World draws
          together scholarly and archaeological evidence for the use of cannabis
          in ancient magico-religious practices in a balanced, comprehensive and
          accessible manner. In particular Bennett explores the influence of
          cannabis, and cannabis occasioned altered states of consciousness, on
          the Judeo-Christian traditions, especially its role in facilitating a
          sense of communion with the divine. This book is essential reading for
          anyone interested in exploring the entheogenic roots of religions."
          -Dr. Jack Hunter, author of Spirits, Gods and Magic: An Introduction
          to the Anthropology of the Supernatural <br />
          <br />
          "Bennett gives us another tour de force of the deep history of
          Cannabis, spanning diverse societies of the Ancient Middle East. The
          scope of cannabis ritualization in the past elevates its current
          status as a perennial sacrament. Bennett totally revises the notion of
          what were the "Burning Times." -Dr. Michael J. Winkelman, Editor of
          Advances in Psychedelic Medicine <br />
          <br />
          "...One of the world's leading cannabis scholars and historians, Chris
          Bennett continues to expand on this body of knowledge in this, his
          fifth, book. Cannabis: Lost Sacrament of the Ancients... a fascinating
          read and of great value to anyone who wants to know more about how
          intimately cannabis has travelled with and benefited humanity since
          time immeasurable." -Stephen Gray, Editor/contributor, Cannabis and
          Spirituality: An Explorer's Guide to an Ancient Plant Spirit Ally.
          <br />
          <br />
          "Chris Bennett has been easily the most important scholar of
          cannabis.... [he] has done the research to confidently argue, and
          maybe even prove that yes Virginia, the original tree of Life and the
          true Haoma/Soma of the Vedas and the Zoroasterae was Cannabis Sativa
          specifically." -Yoseph Leib Ibn Mardachya, "Cannabis Chassidis: The
          Ancient and Emerging Torah of Drugs"
