              >For psychotherapists and inner explorers, an expansive,
              multidimensional odyssey into the history, practice, and potential
              of psychedelic healing</b
            ><br /><br />Now that the stigmas against psychedelic medicine are
            finally lifting, there’s a lot of curiosity—and confusion—about
            these powerful compounds.<br /><br />How can psychedelics be used
            safely? What are the risks? Can they truly help heal the wide
            variety of conditions that has garnered such international
            attention?<br /><br />In <i>Psychedelic Revival</i>, Sean Lawlor
            invites you on a deep dive into the science, spirituality, and
            practice of psychedelic healing—a revival of both the first wave of
            pre-1960s research and ancient healing traditions with plant
            medicines.<br /><br />Join this respected author and researcher to
            gain a full-spectrum understanding of the possibilities and limits
            of psychedelics, including:<br /><br />• The Western history of
            psychedelic medicine and recreational use<br />• The
            millennium-spanning legacy of Indigenous plant medicine
            traditions<br />• In-depth chapters on psilocybin, LSD, MDMA,
            ketamine, mescaline, ibogaine, peyote, ayahuasca, DMT, and more<br />•
            Practical insights, from microdosing to psychedelic-assisted
            psychotherapy to transformative mystical experiences<br />• The
            shadow dimensions of psychedelics—bad trips, scientific
            stigmatization, inequality of access, and many other essential
            topics<br /><br />Informed by solid research and direct wisdom from
            perceptive firsthand accounts, Lawlor guides you into the
            psychedelic landscape, covering treatment methods, realistic
            benefits, and the legitimate perils psychedelics can induce. Along
            the way, he shares exclusive interviews with luminaries such as
            Michael Pollan, Rick Doblin, Camille Barton, Carl Hart, Jim Fadiman,
            Rick Strassman, Natalie Ginsberg, Sandor Iron Rope, and many
            more.<br /><br />Psychedelics have tremendous healing potential, yet
            all evocative modalities should be handled with care. To make good
            choices, we need quality information about the prospects and
            pitfalls of these emerging therapeutic tools.
            <i>Psychedelic Revival </i>is an invaluable resource for navigating
            this exciting frontier in Western healing.

          “If you only buy one book about psychedelics, make it this one. Sean
          writes with clarity and humility, a truly balanced and trustworthy
          voice.” —<b>Rosalind Watts, PhD, </b>clinical psychologist, founder of
          ACER Integration, and developer of the ACE model and the Watts
          Connectedness Scale for measuring outcomes of psychedelic therapy<br /><br />“If
          you’d like to understand the full landscape of the psychedelic
          revival—the good, the not so good, the absurd, and the wonderful—you
          could not find a better guide and a better guidebook. Separating the
          myths and the mistakes from the miracles is no easy job. Fortunately,
          Lawlor is a seasoned astronaut, a fine investigative journalist, and a
          wonderful storyteller. I don’t know a better guide through yesterday’s
          history and today’s labyrinth.” —<b>James Fadiman, PhD,</b> author of
          <i>The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide</i> and (with Jordan Gruber)
          <i>All About Microdosing</i><br /><br />“An exceptionally well-written
          and comprehensive description of the rich history and great potential
          of psychedelic medicines in psychotherapy. Bursting with vivid quotes,
          fascinating anecdotes, and engaging references to popular culture,
          this is a must-read resource for professionals or laypersons seeking
          to use psychedelic catalysts in their own or their clients’ healing
          journeys. This inspired, compassionate, and grounded book is sure to
          be an invaluable contribution to the psychedelic renaissance.” —<b

          >
          author of <i>The Way of the Psychonaut </i>and
          <i>LSD Psychotherapy </i>and cofounder of the Grof® Legacy Training,
          and <b>Renn Butler, PhD,</b> author of
          <i>Pathways to Wholeness </i>and director of Grof Studies Graduate
          Programs<br /><br />“Prepare to embark on a fascinating journey that
          transcends conventional boundaries. <i>Psychedelic Revival</i> offers
          a groundbreaking exploration into the transformative power of
          psychedelics and their potential to usher in a new era of healing and
          the collective evolution of consciousness. Sean Lawlor encourages us
          to consider the broader implications of their integration into Western
          culture, acknowledging the benefits, the drawbacks, and the need for
          responsible and ethical use and for drug policy reform. Whether you
          are a seasoned enthusiast, a curious skeptic, or someone seeking a
          deeper understanding of the psychedelic experience, this book is a
          must-read.” —<b>Rick Doblin, PhD,</b> founder (in 1986) and president
          of MAPS
