            "Sin" is not a recurrent theme that anyone has to live with, it is
            an analogy for simply making a mistake. No one is ever bound by
            "original sin," the "original sins." The fact still remains... we
            are our own savior. You and we together create a kind of life for
            each other. We, as a collective, guide each other to redemption, not
            to keep making the same mistakes, over and over again, which has
            been happening for far too long now. It's unfortunate that "sins"
            have become a perfunctuous, demeaning way of controlling how people
            can absolve themselves from creating a life that is filled with the
            absolute truth, of THE true reality we all are living in.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Self-absorption has become a plague all on its own. It consumes
            one's ability to see beyond all the metaphors riddled in wonderful
            books, such as the HOLY Bible, the HOLY Quran, along with the
            Menagerous Mahabharata. Sin is your friend, so to speak, because at
            least it tells you what you shouldn't be doing. Eventually, you
            won't have ANY friends who can relate to you as long as you get rid
            of sinning all together, because the majority of people are still
            making the same mistakes over and over again. That is one price you
            pay when you stop sinning. You lose the same friends and family who
            have stopped listening to their true self, their pure self which
            sits inside of their mind, inside their own head. A tiny star,
            unproportionately shining so bright it can blind some of those
            looking too closely at that person's soul and spirit.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Therefore, be sinfully mindful of sin itself for that is the only
            way that guidance is received, sinning. And once you become aware of
            the ill feelings sin creates within you, then you can truly begin to
            change each of those ill feelings into more of a neutral feeling
            then positive. It (sins) all is on the same spectrum of love and
            fear. All of it. It's all the same thing. On the spectrum of your
            reality. An emotional, often traumatic array of colorful experiences
            ready to be changed into another color. You just can't avoid it. So,
            head towards the colors. That is the only way to get past the
            emotional feelings and traumatic experiences. Trust in this design.
            The colors of it all, the feeling of it all, colors or not. TRUST.
