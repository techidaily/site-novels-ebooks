          Chronicling the practices, legends, and wisdom of the vanishing
          traditions of the upper Amazon, this book reveals the area's
          indigenous peoples' approach to living in harmony with the natural
          world. <i>Rainforest Medicine</i> features in-depth essays on
          plant-based medicine and indigenous science from four distinct
          Amazonian societies: deep forest and urban, lowland rainforest and
          mountain.<br /><br />The book is illustrated with unique botanical and
          cultural drawings by Secoya elder and traditional healer Agustin
          Payaguaje and horticulturalist Thomas Y. Wang as well as by the author
          himself. Payaguaje shares his sincere imaginal view into the spiritual
          life of the Secoya; plates of petroglyphs from the sacred valley of
          Cotundo relate to an ancient language, and other illustrations show
          traditional Secoya ayahuasca symbols and indigenous origin myths. Two
          color sections showcase photos of the plants and people of the region,
          and include plates of previously unpublished full-color paintings by
          Pablo Cesar Amaringo (1938-2009), an acclaimed Peruvian artist
          renowned for his intricate, colorful depictions of his visions from
          drinking the entheogenic plant brew, <i>ayahuasca</i> ("vine of the
          soul" in Quechua languages). <br /><br />Today the once-dense
          mysterious rainforest realms are under assault as the indiscriminate
          colonial frontier of resource extraction moves across the region; as
          the forest disappears, the traditional human legacy of sustainable
          utilization of this rich ecosystem is also being buried under modern
          realities. With over 20 years experience of ground-level environmental
          and cultural conservation, author Jonathon Miller Weisberger's
          commitment to preserving the fascinating, unfathomably precious relics
          of the indigenous legacy shines through. Chief among these treasures
          is the "shimmering" "golden" plant-medicine science of
          <i>ayahuasca</i> or <i>yajé,</i> a rainforest vine that was
          popularized in the 1950s by Western travelers such as William
          Burroughs and Alan Ginsberg. It has been sampled, reviled, and
          celebrated by outsiders ever since.<br /><br />Currently sought after
          by many in the industrialized West for its powerful psychotropic and
          life-transforming effects, this sacred brew is often imbibed by
          visitors to the upper Amazon and curious seekers in faraway venues,
          sometimes with little to no working knowledge of its principles and
          precepts. Perceiving that there is an evident need for in-depth
          information on ayahuasca if it is to be used beyond its traditional
          context for healing and spiritual illumination in the future, Miller
          Weisberger focuses on the fundamental knowledge and practices that
          guide the use of ayahuasca in indigenous cultures. Weaving
          first-person narrative with anthropological and ethnobotanical
          information, <i>Rainforest Medicine</i> aims to preserve both the
          record and ongoing reality of ayahuasca's unique tradition and, of
          course, the priceless forest that gave birth to these sacred vines.
          Featuring words from Amazonian shamans--the living torchbearers of
          these sophisticated spiritual practices--the book stands as testimony
          to this sacred plant medicine's power in shaping and healing
          individuals, communities, and nature alike.

          "People interested in indigenous uses of ayahuasca will enjoy reading
          this book. Author JMW shares&nbsp;what he has seen, heard and
          experienced during long years spent with indigenous Amazonian people.
          He discusses the dangers of sorcery even for those who do not believe
          in it, as well as the importance of keeping quiet about one's visions.
          He also discusses a jaguar-centered world view, in which jaguar
          embodies energy, and energy makes up the universe. JMW &nbsp;shares
          nugget after nugget of Secoya wisdom about how to work with rainforest
          medicines. This book is personal rather than academic, and its
          approach is "kaleidoscopic", but it is packed with knowledge,
          experience and respect for indigenous cultures. I will recommend it to
          friends."<br />—Jeremy Narby, author of<i> The Cosmic Serpent, </i

          his friends, has been dedicated to the preservation of biodiversity,
          indigenous cultures, and indigenous knowledge in the Northwest Amazon
          for over twenty years!&nbsp; His commitment is one fueled by passion,
          a deep understanding of why all humanity needs the rainforest and a
          profound respect for traditional ways of knowing. In this book
          Jonathon shares the spiritual perspectives of healers and traditional
          elders as well as his own body of experiences, alongside a compilation
          of the identities and uses of two-hundred-and-one Amazonian medicines.
          This books jumps off the bookshelf and urges readers to connect
          straight to the living heart of the rainforest itself. This book
          undeniably will be appreciated by researchers of Amazonian topics for
          years to come, as well as anyone concerned about saving the rainforest

          something—anything—to save this amazing place. He has a gift for
          evoking a sense of place and purpose, and the characters he meets come

        </h4>
        <p>
          Ethnobotanist JONATHON "SPARROW" MILLER WEISBERGER was raised in
          Ecuador and the U.S. He has collected over 2,000 herbarium specimens,
          including first-time collections of several new species. From 1990 to
          2000, Jonathon lived in the Ecuadorian Amazon among five indigenous
          nationalities, and was influential in the creation of three reserves
          including the Napo-Galeras National Park. He participated in the
          demarcation of Waorani territory and in groundwork that helped the
          Secoya people retain a significant tract of their ancestral homelands.
          He is the executive director of the Council for Cultural and
          Biological Diversity (known in Latin America as Fundación OSA),
          supporting rainforest conservation and cultural heritage projects in
          Ecuador and Costa Rica. He is the steward of Guaria de Osa Ecolodge
          (guariadeosa.com), a rainforest and ocean discovery and education
          center on the remote Osa peninsula, Costa Rica. The author lives in
          Guaria de Osa, Costa Rica.
