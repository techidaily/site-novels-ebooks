              >Meditation can be so much more than 20 minutes of tranquility a
              day. “With some initial practice,” shares Andrew Holecek, “you’ll
              bring a mind that is more present, open, sensitive, kind, and
              aware into every facet of life. Wherever you go, your wondrous
              mind will go with you.”</b
            ><br /><br />Mindfulness is everywhere—now widely considered an
            essential part of a healthy lifestyle, much like exercise, diet, and
            good sleep. Yet many of us who practice mindfulness wonder: Now
            what? If you’ve sensed the potential for something much deeper and
            more impactful than temporary stress reduction and calm in the
            stillness of the present moment, expert teacher Andrew Holecek
            offers an exciting, inviting guide for what is possible in the vast,
            transformative world of meditation beyond mindfulness.<br /><br /><b
              >With <i>I’m Mindful, Now What?</i>, Holecek reveals how the form
              of mindfulness many of us know is merely one thread in a
              time-honored and much richer tapestry of contemplative practice. </b
            ><br /><br />Here he presents an encompassing survey of the many
            dimensions of meditation—including paths for opening your heart,
            nurturing compassion, connecting with your body, expanding your
            dreaming life, and investigating the fundamental nature of
            reality.<br /><br />In accessible language geared for both
            first-timers and the experienced, Holecek shares insights and tools
            to help you develop your practice, stretch your limits while
            navigating the pitfalls, use “meditation snacks” to open new
            directions, and more.

          “<i>I’m Mindful, Now What?</i> is a tour de force of the varieties of
          meditative experience, both in formal sitting meditation and through
          meditation in action for everyday life. Based on those experiences, we
          are offered pathways that allow us to expand mindfulness into insight,
          awareness, and wisdom.” —<b>Joseph Parent, PhD,</b> author of

          ><br /><br />“A rare jewel of a book by a rare jewel of an author,
          scholar, practitioner, teacher, and humanitarian! Written in a clear
          and easy style, Andrew leads us on a tour of the wonders of the mind,
          which can be revealed through successive stages of meditative
          practice. Mindfulness, insight, metta, open awareness, reverse
          meditation, and the nocturnal practices are brilliantly laid out in a
          smooth and accessible progression. This book is perfect for people
          just beginning to explore their minds as well as oldsters like me, who
          have been stumbling in the wilderness for decades.” —<b

          you want to take your practice deeper and learn how to apply it to a
          struggling and chaotic planet, you would be hard-pressed to find a
          better guide than Andrew.” —<b>Dan Harris,</b> author of
