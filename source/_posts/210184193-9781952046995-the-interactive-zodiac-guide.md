          <p>
            The Saturday morning that I paused - at a sunny outdoors market's
            used-books stall to glance over the motley variety studied into its
            trays - and happened on a shabby old book among them - I had no clue
            to what it really contained: an uncanny, new, life-fulfilling code,
            with major results for its lucky readers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sometimes stark differences between human natures, I learned,
            can be predicted from a simple astrology timetable... just two
            planets combine to shape us. They are our closest neighbours in the
            sky above us. Venus combines with Mars to tell us that people are
            really their birthdates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The genetic combination of two parents can predict no personality
            pattern - their children far from identical in character. But the
            astrological combination of where two planets are positioned in the
            zodiac of the heavens above us on our birthday does predict a
            personality quality, I learned. The zodiac?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's the imaginary belt of the heavens in which are the apparent
            paths of the sun and moon and principle planets; and it contains
            twelve constellations and hence twelve divisions called signs:
            Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
            Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, Pisces.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in choosing the day to be born, is selected the character that
            we are for the lifetime we are starting. Maybe it's we who do the
            choosing before we leave "the sky" to start our lifetime on Earth.
            Or maybe our loving "upstairs Advisors" choose for us! Do premature
            births and late births become a little more meaningful with this
            understanding? Oh! it appears obvious that the physical health of
            motherto- be and of unborn child are the governing factors, but how
            much do we understand of the rôle of our spirit, and the rôle of the
            everlasting spiritual world, in deciding that we will come here at
            all... let alone exactly when?
          </p>
          <p>
            The old book contained sets of tables of 123 years, here extended to
            150 years, and tables of two planet positions in those years and
            many pages describing a vastly contrasting range of personality
            qualities. They showed a direct connection between everyone's
            birthdate and its unique personality for engaging with others -
            especially with a lover or partner but also with family and the
            everyday people in our lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            But far wider although less vital, than finding an ideal lover, is
            the natural curiosity we have concerning our forebears. We all have
            ancestors who lived in horse-and-wagon times, and in the days of
            embarking on precarious sailing-ship voyages to the other side of
            the world, who often reared families of twelve children or more.
            What was great-great-grand-mama's personality to cope with that?
            This book has a page describing her. You need just her
          </p>
          <p>birthdate.</p>
          <p>
            And far wider still, or certainly of wider impact on some readers'
            future, is the old book's value in you seeing into the character of
            a baby yet to be conceived and born. Do we get the significance of
            an old book enabling family-planning for children with pleasant
            personalities?
          </p>
          <p>
            So it became clear that steps should be taken, giving many out there
            the surprising info I'd stumbled on. Here was the ideal for easy
            reading: an e-book that's a breeze to follow on your computer
            screen, with lightning speed hyperlinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting on page 25, with someone's birthdate year between 1880 and
            2029, click on the print-line of the year. A few seconds later,
            after two more computer mouse clicks, comes the full-page
            personality and character description of a person born on that day.
