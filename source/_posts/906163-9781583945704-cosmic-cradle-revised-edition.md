          <b
            >An affirming and inspirational read for parents and grandparents,
            regression therapists and spiritual counselors, and anyone
            interested in near-death experiences.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Where was your soul before you were born? If your soul is immortal,
          did it have a “life” prior to birth? Did you choose your life and
          parents? Is reincarnation real? Elizabeth and Neil Carman, the authors
          of <i>Cosmic Cradle, </i>address these questions through interviews
          with adults and children who report pre-birth experiences (PBEs)
          <i>not</i> based on regression, hypnosis, or drugs. Instead,
          interviewees recall their pre-birth existence completely sober and
          awake.<br /><br />
          In contrast to near-death experiences (NDEs), which have been well
          documented to show us what the soul experiences after death, PBEs
          throw light upon our lives before birth. People with NDEs sense that
          they “return home” when their spirits cross to the other side. What is
          the nature of this place we “return” to? PBEs suggest that we come
          from the same place we return to: we come from the Light and return to
          the Light. The same eternal "you" progresses through life before life,
          human life, and life after death.<br /><br />
          This new edition of <i>Cosmic Cradle </i>explores your soul’s journey
          into your mother’s womb—where your soul comes from, the origin and
          purpose of your life, and the process by which you entered an earthly
          body. In pre-birth communications, parents meet a soul seeking to
          cross over from the heavenly realm to human birth. Persons with
          pre-birth memories recall existence in a luminous world before birth,
          in which they preview the upcoming life with a Divine Planner, and
          recall how they journeyed to their mothers’ wombs.

          "Cosmic Cradle&nbsp;is such an enjoyable read and not just a dry
          esoteric or academic study. It is a beautifully crafted book with an
          almost universal appeal.&nbsp;Mothers will love it, fathers will be
          engrossed by it and grandparents will wonder at the cyclic patterns
          described by these young children."<br />—Peter J. Morris, alternative
          blogger, writer, researcher&nbsp;<br /><br />“<i>Cosmic Cradle</i> is
          a must-read for everyone who has forgotten the life of their soul
          before birth. A penetrating and insightful inquiry into one of the
          greatest mysteries of existence—where we come from, who we are, why we
          are here, and why we forget.”<br />—Joan Borysenko, PhD, author of
          <i>Seven Paths to God</i> and<i> Minding the Body, Mending the Mind</i
          ><br /><br />“Modern research into the nature of consciousness is
          revealing a consistent picture: consciousness is nonlocal or infinite
          in space and time. It is not confined to the brain, the body, or the
          present, as many have believed. <i>Cosmic Cradle</i> puts a human face
          on this research. This fascinating book will bring comfort to anyone
          concerned about our origins and destiny—and who isn’t?”<br />—Larry
          Dossey, MD, author of <i>The One Mind, Reinventing Medicine,</i> and
          <i>Healing Words</i><br /><br />“<i>Cosmic Cradle</i> gives me chills
          of recognition. This book is the truth. And I found it both an
          affirmation and huge inspiration.”<br />—Christiane Northrup, MD,
          author of <i>The Wisdom of Menopause</i> and
          <i>Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom</i><br /><br />“I love the concept
          of <i>Cosmic Cradle.</i> It relates most completely to the unequivocal
          reality of reincarnation, an essential understanding of life.
          Pre-birth memories and memories of previous incarnations continue to
          help us understand our complex Cosmos.”<br />—C. Norman Shealy, MD,
          PhD, author of <i>Energy Medicine</i><br /><br />“<i>Cosmic Cradle</i>
          is a stunning achievement, comprehensive in scope, spiritually
          illuminating! In one stroke the authors have succeeded in lifting out
          of obscurity a world literature—ignored during the recent era of
          scientific materialism—representing virtually all cultures and
          religions from ancient to contemporary times.… This work of
          encyclopedic proportions is the rare fruit of forty years of
          passionate and scholarly exploration of human consciousness, the
          neglected<br />stepchild of twentieth-century psychology. Elizabeth
          and Neil Carman have thrown open a golden door.”<br />—David B.
          Chamberlain, PhD, author of
          <i
            >Windows to the Womb: Revealing the Conscious Baby from Conception
            to Birth</i

            >Cosmic Cradle</i
          >
          gives us a wider lens through which to view the questions every child
          asks—where did I come from and how did I get here?
          <i>Cosmic Cradle</i> is fruitful reading for couples planning to have
          a child, for parents, and family life educators. Thank you Elizabeth
          and Neil Carman for compiling this tome!”<br />—Jeannine Parvati

          and author of <i>Hygieia: A Woman’s Herbal and Prenatal Yoga</i> and
          <i>Natural Childbirth</i><br /><br />“An extraordinary research work,
          yielding a quasi-encyclopedic treasury of evidence for the soul’s
          preexistence. <i>Cosmic Cradle</i> makes it clear that pre-birth
          communication has been known and recorded throughout history and
          across cultures worldwide.”<br />—Elisabeth Hallett, author of S<i

          >
          and<i> Soul Trek: Meeting Our Children on the Way to Birth</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Cosmic Cradle</i> points out that the individual must
          search for the fulfillment of his own truth and depend upon that for
          his illumination. Cosmic Cradle is marvelous, a rare privilege, a
          tremendous teaching.… It opened new vistas and new horizons. It is a
          work of illumination. Thank you for the great opportunity to expand my
          consciousness.”<br />—Murshida Vera Justin Corda, PhD, founder of New
          Age Sufi Schools, author of <i>Cradle in Heaven</i> and
          <i>Holistic Child Guidance</i><br /><br />“<i>Cosmic Cradle</i> offers
          an extraordinary collection of stories shared by families who
          experienced pre-birth memories and communication from both the
          parent’s and the baby’s points of view. Their portrayals of the
          incarnation process from spirit to human realms are supported in
          the<br />book by the timeless understandings nearly every culture has
          had—that we are conscious spiritual beings coming into human life with
          purpose and design. We are at a tipping point in Western thought,
          moving from Newtonian views into a consciousness-based understanding
          of our core<br />spiritual nature. <i>Cosmic Cradle</i> inspires us
          forward into the new, yet ancient wisdom of that core nature at the
          beginning of life.”<br />—Wendy Anne McCarty, PhD, RN, author of
          <i
            >Welcoming Consciousness: Supporting Babies’ Wholeness from the
            Beginning of Life</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Cosmic Cradle</i> is a global mind transformer. Not
          only is it a masterpiece in how it is written with such clarity,
          interest, and organization, but the scope of its contents is pointedly
          destined to change our ideas about life. The evidence is stacked up
          too high in this book to dismiss its message of the soul’s
          immortality.”<br />—Susan Herzberger, author of
          <i>On Becoming Enlightened</i><br /><br />“I was amazed at the breadth
          and depth of the information which this book contains. It elevated my
          understanding of the subject to an entirely new level, and
          revolutionized my ideas, not only about the consciousness level of the
          in-utero baby but the extent to which mother and child can communicate
          and interact.”<br />—John W. Sloat, host of www.beyondreligion.com and
          author of <i>A Handbook for Heretics</i><br /><br />"Beauty, poetry,
          clarity: authentic convincing research." <br />—Reverend Lucille M.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Elizabeth Carman and Neil Carman have spent more than 45 years
          studying and practicing ways of helping the Earth to be a healthier,
          happier place. Combined, their efforts have spanned into the realms of
          social work and environmental protection. In the 1970s, Elizabeth
          Carman worked with minority families and did social service work in
          adoption and foster care. She later spent years teaching inner
          development courses and meditation. Prebirth research began in 1989
          when she conducted interviews with mothers who were more in touch with
          their intuition. In 2002, Elizabeth received an honorary PhD for her
          research published in&nbsp;<i
            >Cosmic Cradle: Souls Waiting in the Wings for Birth</i
          >.<br /><br />Neil Carman's love of nature led him to obtain advanced
          degrees including a doctorate in the biological sciences. After a
          research position opened his eyes to global pollution, he was led to
          pursue an environmental career. He taught in the biological sciences
          and also created a new university course on the growing evidence of
          how meditation techniques unfold our consciousness beyond what is
          generally recognized.
