            >Readers witness fictional company president Jack MacDonald use the
            wisdom from&nbsp;<i>A Course in Miracles</i>&nbsp;to transform his
            company and relationships beyond anything he could ever imagine.</b
          ><br /><br />Written in story form,&nbsp;<i>Miracle Minded Manager</i
          >&nbsp;approachably integrates the lessons author John J. Murphy has
          learned in both his personal and professional life since first
          learning about&nbsp;<i>A Course in Miracles</i>&nbsp;in 2008. Murphy
          credits the Course for accelerating his growth and prosperity and
          quadrupling his business revenues within two years, and now you, too,
          can benefit from the blending of lessons from&nbsp;<i
            >A Course in Miracles</i
          >&nbsp;and Murphy’s modern-day training.<br />
          <br />
          Jack MacDonald, president of TYPCO, is trying to transform his
          company. He’s hit a roadblock with unhelpful and defensive direct
          reports and ingrained systems of doing business that no longer serve.
          Unsure of how to continue, he turns to business consultant Jordan
          Mckay, who has helped Jack with management challenges in the past.
          Jack is surprised that instead of suggesting practical business
          tactics, Jordan encourages him to adopt&nbsp;<i
            >A Course in Miracles</i
          >&nbsp;to open his mind and let go of ego. Though at first, he’s
          reluctant, Jack and his wife, Judy, begin to follow the Course. The
          results are life changing.

          “<i>Miracle Minded Manager</i> is a manual on living a happy and
          purpose-filled life in business and beyond. We are in an age where
          learning how to forgive, to communicate effectively, to contemplate,
          and to change things for the better are essential for human growth.
          John eloquently uses storytelling to bring the reader into a world of
          a struggling and stressed-out executive. Using helpful conversations
          and <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, the main character transcends what
          used to hinder him and rises to the occasion of president, happy and
          stress-free. His happiness comes from within, extends to his family
          and out into his business life. The story is nothing short of
          miraculous but also extremely relatable and actionable for any reader
          to understand and apply. I see this book as the new
          <i>Way of the Peaceful Warrior</i> but for business and family. I
          highly recommend this book to business teams, individuals, and even
          families who want to bring more peace, collaboration and organization
          to their business and their life.”
