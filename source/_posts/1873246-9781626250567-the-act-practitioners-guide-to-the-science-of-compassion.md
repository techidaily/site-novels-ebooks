            Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is proven effective in the
            treatment of an array of disorders, including addiction, depression,
            anxiety, self-harm, eating disorders, and more. Evidence shows that
            mindfulness and acceptance exercises help clients connect with the
            moment, uncover their true values, and commit to positive change.
            But did you know that compassion&nbsp;focused exercises can also
            greatly increase clients’ psychological flexibility?
          </p>
          <p>
            More and more, therapists are finding that the act of
            compassion—both towards oneself and towards others—can lead to
            greater emotional and physical well-being, increased distress
            tolerance, and a broader range of effective responses to stressful
            situations. One of the best advantages of compassion focused methods
            is how easily they can be integrated into an ACT approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            An important addition to any ACT professional’s library,&nbsp;The
            ACT Practitioner’s Guide to the Science of Compassion&nbsp;explores
            the emotionally healing benefits of compassion focused practices
            when applied to traditional acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT).
            This book offers case conceptualization, assessments, and direct
            clinical applications that integrate ACT, functional analytic
            psychotherapy, and compassion focused therapy to enhance your
            clinical practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first book on the market to provide an in-depth
            discussion of compassion in the context of ACT and other behavioral
            sciences. The integrative treatment model in this book provides
            powerful transdiagnostic tools and processes that will essentially
            build bridges across therapies. If you are ready for a new, easily
            integrated range of techniques that can be used for a variety of
            treatment applications, this guide will prove highly useful. And if
            you are looking to build on your previous experience with cognitive
            and behavioral therapies, this book will help to enhance your
            treatment sessions with clients and increase their psychological
            flexibility.

          “This is the book I’ve waited for—a guide that melds acceptance and
          commitment therapy (ACT) processes with the transformative power of
          compassion. Values, defusion, committed action, self-as-context—every
          component of ACT is strengthened as we learn to access and use
          compassion.”<br /><strong>—Matthew McKay, PhD</strong>, coauthor of
