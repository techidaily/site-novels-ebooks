            >To <i>live</i> kindness is to express the essential Buddhist wisdom
            of selflessness</b
          ><br /><br />Through stories from the ancient Pali canon of Buddhism
          and personal reflections on modern life, Dharma teacher Kevin Griffin
          reveals the richness and multifaceted nature of loving-kindness or
          <i>metta</i> on the Buddhist path. Along with the other brahmaviharas
          or “divine abodes” of compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity, the
          practice of loving-kindness is not only a meditation technique—it’s a
          radical way of life based in wisdom, ethics, and compassion for all
          beings. As one friend on the spiritual path speaking to another,
          Griffin explores the human dimension of what can sometimes seem like
          lofty philosophy. What would it mean to be completely free of ill
          will? How do we love without clinging? Can we expand our
          loving-kindness beyond the human realm to encompass the Earth itself?
          And how does loving-kindness relate to the ultimate Buddhist goal of
          enlightenment? Through guided practices and illuminating explorations
          of classical texts like the <i>Metta Sutta</i>, readers are invited to
          deepen their understanding of a core Buddhist teaching.

          “A clear and well-sourced reflection on the classical Buddhist
          teachings on loving-kindness practice. Skillfully contextualizing
          these teachings for our current time, Kevin shows that they are as
          alive and relevant today as they were when they were first taught
          2,600 years ago.”—Sharon Salzberg, author of <i>Lovingkindness</i> and
          <i>Real Happiness</i><br /><br />“Kevin Griffin has written a
          practical and accessible guide on how to take loving-kindness and
          transform it from an idea into something we can truly live with and
          live by. This is a great support for practitioners in negotiating
          their experience of living in this world.”—Ajahn Pasanno, abbot
          Abhayagiri Monastery and author of
          <i>Abundant, Exalted, Immeasurable<br /></i><br />“<i
            >Living Kindness</i
          >
          is a liberating book, both for the intellect and the heart. Kevin
          Griffin is grounded in a deep understanding of what the Buddha taught,
          and he makes those teachings come alive with his personal stories and
          insights. <i>Living Kindness</i> is not just a guide to the spiritual
          path; it is also a companion.”—Wes Nisker, author of
          <i>The Essential Crazy Wisdom</i> and <i>Buddha’s Nature</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Living Kindness</i> is a delightful, inspiring, and
          profound book on one of the primary forms of love taught by the
          Buddha. Kevin Griffin’s decades of living with these teachings come
          through in these honest and insightful reflections.”—Gil Fronsdal,
          author of
          <i>The Buddha before Buddhism: Wisdom from the Early Teachings</i>
