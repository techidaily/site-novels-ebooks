            >COL (USA Ret) and bestselling author Gene P Abel lays out the truth
            about UFOs and offers readers a fascinating exploration of the
            existence of an intelligent extraterrestrial race in this
            exploration of sightings and their potential impact on the future,
            and security, of the human race.</b
          ><br />
          <br />There are few events that would be of more importance, or more
          startling, than if, in the near future, we found ourselves confronted
          by another intelligent race with abilities and technology far superior
          to anything that currently exists on Earth. In
          <i>What, If Anything, Is Out There?</i> Gene P. Abel, COL (USA Ret.),
          details historic events that may well have been sightings by our
          ancestors and begins to explore what these encounters could mean for
          our security in the future. Drawing upon his years of military
          experience, Abel offers a unique insiderâ€™s perspective as he guides
          readers through a thoughtful history into the Roswell incident of 1947
          and beyond.<br />
          <br />In the wake of the Department of Defense acknowledgement that
          the US Navy has encountered UFOs, and in a moment where sightings are
          on the rise, <i>What If Anything, Is Out There</i> is a timely, and
          much-needed, look at the role of intelligent life in the universe.
