            >Explores ancient Jewish beliefs in life after death as well as
            contemporary spiritual experiences</b
          ><br /><br />• Reveals clear references to the afterlife, heaven, and
          spiritual encounters in ancient Hebrew texts, including the Torah, the
          Zohar, and the Dead Sea Scrolls<br /><br />• Shares profound stories
          from the author’s clinical therapy practice to show how afterlife
          beliefs can heal destructive emotional patterns and ancestral
          trauma<br /><br />• Describes the psychological parameters of trauma
          resolution, enabling long-term healing and spiritual advancement<br /><br />Exploring
          afterlife theories from the ancient world as well as contemporary
          afterlife encounters, Carla Wills-Brandon, Ph.D., reveals references
          to Jewish mysticism and afterlife encounters in ancient Hebrew texts,
          including the Torah, the Talmud, the Zohar, the Dead Sea Scrolls, and
          the writings of the early Kabbalists. She shows how these works
          describe not only the realms of heaven but also near-death experiences
          (NDEs), after-death contact, reincarnation, and deathbed visions of
          crossed-over loved ones. Drawing on her background in psychology and
          her experience as a licensed therapist, she explains how acknowledging
          an afterlife as well as spiritual encounters can help you find peace
          after loss, discover inner spiritual light, and heal from destructive
          emotional patterns and ancestral trauma, including intergenerational
          wounds such as those from the Holocaust.<br /><br />Sharing profound
          accounts of modern-day premonitions, spirit visitations, dream
          encounters with the dying, NDEs, and other psychic manifestations, the
          author shows how similar our contemporary mystical experiences are to
          those of our ancestors. Looking at the strong emotional resonances
          created by unresolved trauma, she explains how many survivors of World
          War II developed PTSD, which has been passed down from one generation
          to the next. She shows how believing in life after death and speaking
          about spiritual experiences can help heal emotional trauma and release
          difficult memories stuck psychically in our personal and ancestral
          past. <br /><br />Revealing how spiritual seekers can benefit not only
          from a belief in the afterlife but also from expressing their visions
          of the unseen, the author shows how knowing that physical death is not
          final fosters a healthier preparation for one’s own death and the
          deaths of those we cherish as well as a more fulfilling life.

          “Profound, well-researched, and elegantly written. In this riveting
          narrative, Wills-Brandon shares stories of holocaust survivors, which
          must be told, and through these compelling stories she dispels the
          misconception that Judaism does not embrace the concept of an
          afterlife. Rather, <i>Seven Heavens</i> demonstrates how Judaism has
          actually chronicled near-death experiences and after-death
          communication for thousands of years. It is destined to become an
          authoritative classic in the realm of near-death-experience
          literature.”
