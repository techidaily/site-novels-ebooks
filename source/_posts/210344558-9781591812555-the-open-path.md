          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Interest in nondual awareness as the essence of spiritual awakening is
          rapidly expanding throughout the Western world. Those who follow
          spiritual paths, such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Sufism, and Kabbalism,
          often come up against a kind of ceiling due to their religion’s
          cultural context or a belief system that places awakening beyond the
          reach of adherents.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          For years, Elias Amidon has helped seekers break through their
          blockages with his nine-month Open Path trainings conducted all over
          the world. In <i>The Open Path</i>, Amidon shares the lessons and
          exercises of these trainings. It is a guide to the realization of the
          silent ground of all being, and to expressing that realization in your
          daily life.

          “Among many mysteries explored here: spontaneous prayer, kindness,
          emptiness, starting from where you are, the freedom of the universe,
          awakening, is one that Elias Amidon barely mentions — friendship.
          Moving through this book feels to me like a continuously opening
          friendship." -Coleman Barks, The Essential Rumi
