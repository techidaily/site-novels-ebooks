            spoken word and the power of the vibrations that resinate from your
            words. You will learn how to use affirmations to achieve&nbsp;your
            goals in life. I cast light upon the power of prayer and its energy
            beneifts to all who believe. I make clear how energy can cause
            wellness or illness in your body and how to clear&nbsp;the negative
            energy contibuting to health issues. I will show you how the
            messages that the Universe sends us will keep you on the right path.
            I discuss the angels and offer true life stories of their existance,
            and how they assit us while on our life's journey. Throughout this
            book I share many life lessons aquired along the way. I am confident
            that the information&nbsp;that I share in these pages will bring
            happiness, properity&nbsp;and a more fullfilled life to all who read
            and use the energy&nbsp;as it was intended.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As you learn to work with the Universal Energy,
            you will begin to realize the power this energy holds. You will
            understand that as humans, we posses much more ability than many of
            us may have realized or are utilizing.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have the strength and the capability as
            individuals and as the collective to change the energy here on this
            planet, As more and more poeple begin working with the Universal
            Energy and projecting positive vibrations, our lives and our
            surroundings will shine more brightly for us as a people. We
            actually have an opportunity to make a difference&nbsp;in a this
            vast Universe with our good energy vibrations. Now that's big!&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe there is more to our purpose here on earth
            than&nbsp;you once thought. We, as the Universal Energy pioneers,
            must think of the possibiblites that lie ahead and how that energy
            will benefit our future generations. Our&nbsp;good energy travels
            out into the Universe,only to be returned us tenfold. Good
            vibrations create more good vibrations. it's infectious! All of the
            good vibrations that&nbsp;we send out, the Unvierse naturally
            bounces back to us. It's as the old saying goes, " You only get what
            you give."
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The returning energy creates harmony and balance
            for all of us who project good energy. The planet earth receives the
            good vibes&nbsp;too, and will balance itself. Bonus!
          </p>
          <p>
            We thrive in peace and harmony. This is why it is important for you
            to learn about Universal Energy and how to use it. This gift is for
            your benefit, and for all the others that will follow.
          </p>
          <p>May the Lord Bless you with his energy.</p>
