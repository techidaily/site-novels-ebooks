            Deborah Heneghan was fifteen when her seventeen-year-old sister died
            of cancer. A few weeks later, she woke in the middle of the night to
            a faint whisper summoning her. That was the beginning of Heneghan’s
            communication with her dead sister, one that continues to this day.
          </p>

            In <i>Closer Than You Think</i>, Heneghan shows how she began to
            recognize the signs and messages from her sister. She shows readers
            how to get back in touch with deceased loved ones and find guidance
            and a helping hand from their big-picture perspective in the beyond.

          "Once in a while a sleeper sneaks in - a book so unique it cannot be
          categorized. <i>Closer Than You Think</i> is just such a book. No,
          this is not the usual grief book on how to handle the death of a loved
          one. It is not even one of those stories about an individual on this
          side of the curtain channeling what a loved one says from "the other
          side." Such books have real value, but this one has more. Way more.
          Weaving all kinds of stories in and through her own, Deborah Heneghan
          covers every aspect of death and dying, life and living in a
          heart-filled, uplifting, and totally unique and wonderful way. What
          she has created is a caring and compassionate guidebook like nothing
          else I've ever read. She's done us a favor. She's opened up our hearts
          with this book. . . so we could see what's inside." -<b
