          Death hounds, shape shifters, and vampires are among the patients
          treated by the Holmes-like Dr. Taverner and his assistant Dr. Rhodes
          in this work of supernatural fiction by acclaimed spiritualist and
          occult writer Dion Fortune.First published in 1926, the adventures of
          Dr. Taverner and Dr. Rhodes take readers across the marshy moonlit
          fields of nightfall, hunting spirits and keeping watch over souls.
          Suffering from vampirism? Being stalked by a death hound? Haunted by
          past life debts? Family under a suicidal curse? From across the
          countryside patients and their desperate families come to seek
          treatment for unconventional diseases from an unconventional doctor.
          His secret? Treating the diseases of the occult.Though Fortune wrote
          The Secrets of Doctor Taverner as her first novel, she maintained that
          all the events were based on true occurrences. Many believe Taverner
          to be Fortune's own spiritual teacher, Dr. Moriarty, and Rhodes to be
          based on Fortune herself.An essential and fun read for anyone
          interested in the Western Mystery Tradition, Dion Fortune, the melding
          of medicine and magic, or just good old-fashioned paranormal fiction.

          "Originally a series of ten short stories, this subsequent compilation
          became Dion Fortune's first novel. It began her tradition of using
          fiction as a teaching tool. She claimed that the tales were based on
          real occurrences and many believe it is an account of her relationship
          with her own metaphysical mentor. Whether it is fact or fiction is
          irrelevant. It's a classic paranormal adventure story, recounted by
          one of the pillars of the Western Mystery Tradition. In her foreword,
          Diana Paxson puts the book into the context of supernatural literary
          history for us. She also likens Fortune's genius doctor to both Harry
          Potter and Sherlock Holmes. The book remains timely and fun, and
          Fortune remains one of the great metaphysical communicators." -Anna

          the Western Mystery Tradition. She was also a member of the Order of
          the Golden Dawn, whose members included at various times such people
          as A.E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, and W.B. Yeats.Diana L. Paxson has
          been teaching classes and leading rituals on trance work for more than
          twenty years. She is the co-author, along with Marion Zimmer Bradley,
          of Priestess of Avalon and has continued the immensely popular Mists
          of Avalon series on her own.
