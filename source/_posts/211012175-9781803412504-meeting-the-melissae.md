            The Eleusinian Mysteries were the most prestigious initiation of the
            ancient world. The ritual’s secrets were protected by death vows and
            have been speculated about for more than 4,000 years. The nine-day
            festival was run by a group of women called Melissae, or “bees”:
            married women, second only in rank to the Priestess of Athena
            Polias, who presided over Athens. They amassed incredible wealth,
            fame, and political status. Temple accounts from the period reveal
            that it was the priestesses’ money that paid for Greece's glorious
            architecture. Fees were earned for sacrifices and granting access to
            divinity. In return, the priestess made Greece a magnificent place
            to live. Oracles, diviners, soul midwives and creatrixes of
            innumerable festivals, these women ensured that the city-state kept
            favour with the goddess. They achieved that by emulating the ways of
            the world’s most successful matriarchal community, a bee colony.
            Herbal textbooks speak of a relationship between these women and the
            Lemon Balm herb (Melissa officinalis). Journey into the past and
            into the enchanting dreamscape of the hive with aromatherapist
            Elizabeth Ashley. A delightful odyssey for anyone interested in
            herbal wisdom, ancient Greek history, female empowerment, and
            humankind’s greatest allies, the bees.

          This book is a gem… a fascinating glimpse into the intriguing world of
          the MELISSAE an ancient and shamanic lineage of Bee priestesses linked
          to the god Demeter. Elizabeth Ashley leads us into a living world of
          ritual, sound and scent, which will delight anyone with an interest in
          plants and essential oils but also their links with mythology and
          history. Each chapter reveals secrets and mysteries, and the
          realisation that the wise Melissae along with the Bees still have much
          to teach and inspire us… I urge you to read this book, as I did, on a
          summer’s afternoon, amidst the dreamy sound of bees and the sweet
          smell of Lemon Balm, I can promise, you won't be disappointed.
