            Your birth chart is a snapshot of the sky taken at the moment and
            place of your birth, one that reflects your character, personality,
            strengths, and challenges. But the moment after that picture was
            taken, the planets moved on--some quickly, some very slowly.
            Astrologers call the moving planets "transits," and by comparing
            their movements to your birth chart you can gain a complete view of
            how best to prepare for challenges, meet opportunities, and stay
            grounded in a constantly-changing world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Astrological Transits</i>, astrologer April Elliott Kent will
            guide you through the best ways to make the most of your birth
            chart. Learn how to make the most of good transits and harness and
            transform the energy of "bad" ones. You'll also understand planetary
            cycles and anticipate your own transits. Finally, you'll know how to
            read planetary return charts, work with planetary retrogrades, and
            use eclipses to recognize major patterns and turning points in your
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are comfortable reading a birth chart, you are ready to move
            your chart into the future using transits. Instructions, tables, and
            worksheets will make tracking your transit cycles simple and
            exciting!

          "April Elliott Kent is one of only a few authors who make the ancient
          art of astrology fun and easy to understand. Her most recent book,
          Astrological Transits, will tremendously help the new astrologer make
          sense of the often-complicated study of planetary cycles. Ms. Kent's
          writing is concise with a heavy dose of humor, which makes it an easy
          read. Well done!" - <i><b>Susie Cox, astrologer and author</b></i>

          "The best astrology cookbooks are those that get our own imaginations
          cooking. <i>Astrological Transits</i> does this so well, it ought to
          be on every student's shelf. Kent makes the intricacies of reading
          transits accessible and fun. Laced with the reassuring common sense of
          her years of actual practice, it's also thorough enough to teach you
          everything you need to know about interpreting past, current, and
          future skies. Yet the real delight is the author's witty and
          insightful take on the factors. Even after twenty years of being an
          astrologer, I know there will be many future moments when I'll look at
          a chart, my mind will go blank, and I'll genuinely wonder, "What
          <i>does</i> Saturn transiting the 4th house mean?" That's when I'll
          jump for my copy of <i>Astrological Transits</i>." -

          "Hands down, this is the best book I've read about planetary cycles.
          In <i>Astrological Transits</i>, April Elliott Kent explains in an
          engaging, insightful, and user-friendly manner how the movements of
          the planets through the heavens stimulate changes in our lives.
          Furthermore, she shows you how to predict the types of changes you
          might experience, when to expect them, and how to make the most of
          them. You don't have to be a savvy astrologer to figure this out--Kent
          provides everything you need to decipher your own life cycles and the
          opportunities they present. Lots of charts, graphs, worksheets, and
          other visuals high-concept the key points to help you "get it"
          quickly. Examples of how transits have affected real people illuminate
          the importance of these powerful celestial periods. If you've ever
          wondered why your life goes through ups and downs, or you want to peek
          into the future to see what it holds for you, read this book." -
