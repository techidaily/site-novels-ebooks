          "Kathy deftly and expertly covers an amazing spectrum of healing
          modalities that guide the reader to the truth of who they really are:
          an eternal spirit living a human experience here on Earth. She helps
          the reader understand the value of living in the present moment, and
          the importance of letting go of the fearful storylines of the mind
          that would take us out of the present moment into the past or future.
          Kathy teaches us how we can live a Spirit-guided life filled with love
          and joy. Regardless of where you are on your spiritual journey, there
          is something within these pages that will speak to you and open your
          heart. Enjoy!"
