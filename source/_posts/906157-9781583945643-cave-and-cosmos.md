            >The pioneering author of <i>The Way of the Shaman</i> continues his
            exploration of universal shamanism in this “wonderful, fascinating”
            guide (Carlos Castaneda)</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In 1980, Michael Harner blazed the trail for the worldwide revival of
          shamanism with his seminal classic&nbsp;<i
            >The Way of the Shaman.&nbsp;</i
          >In this long-awaited sequel, he provides new evidence of the reality
          of heavens.<br /><br />
          Drawing from a lifetime of personal shamanic experiences and more than
          2,500 reports of Westerners’ experiences during shamanic ascension,
          Harner highlights the striking similarities between their discoveries,
          indicating that the heavens and spirits they’ve encountered do indeed
          exist. He also provides instructions on his innovative core-shamanism
          techniques, so that readers too can ascend to heavenly realms, seek
          spirit teachers, and return later at will for additional healing and
          advice.<br /><br />
          Written by the leading authority on shamanism,&nbsp;<i
            >Cave and Cosmos</i
          >&nbsp;is a must-read not only for those interested in shamanism, but
          also for those interested in spirituality, comparative religion,
          near-death experiences, healing, consciousness, anthropology, and the
          nature of reality.

          <b>Praise for Michael Harner and <i>The Way of the Shaman</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “What Yogananda did for Hinduism and D. T. Suzuki did for Zen, Michael
          Harner has done for shamanism—namely, bring the tradition and its
          richness to Western awareness.”<br />
          —from <i>Higher Wisdom,</i> by Roger Walsh and Charles S. Grob<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Wonderful, fascinating.… Harner really knows what he’s talking
          about.” <br />
          —Carlos Castaneda, best-selling author of
          <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> and <i>The Active Side of Infinity</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “An intimate and practical guide to the art of shamanic healing and
          the technology of the sacred. Michael Harner is not just an
          anthropologist who has studied shamanism; he is an authentic white
          shaman.” <br />
          —Stanislav Grof, author of <i>The Adventure of Self-Discovery</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Harner has impeccable credentials, both as an academic and as a
          practicing shaman. Without doubt (since the recent death of Mircea
          Eliade) the world’s leading authority on shamanism.” <br />
          —Nevill Drury, author of <i>The Elements of Shamanism</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Michael Harner is a great shaman. He also proves that a person can be
          both a scientist and a shaman.”<br />
          —Bo Bair Rinchinov, Siberian Buryat shaman<br /><br />"Michael Harner
          is the world's best-known expert on shamanism."<br />—<i>Parabola</i>
          magazine<br /><br />"Without doubt essential reading and destined to
          be a classic on the subject—just as much as his ground breaking Way of
          the Shaman, written all those years ago."<br />—<i>Sacred Hoop</i>
          magazine<br /><br />"A contemporary classic of shamanic studies."<br />—Nefer
          Khepri, Magickal Musings<br /><br />"<i>Cave and Cosmos</i>
          demonstrates with many examples of shamanic journeys from [Harner's]
          students that spirits really do exist and they want us to know that
          they exist."<br />—Riverdrum.com<br /><br />"<i>Cave and Cosmos</i> is
          likely the most important modern work on the perservation of shamanism
          and our renunion with humanity's original spiritual heritage."<br />—Marc
          Star, <i>New Dawn</i> magazine<br /><br />"Since the publication of
          <i>The Way of the Shaman</i> Michael has established The Foundation
          for Shamanic Studies and has been actively promoting his work through
          regular workshops and lectures. <i>Cave and Cosmos</i> is a relfection
          on a great deal of the intervening years research...It is a
          highly-readable and thoroughly engaging account..."<br />—Peter J.

        </h4>
        <p>
          The pioneering work of MICHAEL HARNER, PhD, brought shamanism to the
          West. In 1979, he and his wife, Sandra Harner, created the Center for
          Shamanic Studies, which later became the Foundation for Shamanic
          Studies, the world’s foremost shamanic training organization. In 1987,
          he left academia to devote himself full-time to shamanism. His classic
          books on the subject have been translated into many languages.
