        <div accordion-content="" id="description">Margaret Dubay Mikus, Ph.D. was a molecular genetics research scientist and taught college biology courses. After healing from multiple sclerosis in 1995, she began a poetic journal to "sing from the heart." "As Easy As Breathing: Reclaiming Power for Healing and TransformationPoems, Letters and Inner Listening" tells the moving story of her continuing healing through breast cancer. Using poems from her poetic journal, letters to her healing circle, and conversations with Spirit, Margaret takes the reader through a dark night of the soul and into the light beyond. This is about living deeply, healing body, mind, emotions, and spirit. She has already inspired many people to make positive life changes. Sometimes funny, always honest, graceful, and full of hope, this powerful, life-affirming book is particularly relevant in these troubled times.<p>WINNER OF A 2010 ERIC HOFFER AWARD (HONORABLE MENTION IN SELF-HELP/SPIRITUAL)</p><p>PRAISE FOR THE WRITING OF MARGARET DUBAY MIKUS:</p><p>"The multi-talented Ms. Mikus has a wonderful, magical, moving, humorous and inspiring journey to share.

She had just recovered from multiple sclerosis the year before and felt betrayed and abandoned by the news, calling it the dark night of her soul. Armed with the experience from her earlier multiple sclerosis healing process, Mikus integrated conventional treatment with her own mix of holistic therapies, including yoga, hypnotherapy, reiki, expression through poetry, and jokes, backrubs and hugs with her children.She attended seminars on healing, formed a healing circle with family and friends, ate healthy foods and exercised. Mikus eventually healed from the cancer and now dedicated herself to helping others discover their full possibilities for life....
