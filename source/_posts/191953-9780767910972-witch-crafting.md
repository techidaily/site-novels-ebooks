            >The author of Book of Shadows digs deep into the practices and
            principles of Witchcraft to provide a comprehensive guidebook that
            anyone—novices and seasoned practitioners alike—can use to
            incorporate the beauty and power ofWicca into their own daily
            lives.</b
          ><br /><br />Phyllis Curott’s first book, <i>Book of Shadows</i>, was
          an inspirational, spiritual memoir that chronicled her journey from
          Ivy League-educated, New York City attorney to Wiccan High Priestess.
          By inviting readers of all faiths to share in her own personal
          transformation, Phyllis debunked many of the myths surrounding Wicca
          and revealed it for what it really is: a spiritual movement whose
          tenets of Goddess worship and reverence for Nature were a great deal
          more accessible and familiar than she’d ever expected. <br /><br />Far
          from being just another mechanical spell book,
          <i>Witch Crafting</i> is the first book to offer readers not only the
          how-to of Witchcraft, but also the <i>why</i>-to, explaining the
          profound spiritual tenets behind Wiccan techniques. Filled with both
          traditional and innovative shamanic practices, Phyllis also provides
          an empowering new definition of magic and<b></b>reexamines the ethics
          under which Witchcraft is practiced, offering a groundbreaking
          alternative to the Threefold Law. With enchanting stories from
          Curott’s own experiences, <i>Witch Crafting</i> will also teach you
          how to:<br /><br />• Master the secret arts of effective
          spellcasting<br />• Create sacred space and personal rituals<br />•
          Perform divinations for spiritual insight and earthly success<br />•
          Tap into the power of altered states, such as dreaming, meditation,
          prayer, and trance<br />• Keep a magical journal and create your own
          Book of Shadows<br /><br />
          Rich with detailed advice for making magic, working with Nature, and
          finding the Divine within, as well as thought-provoking evaluations of
          this remarkable spirituality, <i>Witch Crafting</i> is the special
          volume that you’ve been searching for. Whether you are a beginner or
          have been practicing Witchcraft for years, whether you worship in a
          coven or on your own, <i>Witch Crafting</i> is the ideal handbook for
          you, or anyone seeking to unlock the divine power that makes real
          magic happen and experience the ecstasy, energy, and gifts of the
          Universe more fully.
