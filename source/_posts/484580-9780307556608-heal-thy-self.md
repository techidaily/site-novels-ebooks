          "Perhaps our real work, whether offering or seeking care, is to
          recognize that the healing relationship--the field upon which patient
          and practitioner meet--is, to use the words of the mythologist Joseph
          Campbell, a 'self-mirroring mystery'--the embodiment of a singular
          human activity that raises essential questions about self, other, and
          what it means to heal thy
          self."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />--Saki
          Santorelli<br /><br />Today we are experiencing extraordinary
          technological advances in the diagnosis and treatment of illness while
          at the same time learning to take more responsibility for our own
          health and well-being. In this book, Saki Santorelli, director of the
          nationally acclaimed Stress Reduction Clinic, explores the ancient
          roots of medicine, and shows us how to introduce mindfulness into the
          crucible of the healing relationship, so that both patients and
          caregivers begin to acknowledge that we are all wounded and we are all
          whole. His approach revolutionizes the dynamics of the
          patient/practitioner relationship. In describing the classes at the
          clinic and the transformation that takes place in this alchemical
          process, he offers insights and effective methods for cultivating
          mindfulness in our everyday lives. As he reveals the inner landscape
          of his own life as a health care professional and we join him and
          those with whom he works on this journey of human suffering and
          courage, we become aware of and honor what is darkest and brightest
          within each one of us.

          "Rarely does a book speak so eloquently to those of us who struggle
          with illness in our own lives, as well as to those who join with us in
          the project of healing. In sharing his involvement in the lives of
          patients and his own personal journey of mindfulness, Saki Santorelli
          gives us startling insights into what it means to heal and be healed.
          This book is a gift that will change your life." <br />-- S. Kay
          Toombs, Ph.D., author of The Meaning of Illness
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />"Saki
          evokes for us the mutuality of the healing relationship and reclaims
          for medicine and all who work within it the wisdom and power of its
          lineage."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />--
