                  wisdom about the importance of slowing down in our fast-paced
                  world, by the Buddhist author of

          ><br /><b><i>Is it the world that’s busy, or is it my mind?</i></b
          ><br /><br />The world moves fast, but that doesn’t mean we have to.
          This bestselling mindfulness guide by Haemin Sunim (which means
          “spontaneous wisdom”), a renowned Buddhist meditation teacher born in
          Korea and educated in the United States, illuminates a path to inner
          peace and balance amid the overwhelming demands of everyday life.<br /><br />By
          offering guideposts to well-being and happiness in eight
          areas—including relationships, love, and spirituality—Haemin Sunim
          emphasizes the importance of forging a deeper connection with others
          and being compassionate and forgiving toward ourselves. The more than
          twenty full-color illustrations that accompany his teachings serve as
          calming visual interludes, encouraging us to notice that when you slow
          down, the world slows down with you.

          Profound but relatable wisdom on coping with the daily grind—and on

          ><br /><br />“ ‘What I’m trying to do,’ says Sunim, ‘Marie [Kondo] is
          doing through a material and hands-on approach.’ When people ‘stop and
          pause,’ says Sunim, they ‘realize the state of their minds.’ . . .
          They can appreciate the joy that they are experiencing in the moment.”

          like haiku . . . sparingly but beautifully illustrated.”&nbsp; —<i
            ><b>The Telegraph</b></i
          ><br /><br />“[A] lovely, illustrated Buddhist guide to staying
          present. Reminiscent of <i>The Prophet</i> and worthy of a place on my

          ><br /><br />“I both cried and laughed while reading this bite-sized
          book of wisdom. . . . Sunim’s words are profound but familiar, simple
          but artful, and each chapter feels more like a conversation with a
          thoughtful, loving friend than reading another book on mindfulness.”

          grief that runs through our entire nation, just below the surface,
          everywhere I go. People ache for time with those they love, with
          friends and family, with nature. My hope is that everyone who opens
          this book will immediately find some passage, some way into a secret
          garden of slow time, where things of great beauty and truth grow, and
          blossom, in effortless abundance. It is a glorious refuge—a timely,
          welcome escape from the pervasive trance of ordinary, relentlessly
          productive time.” —<b

          ><br /><br />“<i>The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down</i>
          proves what the Wise have always taught:
          <i>As goes our attention, so comes our experience.</i> The more we
          attend to living in the present moment, the richer becomes our
          experience of it . . . and of our own higher possibilities.” —<b

          Haemin Sunim bridges East and West in his own life story and his

          unpretentious authenticity and compassionate engagement. In Haemin
          Sunim’s brief essays and aphorisms, the insights of Buddhism have
          fully become the stuff of life itself.”&nbsp;—<b
            >Robert Buswell, Director of Buddhist Studies, UCLA</b
          ><br /><br />“Perfect for readers looking for a respite from busy
          lives and tumultuous times . . . Sunim evokes a calm assuredness in
          his philosophy, reminiscent of Lebanese-American poet Kahlil Gibran.”
          —<b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b
          ><br /><br />“An antidote to the polarization that has gripped our
          waking lives: It’s quiet, meditative, radical in its simplicity, and
          organized into relatable bite-size chapters that will have you
          breathing easier and appreciating the small things in life. Few books
          have the power to pull us out of our indignant turrets and cynical
          worldviews like this one.”&nbsp;—<i><b>Signature</b></i
          ><br /><br />“Visually and literarily breathtaking . . . Akin to
          Aesop’s fables, full of simple truths . . . The aphoristic rather than
          affirmative content sets this book apart from others in the self-help
          category. . . . The verses look to the eye as lovely as they ring to
          the ear. The white space surrounding these verses emphasizes their
          simultaneous simplicity and profundity. . . . Sometimes the images are
          Chagall-esque in their metaphysical approach. Sometimes they’re
          Impressionistic. Always, they gorgeously represent the content on the
          pages. . . . Whether you are a fan of self-help, into Zen practice, a
          Buddhist, or none of those things, this book shows it’s all there for
          the taking: mindfulness, self-awareness, and a little daily peace.”
