            Monsters have been spotted everywhere, not just slithering under a
            child’s bed or lurking in the closet. Paranormal researcher
            extraordinaire Brad Steiger, an author of thousands of books and
            articles on the mysterious and unknown, collects some of the
            scariest, most unbelievable but true monster stories in his latest
            collection,
            <i
              ><b
                >Real Monsters, Gruesome Critters and Beasts from the
                Darkside</b
              ></i
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            From slightly demented humans to spine-tingling paranormal
            encounters, each outlandish occurrence is detailed with thorough
            research and recounted with a storyteller’s crafted voice. This bold
            telling of verified monster sightings taken from historical records
            and first-person accounts features: The British scientists’
            discovery of a tuft of hair in the Himalayan mountains containing
            DNA that cannot be matched with any known animal—the most convincing
            proof yet that Yetis are real; The “Mothman” sighted in West
            Virginia that some believe to be a harbinger of death; The monstrous
            creature, complete with horns and tail, that still lurks in the
            shadows of the Big Easy; The expectant mother examined by the
            strange praying-mantis entities aboard a UFO; and The couple walking
            near a lake in British Columbia, Canada, astonished to see a
            reptilian humanoid emerging from the lake's depths; UFO abductors
            seeking to create human-alien hybrids; Lake monsters, lizardmen, and
            creepy mermaids troll the waters for prey; Dinosaurs terrorize the
            jungles; Yeti and Bigfoot leave clues that they live in the
            mountains; Big cats, black dogs, and giant snakes prowl
            neighborhoods; And many, many more hair-raising stories!
          </p>
          <p>
            Highlighting news articles, historical accounts, and first-person
            interviews, this chronicle of human interactions with monsters will
            convince even the most hardened skeptic of the existence of the
            bogeyman, Bigfoot, shadow people, devils, mutant animals, swamp
            creatures, and all kinds of heinous beasts.
