            The reminders of the Ancients are everywhere. They are saved in
            remnants in archaeology. They are found in reminiscences in
            mythology. They are recorded in books, story, song, and stone. Who
            were these people, aliens, man-or-myths? Do we still see their
            influences today? What remains of these inhabitants of the jungles,
            lost cities, and dwellings underground, underwater and beyond? How
            did they rise? Why did they fall? Will they rise again?
          </p>
          <p>
            From pyramids and underground bunkers to watery graves and ancient
            astronauts,

            examines the archaeological evidence and the traces left behind by
            more than 70 ancient civilizations, including … Atlantis Göbekli
            Tepe Anasazi disappearance in the American Southwest Nazca Lines of
            Peru Turkey's Çatalhöyük Denisovan Ancestors departure Amazon Cities

            From ancient Egypt, middle America, and the Nubian Desert to the
            frozen Antarctica, underwater ruins of Asia, and clues of visits by
            ancient aliens, <i><b>Lost Civilizations</b></i> explores the
            unanswered questions about the true origins of man. Might there have
            been advanced civilizations long before the days of ancient Egypt
            and Mesopotamia? What do 3D imaging and new underwater mapping
            technology reveal? What do prehistoric artifacts, architecture,
            carvings, maps, and monoliths tell us? Were rising waters, erupting
            volcanoes, catastrophic solar flares, comet or asteroid fragments or
            some other unimaginable cataclysmic disasters the death of these
            advanced civilizations?
          </p>
          <p>
            Touring the world and reviewing the scientific evidence, this
            fascinating book ties together historical events in one part of the
            world that produced actual effects in others. Uncovering hidden and
            suppressed pasts of technologically and culturally advanced ancient
            civilizations, it looks at how modern civilization compares and
            contrasts to those who have gone before. It will leave you with the
            sense that what has happened to past advanced civilizations might
            very well be happening again in our own time! With more than 120
            photos and graphics, it is richly illustrated. Its helpful
            bibliography and extensive index add to its usefulness.
