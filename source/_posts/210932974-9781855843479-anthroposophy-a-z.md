          Rudolf Steiner's spiritual philosophy is the inspiration for many
          successful initiatives in the world today, from the international
          Steiner Waldorf school movement to biodynamic agriculture and its
          increasingly popular produce. Steiner developed his philosophy in
          dozens of books and many thousands of lectures. His teaching contains
          dozens of new concepts and ideas, and as a result he had often to
          create his own vocabulary. In this practical volume - a companion to
          his Anthroposophy, A Concise Introduction - Henk van Oort gives
          concise definitions of many terms and concepts in Steiner's worldview,
          from the most commonplace to the more obscure. Anthroposophy A-Z can
          be used as a reference guide, but also as a gateway into Rudolf
          Steiner's manifold world of spiritual ideas and concepts.
          Anthroposophy can be seen to be a new language - a language that can
          lead to the world of the spirit. It was with this awareness that Henk
          van Oort took the initiative to write this glossary. Ultimately, he
          has written the sort of inspiring handbook that he wished had existed
          when he first became acquainted with anthroposophy over 40 years ago.
          HENK VAN OORT, born in 1943, trained as a primary teacher before
          taking a Masters degree in English at the Amsterdam University. He has
          taught for 40 years in primary and secondary education, including
          class teaching in a Steiner school, teaching English, and running
          educational courses and seminars for teachers and parents. His
          interest in literature and poetry has led to his appearance at
          storytelling and poetry seminars, and his introductory courses to
          anthroposophy have proved to be highly successful. Based in Bergen
          N.H. in the Netherlands, Henk van Oort is married and the father of
          three grown-up children. He is the author of Anthroposophy, A Concise
          Introduction.
