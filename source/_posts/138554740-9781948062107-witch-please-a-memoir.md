              >A touching and thought-provoking account of how a&nbsp;woman
              explored a spectrum of religions—ancient and new—and ended up,
              unexpectedly, becoming a bona fide witch—plus a celebration of
              modern Wicca and witchcraft, spell books, broomsticks, holiday

            Misty Bell Stiers set out on a spiritual path to find a faith that
            worked&nbsp;<i>for her</i>, and accidentally became a witch. She
            knew the Bible well, and got to know the Torah and Koran. She
            studied Eastern philosophies, even the stories of the Egyptians and
            Greeks. Finally, after overcoming an immediate prejudice ("Um, no,"
            she writes as her initial reaction), she found Wicca.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Witch, Please</i>&nbsp;reveals what makes the mysterious religion
            of Wicca so desirable for more than a million Americans. In her
            witty, direct,&nbsp;and heartfelt text, Misty explores spirituality,
            perseverance, and finding oneself. She shares what Wicca means to
            her and what&nbsp;defines her as a witch; what she uses her spell
            book,&nbsp;cauldron, and&nbsp;broomstick&nbsp;for; the significance
            of Wiccan holidays, many about new beginnings; the surprising
            history of Wicca;&nbsp;and what kinds of witches there are. She also
            shares how in her busy New York City life, as a mother and a
            creative director, her&nbsp;faith grounds and sustains her. Her
            uplifting, you-too-can-find-what-works-for-you voice speaks like a
            best friend: relatable,&nbsp;honest, and encouraging.

            This unusual and beautifully written memoir explores what it's like
            to be a modern-day witch, and how it's changed Misty's outlook on
            life. It's candid, but it's also threaded with magic and has a
            warming, lightheartedness to it. Bewitching original drawings by
            Misty are throughout, and Misty even shares ten original recipes for
            her Wiccan holiday treats (including the likes of her cinnamon rolls
            and roasted garlic rosemary bread, sprinkled with magic and seasoned
            with love, laughter, and healing).

          “<i>Witch, Please</i> is very useful for beginners to know the
          experience and journey of a modern witch. Stiers’s experiences are
          universal for many readers, from falling in love and&nbsp;getting
          married to&nbsp;sharing her Wiccan faith with her family, having
          children, and experiencing difficult times and loss. Through Stiers’s
          personal experience you will learn about the gods/goddesses, symbols
          and tools of Wicca; spells and curses; living day-to-day as a witch;
          and Wiccan holidays (sabbats) with meaningful and delicious recipes.
          This book is very grounded, giving readers a hint of what life could
          be like as a Wiccan.”<br />

          “<i>Witch, Please</i> is a fantastic, enlightening read. Misty Bell
          Stiers’s personal journey working and raising a family in New York
          City as a modern-day witch is full of wisdom and wisecracks, but it
          never gets preachy. It reads like any good story should, like it is
          being told from one best friend to another.”<br />

          “Misty Bell Stiers dispels&nbsp;rumors about Wiccans and reveals what
          their beliefs mean in the modern era. <i>Witch, Please </i>is about a
          modern mom and her experience using the tenets of Wicca as her version
          of third-wave feminism. This book casts a major spell on anyone who
          reads it.”<br />

          “Misty Bell Stiers’s practical, conversational writing style is
          relatable and addictive. From the first line she pulls you in, opening
          our eyes to the simple everyday magic of connecting with others,
          understanding oneself, and the wonders of the earth and sky. In her
          understated and approachable way, she shares her journey with us as
          she finds her individual path of honest, spiritual growth.”<br />

          “Today, in a world that seems so unfamiliar to many of us, Misty Bell
          Stiers has gifted us with a book that shows that we can still follow
          the sun over the horizon, that we can inhale the crisp air that floats
          over glacier-carved lakes, and that we can wrap our arms around the
          sacred, wherever we may find it and whenever we open our hearts to it.
          The authenticity of her voice is only matched by her welcoming,
          lyrical prose—both weaved together to narrate and define. Misty gives
          us an intimate view of how to find magic in modern times, magic that
          has always been with us and inside us, and helps us find a familiar
          world again. It’s honest. It’s lovely. It’s magic.”<br />
