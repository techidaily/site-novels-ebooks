            There is a movement on the rise, one that brings the worlds of
            social justice and political activism together with the practice of
            witchcraft. Activists wish to add magical methods to their arsenal,
            while spell casters seek to use their powers to resist oppression.
            Written by an experienced witch-activist and with the current
            political climate in full view, the book shows readers how to learn
            spells for self-protection and body shielding, as well as methods of
            developing enhanced psychic intuition and situational awareness.
            Salisbury explains how and why to conjure spirits of defense, land
            spirits, ancestral spirits of activism, as well as your own personal
            guardian spirits. Included are rituals, spells, and sigils, written
            clearly and simply, so that even someone with absolutely no previous
            experience in spell casting can immediately feel empowered and join
            the "witch resistance."

          "I’ve been a huge fan of David Salisbury as both an author and a human
          being for quite a while now. His work in regards to both activism and
          witchcraft is not only highly inspiring, but David is one of the most
          authentic and dedicated human beings I’ve had the pleasure of coming
          across. David is neither an armchair occultist nor a keyboard warrior
          activist -- he’s someone who is always rolling up his sleeves to do
          the actual work both behind the scenes and on the front lines in both
          these areas.&nbsp;<i
            >Witchcraft Activism: A Toolkit for Magical Resistance</i
          >&nbsp;is a masterful blend of these two areas of Salisbury's
          expertise and passion. The book is a fantastic and intelligent guide
          employing strategic tactics of using magick to create much needed
          social change that anyone can operate, regardless of their magickal
          experience or skill level." --<b>Mat Auryn</b>, author of&nbsp;<i

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>David Salisbury</b> is a queer, vegan witch and a devotee of the
          goddess Hekate. As High Priest of Coven of the Spiral Moon, he teaches
          Wicca-and witchcraft-based topics throughout the mid-Atlantic region.
          The focal point of his leadership is an activism and service-based
          approach that seeks to expand the unique gifts that each person came
          into the world with. He currently lives in Washington, DC where he
          works to cofacilitate Firefly, a national Wiccan tradition and head up
          the Firefly House, the largest pagan organization in the mid-Atlantic
          region with nearly 600 members. David has been featured in the major
          DC media, including the <i>Washington Post</i> online (the video
          profile was viewed 82K times). Visit him at www.daviddsalisbury.com.
