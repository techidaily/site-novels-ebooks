            Are you fed up of living for everyone else? Want to live life on
            your terms? Not sure how you can balance a career, happy family
            life, travel the world and make a positive difference? &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>They Said I Was Mad!</strong> is a walk through what should
            have been an average life, but wasn’t... As a young woman, Donna
            Neseyif decided to step away from the norm and what was expected.
            Now a professional development coach and entrepreneur, Donna
            believes everyone has the resources within to achieve their dreams
            and her inspirational story will teach you:
          </p>
          <p>• The importance of building resilience.</p>
          <p>• What happens when you push outside your comfort zone.</p>
          <p>• How to live a life that resonates with your values.</p>
          <p>
            • &nbsp;How other people influence you and are critical to your
            success.
          </p>
          <p>
            • &nbsp;The key steps to bringing about change and achieving
            self-fulfillment and happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>They Said I Was Mad!</strong> follows the tremendous highs
            as well as deep lows of Donna's&nbsp;life from a challenging
            childhood to a successful corporate career, moving to a dusty
            African village, having a family and travelling the world.
            She&nbsp;thought she had it all, until one day, she hit rock bottom
            and faced a mental health challenge but ultimately this led to
            achieving success beyond her&nbsp;wildest dreams. In the book,
            you’ll discover how an ordinary person can, by thinking differently,
            push away from the expectations of others and, with a bit of hard
            work and a lot of clear focus, achieve extraordinary
            results.Throughout the story, you’ll find key learnings and steps to
            follow, but the&nbsp;message is that you always have a choice. We
            can settle for the life we have or do something different and make a
            change.
          </p>
          <p>
            You too can release yourself from the pressures of everyday life and
            take back control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many people meander through life without a plan, or they have a goal
            to do something different, without the guts to take action. I’ve
            known Donna for many years and in
            <strong>They Said I Was Mad!</strong>, she shares her personal
            story, illustrating dozens of experiences that many would never dare
            to embrace.The decisions she took have helped her to become the
            woman she is today and have had a positive impact on her family and
            thousands of others on her journey.If you’re in a place where you
            need to do something different and you know that now’s the time to
            do it, Donna will inspire you.

          Donna has written an excellent book here. As someone in a personal and
          business development role myself, I am inspired by her journey and I
          think I would like my daughters to read this book too!&nbsp;<br />I
          believe ‘environment dictates performance and you gain more experience
          by exposing yourself to new environments’. In this book you will
          understand the importance of a&nbsp;growth mindset, yes, we all have
          fixed and growth mindsets depending on the situation. A growth mindset
          makes identifying your own actions and how to make positive changes
          for yourself, and those around you easier. Donna has had such
          a&nbsp;diverse life&nbsp;experience, from the UK to USA, Asia to
          Africa and the journey goes on. She&nbsp;talks about how ‘giving, not
          expecting to receive’ is a fundamental truth of the joy of giving.
          There is more joy in giving than receiving and Donna has clearly
          demonstrated that in <strong>They Said I Was Mad!</strong>

          Life has its ups and downs, but for some the downs are far bigger than
          the ups. What gets you through these tough times has nothing to do
          with the outside world, it is all about what goes on inside your head.
          Donna’s journey is one in which she overcomes so much and learns the
          lessons as she goes. If you are struggling with your own journey then
          you will get inspiration from this book, and realise that you have the
          power to create the life that you desire.

          <br />I really enjoyed reading Donna’s story. It is inspiring and
          shows us that we all have choices in life but that to be truly happy,
          we have to be true to ourselves. In a world where we are expected to
          conform, it can be difficult to learn how to stand to our beliefs and
          accept the consequences of our actions but this is key. By sharing her
          journey, Donna shows us that the impossible can be achieved and that
          we are not defined by our backgrounds or circumstances.
