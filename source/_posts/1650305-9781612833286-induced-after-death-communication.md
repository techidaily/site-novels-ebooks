            Induced After Death Communication (IADC) is a therapy for grief and
            trauma that has helped thousands of people come to terms with their
            loss by allowing them the experience of private communication with
            their departed loved ones. This is the definitive book on the
            subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            Botkin, a clinical psychologist, created the therapy while
            counseling Vietnam veterans in his work at a Chicago area VA
            hospital. Botkin recounts his initial—accidental—discovery of IADC
            during therapy sessions with Sam, a Vietnam vet haunted by the
            memory of a Vietnamese girl he couldn't save. During the session,
            quite unexpectedly, Sam saw a vision of the girl's spirit, who told
            him everything was okay; she was at peace now. This single moment
            surpassed months--years--of therapy, and allowed Sam to reconnect
            with his family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since that 1995 discovery, Botkin has used IADC to successfully
            treat countless patients—the book includes dozens of case
            examples—and has taught the procedure to therapists around the
            country. This is the inside story of a revolutionary therapy that
            will profoundly affect how grief and trauma are understood and
            treated.

          is an authentic and believable story of Dr. Botkin's groundbreaking
          discovery of a new and very powerful treatment of grief. But even more
          than that, the book provides readers with a whole new way of thinking
          about and experiencing our relationships and our lives. The book
          offers hope and comfort, and a new kind of peace of mind.
          <br /><br />The book is written in a compelling style that makes it
          difficult to put down and leaves you hungry for more. This is not only
          a book for psychologists and psychotherapists, but for all people who
          seek to understand the meaning of life, and death." –<b
