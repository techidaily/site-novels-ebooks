            Can you imagine being in high school or college and suddenly
            learning you have cancer? You thought you had a lifetime ahead of
            you and the whole world at your feet, but suddenly you're told...
            maybe not. How would you cope?<br /><br />That's the question the
            twenty young people in this book had to answer when they were
            diagnosed with childhood cancer. <i>Perseverance</i> tells of their
            trials and tribulations, of their triumphs, and of the unique
            challenges that day-to-day college life brings them.
            <i>Perseverance</i> also provides an intimate look at the lives and
            journeys of these young people and how their courage and strength
            have affected the lives of others.<br /><br />These honest,
            first-person accounts lend amazing depth to the inspiring stories of
            these young men and women. Inside, you'll meet Zac York, who tells
            of climbing Mount Whitney—on crutches—after battling brain cancer.
            You'll meet Alex Oden, who—just days after brain surgery—gave his
            8th grade peers a graduation speech called "A Day Well Spent," in
            which he challenged them to make a difference in just one day.
            You'll meet Kristen Jones, who, while battling leukemia, was able to
            pass the MCAT and pursue her dream of becoming a pediatric
            oncologist. <br /><br />Twenty unique and fascinating stories, with
            one common theme: perseverance. The stories of these heroes
            demonstrate how anyone can learn to live with energy and passion,
            regardless of the obstacles to be faced, and will remind us all that
            now is everything. <br /><br /><br /><br />At the Publisher's
            request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management
            Software (DRM) applied.

          move you to tears, teach you to appreciate, and inspire you to
          persevere.” —Tal Ben-Shahar, New York Times bestselling author of

          puts a very human face on courage and strength. Carolyn and the young
          people she has worked with are an inspiration to us all.” —Gay
          Hendricks, New York Times bestselling author of The Big Leap and
          Conscious Living<br /><br />“With tremendous respect and grace,
          Carolyn Rubenstein tells the stories of twenty survivors of childhood
          cancer -- in their own words. Through these real-life tales of
          survival, Perseverance offers not only great hope to those battling
          illness or caring for a loved one but also profound insight for all of
          us seeking to lead a meaningful life.” —Daniel H. Pink, New York Times
          bestselling author of A Whole New Mind<br /><br />“<i>Perseverance</i>...is
          an inspirational story about the joys of living in the moment, courage
          in the face of extraordinary challenges and the power of love.” —<i
            >Publishers Weekly</i
          ><br /><br />“In <i>Perseverance,</i> Carolyn Rubenstein has
          passionately gathered together the stories of childhood cancer
          survivors, and I am humbled by their courage. These kids have managed
          to keep their ultimate goals in mind, to find the beauty in every
          waking hour, and to live to the fullest in the face of a terrifying
          disease. That so many have gone on to thrive in young adulthood is a
          testament to their strength of spirit and their indomitable nature.
          Everyone can learn from these stories and the lessons Carolyn has
          shared with us. Read this book and be inspired!!” —Jon Gordon,
          international bestselling author of The Energy Bus and Training
          Camp<br /><br />“With <i>Perseverance</i>, Carolyn Rubenstein has
          given us a powerful and inspirational book filled with amazing stories
          of childhood cancer survivors. This book will touch your heart with
          tales of hope, challenge, and survival.” —Marshall Goldsmith, Wall
          Street Journal bestselling author of Succession Are You Ready? and
          What Got You Here Won’t Get You There<br /><br />“The lives of the
          young adults in this book are monuments to strength, courage, and
          resilience. Carolyn Rubenstein has put together a treasure.” —Karen
          Salmansohn, author of The Bounce Back Book and How to Be Happy,
          Dammit<br /><br />“A beautiful and inspiring book. Each page is a
          gentle reminder that life is a gift and every moment should be
          celebrated and embraced with passion and gratitude. The lessons shared
          within these pages are not only for those of us who are fighting
          cancer but for all of us who struggle to live a life with purpose, joy
          and meaning.” —Sandra Magsamen, artist and author of Living
          Artfully<br /><br />“<i>Perseverance</i> beautifully organizes
          reminder after reminder that every moment is precious. As a long-time
          cancer thriver, I would not trade for the resources I was able to tap
          into by looking at the fragility of my own life.
          <i>Perseverance</i> serves as a tender wake-up reminder that the
          present is the future we worried about in the past.” —Marion Luna
          Brem, international speaker and business guru, author of The 7
          Greatest Truths about Successful Women<br /><br />“<i>Perseverance </i
          >demonstrates the practical application of <i>hope</i> in everyday
          life. Its true stories of cancer-conquerors will shed new light on
          what it means to overcome adversity.” —Kevin Milne, author of The
