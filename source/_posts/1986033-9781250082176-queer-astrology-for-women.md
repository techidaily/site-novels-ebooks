            A hilariously irreverent and startlingly insightful astrology guide
            for lesbians.<br /><br />Jill Dearman is a breakthrough astrologer
            for our time. No one has approached the stars with her sass and
            class ever before! Her guide to astrology for lesbians is lively,
            revealing--and naughty!<br /><br />Sections include: in life, in
            bed, how to seduce her, doing her and dating her, how to last over
            the long haul, how to get rid of her, and the three faces of each
            sign.<br /><br />How to get rid of an Aquarius woman: Ms. Aquarius
            will pack her bags soon after you start invading her personal space
            and drowning her in too much nonstop and irrational cemotion. Ms.
            Aquarius hates to feel trapped, so if you slowly take away all her
            freedoms, you will be watching her walk out the door faster than you
            can sing "This is the dawning of the..."<br /><br />The Cancer woman
            is intensely emotiona...and her moods change with the tides. Not
            that you can every completely figure her out. Would you dare to
            assume you could understand the sea or fully absorb or comprehend a
            beautiful piece of music? Or course not, you silly lesbian. So don't
            patronize this lovely woman.<br /><br />But getting rid of a Cancer
            woman: Please don't be a cad and pull off the old "I'm going out for
            a pack of cigarettes (or a bag of Kitty Litter)" and never come back
            routine. She'll have your mother sitting with her and holding her
            hand, worrying, before you've made it past the border.<br /><br />And
            a complete compatibility profile of each astrological
            combination:<br /><br />Take Aries and Cancer: The best par? They
            can be fiercely loyal and protective of each other. The worst part?
            They instinctively know how to hurt each other's feelings and often
            do, in a most brutal way. Ms. Aries, ruled by fire strikes quickly
            and forcefully and without thinking. "Don't each that doughnut!
            It'll make you fat!" Ms Cancer, ruled by water, knows how to create
            a mood of subtle emotional torture. "I don't feel like being
            touched...No, I don't want to be alone. Can't we just sit together
            in the same room and not talk and not touch and not make such a big
            deal about it?"

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Jill Dearman</b> has been a fascinated student of the signs and
          planets since childhood. She has written professionally about
          astrology for numerous publications since 1990, and is the author of
          <i>Queer Astrology for Men</i> and <i>Queer Astrology for Women</i>.
          The study of the stars led her to the study of human nature, and she
          worked volunteer or part time as an HIV counselor throughout the
          1990s.<br /><br />She is also a playwright, screenwriter, and
          filmmaker, with many lurid credits to her name. Her short film
          <i>The Great Bravura</i>, a magician's tale, has been screened at
          several festivals, and she is currently developing a feature-length
          version of the story.<br /><br />She spins her web in New York City,
          but in her frequent moments of pomposity, views herself as a "citizen
          of the world."
