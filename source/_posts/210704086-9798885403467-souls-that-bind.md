            Determined to shake living in her older sister's mistake-filled
            shadow and fresh out of high school, Chloe McKinney is eager to show
            her strict and overbearing parents that she is a responsible adult
            that can make it on her own. The only person she seems to have on
            her side is her grandpa whom she has always had a special bond
            with.When Chloe's homelife with her parents becomes unbearable, she
            plots a way out and applies for a job as a live-in caretaker to an
            elderly lady named Hanna Hutton. Chloe can't quite put her finger on
            why her new employer seems so familiar to her, as if she has always
            known her.One night, Hanna reveals a shocking secret to Chloe that
            she had lived a past life with the only man she ever loved. Together
            they made a beautiful life and family. Had it not been messed up by
            tragedies, she would have lived the most perfect life. Hanna seems
            trapped and saddened in her new life while wishing for her old life
            with her family back. She fears that once this life is soon over
            that she will be born again and live another dull life without ever
            finding true love again.As Chloe struggles with believing Hanna's
            secret, clues and jaw-dropping revelations keep coming up that may
            very well explain just why it is that her sweet elderly boss seems
            so familiar!While Chloe works to figure out the mystery of Hanna's
            secret, she finds herself also falling in love with the perfect man.
            Her newly found love makes her sad for her employer's lost true love
            and finds her wanting to believe the impossible. Can true love last
            forever? Could one be reincarnated? And if one could be, then
            couldn't there be more?
