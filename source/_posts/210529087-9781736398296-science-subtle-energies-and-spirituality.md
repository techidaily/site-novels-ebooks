            Subtle energies-does that sound too "woo-woo," not the province of
            real science? Yet behind the scenes, brilliant minds have been
            dedicated to finding out what lies behind what's apparent in the
            universe-and how this can enhance our lives and our understanding of
            who we really are.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Dr. Jerry Gin has had a lifelong passion for science, even founding
            businesses based on his knowledge of chemistry. But he's also had a
            lifelong calling to understand the workings of the universe. This
            has led him to wonderful adventures in science and spirituality,
            discoveries that turn our understanding of matter on its head. His
            research shows that we all have the capacity to sense invisible
            forces-subtle energies-which benefit us even more once we become
            conscious of them. Whether it's raising the quality of our drinking
            water . . . harmonizing the negative effects of electromagnetic
            frequencies . . . or dowsing to learn which foods, supplements, etc.
            are good for us, what we really end up discovering is that there's
            more to life-and to us-than we thought.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Science, Spirituality, and Subtle Energies welcomes us to this
            invisible-but-potent world, offering not just explanations and
            illustrations, but also hands-on exercises to experience subtle
            energies directly, as well as unique affirmations from Joachim
            Wippich to attune us to our highest (I AM) being. This book is
            grounded in the scientific view that we don't have to take things on
            faith but can find out for ourselves. Yet faith opens up, once we
            know who we are at our most essential level. We are creators; and we
            can create in harmony with the very nature of the universe-and
            thereby heal ourselves and the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This book has two primary purposes: to (1) reveal our connectedness
            and so help humanity advance, and (2) provide tools for
            investigating the hidden world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exploring some fascinating ideas and realities about who we really
            are, what the world really is, what our thoughts can create, how
            healing can come about, and more, the book's transformative premise
            is that we are one with the Creative Force in the universe-the I
            AM-and that our experience of the world can be one of balance,
            peace, harmony, and love.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Science: </strong>Most of us have been raised within a
            scientific paradigm (involving premises, experiments, and an "I'll
            believe it when I see it" attitude), so subtle energies may be less
            familiar. By applying principles of the scientific method to the
            study of subtle energies, we can receive valuable data and
            information as to the nature of who we are: our I AM essence.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Subtle energies: </strong>The study of subtle energies
            offers tools to study our vibrational-energy levels. Certain
            objects, certain states of matter, and magnets can create subtle
            energies in a space that are called subtle energy fields. This book
            teaches how to detect and measure them, which helps us come to know
            the I AM, the heart of our being.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            <strong>Spirituality: </strong>This book views spirituality<strong
            ></strong>in the light of the I AM-the essence of who we are, the
            energy and divinity that flows through all of us and
            everything.&nbsp;Once you understand the nature of creation, and can
            feel and test for your own vibrational energies, this becomes
            self-evident.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            When the understanding and embrace of I AM becomes the unifying
            thread of both science and spirituality, humanity will reach a new
            stage in evolution. Humans will create with the concept of harmony,
            balance, and love as the core principles of who we are.&nbsp;We will
            truly understand our connectedness.

          "'What am I? What is my purpose for living?' Dr. Gin answers these
          timeless questions with evidence for the invisible subtle energies
          underpinning our physical world. The beauty of his approach is that
          understanding the science of subtle energies gives us a window into
          our true nature. Subtle energies are the inherent creative principle
          responsible for human evolution and linked closely with
          consciousness.&nbsp;The tools presented herein lift the mystery of
          living and become self-evident. We are the source of our reality. This
          work gives credence to Psalm 82:6: Ye are Gods."-Dr. Nisha J. Manek,

          "We are at a critical juncture in our humanity. Jerry Gin's new book
          gives us an incredible gift at a time when we most need it-the insight
          and wisdom to understand that we are not powerless, but are powerful
          creators of our reality. Combining history, science, and math with
          spirituality to support an investigation of energy, Gin shows that we
          are not only surrounded by everyday magic and wonder, but in fact are
          practitioners of it by our very nature. All the tools and resources we
          need to live fully in balance and harmony with one another and the
          Earth are at our disposal."-Jane Majkiewicz, writeintuition.com &nbsp;

          "A traditionally trained scientist, Jerry Gin has had the all-too-rare
          courage to be able to break away from traditional textbook thinking
          about how the world works when presented with evidence or experience
          that challenges conventional perspectives.&nbsp;This book is his
          extraordinary journey through novel worlds.&nbsp;Hopefully you will
          come away thinking about things in a different way.&nbsp;I know I
          did."-Bill Bengston, PhD; author, The Energy Cure; President, Society

          "This unique book offers a vital vision for our times, reminding us of
          our miraculous Divine nature through the power of our thought, free
          will, and creation-which can make an enormous difference in our lives
          and the world, if only we would bring forth love, harmony, and
          balance.&nbsp;Dr. Jerry Gin's scientific and spiritual insight and
          wisdom inspires and shines through on every page. The book is packed
          with practical exercises and affirmations and invites the reader to
          greater empowerment and spiritual growth.&nbsp;It is easy to read and
          accessible to all."-Beverly Rubik, Ph.D., Biophysicist; President,

          "The path for a new stage in human evolution is clearly explained by
          this exceptional book. Dr. Jerry Gin uses a unique approach to address
          the connection between science and spirituality, providing us with an
          opportunity to better understand the qualities of subtle energy as
          well as the essence of 'I AM.' He presents his conclusion first, and
          then provides scientific evidence and tools so that we can confirm the
          information for ourselves. The added bonus of affirmations by
