            >Breathwork guide and meditation teacher Matteo Pistono offers a
            how-to book for upgrading your nervous system to live your optimal
            life physically, emotionally, and spiritually.</b
          ><br /><br />Do you want to calm your racing thoughts before lying
          down for a restful night of sleep? Or raise your energy levels before
          your morning exercise or spin class, and have laser focus before an
          important meeting? Are you overwhelmed from the flood of information
          from your social media and news feed? Any time your emotional state is
          out of balance, there are time-tested, practical methods to breathe
          your way back into the state of being you want.<br /><br />You have
          the capacity to change how you feel, in any moment, when you partner
          with your breath. It’s a matter of paying attention and then
          consciously altering your breathing pattern.<br /><br />Too often
          books on breathing and breathwork coaches do not teach the actual
          mechanics of breathing. Instead, they guide one-off sessions, teach
          protocols, or direct you to an app. The consequence of just following
          a protocol without understanding breathing mechanics leaves the
          student disempowered and dependent on the teacher. Instead, in
          <i>Breathe How You Want to Feel</i>, learning functional breathing
          becomes the basis upon which you gain control of your well-being—it’s
          the secret tool behind resiliency.<br /><br /><i
            >Breathe How You Want to Feel</i
          >
          offers you a psychophysical tool kit that includes:<br />· awareness
          building,<br />· understanding the dials of your nervous system,<br />·
          the importance of nasal breathing,<br />· how breath holds (even when
          very short) are a superpower, and<br />· how to integrate optimal
          breathing throughout your everyday life, especially when you're
          sleeping.<br /><br />You’ll use these tools to optimize your breathing
          to overcome being tired, wired, and uninspired. You’ll learn how to
          breathe optimally during your workday, while exercising, when entering
          meditative and flow states, and for deep rest. And you’ll partner with
          your breath to discover deeper meaning in life. This book meets you,
          the breather, where you are with step-by-step actionable tools to
          improve your health, sleep, and well-being.

          has convinced me that how we breathe is a portal to enhanced
