              >Renowned authority on science and philosophy Dr. Ervin Laszlo
              explores the implications of the new quantum sciences to move
              beyond the of limits of reality as we know it—and find our way
              again in our “in-formed,” purposively evolving universe.</b
            ><br /><br /><br /><i>Reconnecting to the Source </i>is a powerful
            new book on the science of spiritual experience by Dr. Ervin Laszlo.
            A well-known figure in the fields of new science, consciousness, and
            spirituality, Dr. Laszlo has inspired some of today’s most important
            figures in science and philosophy. In
            <i>Reconnecting to the Source</i> he unpacks the science behind
            spiritual experience, investigating the ways in which we can access
            realms of experience beyond the everyday. It is in these moments,
            when our conscious minds are in contact or perhaps even overridden
            by our unconscious selves, that we can explore the depths of
            spiritual meaning. <br /><br />
            In addition to a foreword by Deepak Chopra, the book includes new,
            never before published contributions from a long list of well-known
            writers and public figures—including Jane Goodall, Barbara Marx
            Hubbard, Zhi-Gang Sha and many more. Each contributor has written
            about a unique spiritual experience of their own, sharing moments in
            their lives that are outside of the boundaries of the usual and
            reflecting on the importance of these moments. <br /><br />
            This revolutionary and powerful book will challenge you to
            reconsider the boundaries of our own experience and change how we
            look at the world around us. It is a unique, never before available
            resource for people who want to know how they can consciously align
            with the forces and “attractors” that governs the universe, and
            brought us, living, conscious people on the scene in the great
            processes of evolution that unfold here on Earth.

          "The great value of this book is not just its impassioned call to
          improve everyday life, or its argument for seeing reality as it really
          is. Both aims are very important, but overriding them is a revolution
          in what it means to be human.<br /><br />On that basis, Laszlo has hit
          upon the ultimate salvation of everyone on the planet, in every
          generation for whom being human is the prime reason for our
          existence." —Deepak Chopra<br /><br /><br />"In <i>Reconnecting</i>
          <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>Source</i>, scientist, philosopher and
          futurist Ervin Laszlo catapults us light years beyond conventional
          thinking of self-help and recovery, to the very core of personal power
          and how to awaken it in our lives. Through true life accounts of
          intimate and personal journeys, Laszlo illustrates how the experiences
          that we sometimes discount, or are reluctant to share, are actually
          the clues that lead to our greatest power. I have no doubt that
          <i>Reconnecting to the Source </i>is destined to become a guide stone
          for the healing of the new millennium."—Gregg Braden<br /><br /><br />"Consolidating
          profound wisdom, quantum science and spirituality, Dr. Laszlo’s
          seminal book is a must read for anyone who wishes to become engaged in
          the consciousness evolution, individually and/or collectively.
          <i>Reconnecting with the Source</i> highlights abundant evidence for
          humanity’s need to reconnect with our wholeness, our oneness and
          ultimately the true source to everything: LOVE. This is without doubt
          the very best course of action if we are to generate a paradigm global
          shift in order to build a better world for us all, planet Earth and
          future generations. Indeed, LOVE is the medicine that will heal the
          world."<br />
