          One woman’s story of healing through Aboriginal principles and
          awakening to her own healing powers <br />
          <br />• Explains principles from the 60,000-year-old Aboriginal
          culture of Australia that can help create transformation in your life
          <br />
          <br />• Details her experiences participating in secret women’s
          ceremonies with an Outback Aboriginal tribe <br />
          <br />• Describes how she recovered from illness, met her team of
          spirit guides, coped with her husband’s passing, and found that love
          can transcend death <br />
          <br />Sharing her journey from bedridden patient to inspired healer,
          Robbie Holz recounts her recovery from hepatitis C, fibromyalgia, and
          treatment-induced brain damage, as well as the blossoming of her own
          healing powers, through her work with her husband, the late healer
          Gary Holz, and her experiences with a remote tribe in the Outback of
          Australia. <br />
          <br />Robbie describes many of the miraculous healings she witnessed
          while working with Gary in his Aboriginal-inspired healing practice.
          She details the powers that Gary developed after his transformative
          time being healed by Aborigines, including telepathy, seeing the inner
          workings of his patients’ bodies, and channeling the healing energy of
          the universe. She discloses how Gary accessed the Dreamtime, the
          energy field that is the source of reality, and reveals how her work
          with Gary led her to an invitation to participate in secret Aboriginal
          women’s ceremonies in the harsh Outback desert, where her own healing
          powers blossomed. <br />
          <br />Through her story of healing and discovery, Robbie describes
          principles from the 60,000-year-old Aboriginal culture that can help
          create transformation in your life. She explains how she became aware
          of her team of spirit guides, who provide unwavering support and
          unconditional love through each of life’s struggles. She shares the
          tenderness of her husband’s final moments and how she worked past her
          grief to transform her relationship with him, enabling him to become
          an active, loving part of her spirit team and partner in her healing
          work.
