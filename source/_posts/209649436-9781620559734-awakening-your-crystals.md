          A full-color guide to programming crystals and harnessing their full
          potential <br /><br />• Explains how to program crystals and gemstones
          with specific healing intentions as well as how to cleanse and charge
          your crystals and prepare your own energy field <br /><br />• Provides
          detailed instructions for working with 8 key crystals, as well as
          healing and programming guidance for more than 60 well-known and
          important crystals <br /><br />• Includes vibrant photographs to
          convey each crystal’s individual powers <br /><br />In this vibrantly
          illustrated crystal guide, experienced holistic therapist and
          crystal-healing teacher Sharon McAllister offers an introduction to
          programming crystals and gemstones to harness their full potential.
          She explains how crystal programming combines the powerful instrument
          of intention setting with the healing energies of stones. She details
          how to cleanse and charge your crystals and prepare your own energy
          field before programming and provides a collection of
          intention-setting statements and programming recipes for personal
          healing as well as therapeutic use. <br /><br />Unveiling the light
          that each crystal radiates vibrationally and spiritually, Sharon
          reveals how each crystal is a living being that can be awakened to
          emanate its purest and strongest energy in alignment with specific
          healing purposes. She explains the dormant state of stones when they
          are still inside the earth, their activated state when extracted by
          humans, and their ignited state, when they are called into direct
          service with a programmed focus, which leads them to unfold their full
          healing potential. <br /><br />Focusing on 8 key crystals, including
          rose quartz, amethyst, and citrine, Sharon shows how these 8 stones
          can combine to form a powerful toolkit with a wide range of healing
          applications. She provides an in-depth chapter on each of the 8 key
          crystals, offering deep insight into their energies and healing
          properties. She also covers more than 60 additional crystals along
          with guidance on their healing uses and programming potential.
          <br /><br />Taking your crystal healing experience to a higher level,
          this guide shows how each crystal has its own life plan just like
          human beings and when a crystal enters your life it is never by
          coincidence.
