          A simple practice to heal your past and cleanse negative memories to
          live a more peaceful and harmonious life <br /><br />• Details how to
          apply Ho'oponopono to deal with traumatic past events, destructive
          thought patterns, family dynamics, daily annoyances, or any other
          disagreeable event in your life, from traffic jams to relationship
          break-ups <br /><br />• Draws on the new science of epigenetics and
          quantum physics to explain how Ho'oponopono works <br /><br />•
          Explains how the trauma of past events can cloud your perceptions and
          reveals how to break free from the weight of your memories
          <br /><br />Based on an ancestral Hawaiian shamanic ritual, the
          healing practice of Ho'oponopono teaches you to cleanse your
          consciousness of negative memories, unconscious fears, and
          dysfunctional programming and grant yourself forgiveness, peace, and
          love. The process is deceptively simple--first you must recognize your
          own responsibility for creating the events in your life, then you are
          ready to apply the mantra of Ho'oponopono: I’m sorry, Forgive me,
          Thank you, I love you. Repeated several times over a dedicated
          interval, the negativity is replaced with inner peace, love, and
          harmony--and, as the stories in this book show, sometimes even
          miracles take place. <br /><br />In this step-by-step guide, the
          authors explain how to apply Ho'oponopono to traumatic past events,
          destructive thought patterns, family dynamics, daily annoyances, or
          any other disagreeable event in your life, from traffic jams to
          relationship break-ups. Drawing on quantum physics and epigenetics,
          they explore how Ho'oponopono works--how thoughts and consciousness
          can affect the expression of your DNA, the materialization of your
          goals, and the behavior of those around you. They explain how negative
          thought patterns and memories unconsciously guide your life and draw
          more negativity to you, perpetuating the cycle of bad events and
          clouding your recollection of the past. By apologizing to yourself,
          your memory, and the event in question, you can forgive yourself, heal
          your memories, and cleanse your perceptions. By reconciling with
          yourself, you open your heart to love for your experiences, yourself,
          and others and bring harmony to your mind, body, and the world around
          you.

          “Nine little words that can make miracles! That’s what this book is
          about. It’s an ancient Hawaiian shamanic ritual that was adapted to
          suit contemporary life forty years ago and has been gaining popularity
          ever since. With steady application, order is restored to both the
          inner and outer environments and fears and negative memories are
          transmuted into love.” “The simplicity of this life skill is
          deceptive. The authors have gone to great lengths to clearly explain
          the science, spiritual philosophy, and shamanic (esoteric) practice
          which explains how and why it works. There are inspiring stories to
          illustrate the healing that can occur. From traumatic events to every
          day annoyances, the authors demonstrate how using the technique
          releases negative thought forms, past and present, in order to make
          room for harmony and love. With consistent use, the intellect gives
          way to the intuition of the heart, healing and cleansing the stored
          information in the subconscious and allowing a reconciliation with our
          inner selves. Let your customers know that it is easy to understand
          and apply, and that the technique has a solid track record of
          success.”
