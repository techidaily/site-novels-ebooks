          • Explores the schools of Solomonic magic around the world and works
          such as <i>The Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon the King</i> and
          <i>The Hygromancy of Solomon</i> <br /><br />• Examines Solomon’s
          magical possessions, including his famous ring that gave him command
          over animals, weather, demons, genies, and djinns, as well as his
          amulets, remedies, exorcisms, and charms <br /><br />• Looks at the
          extensive presence of Solomon in folklore around the world, including
          in Armenia, Malaysia, Russia, Bulgaria, Morocco, India, and Egypt
          <br /><br />Looking at the Solomonic magical tradition and Solomon’s
          profound influence on esoteric traditions around the world, Claude
          Lecouteux reveals King Solomon not only as one of the great kings of
          prehistory but also as the ancient world’s foremost magician and
          magus. Examining the primary sources on Solomon, such as the Bible,
          the Koran, and the writings of Flavius Josephus, the author explores
          Solomon’s judgments, his explorations, his literary and scientific
          works (including an herbal), and his constructions beyond the
          eponymous temple, such as the copper city in Andalus built by the
          djinns and the baths of Sulayman. He also looks at Solomon’s magical
          possessions, such as his famous ring and the Philosopher’s Stone. The
          author examines the supernatural powers granted to Solomon by his
          ring, which he received from the angel Gabriel, including command over
          animals, weather, and demons, and explores in detail Solomon’s power
          over genies and djinns.<br /><br />Following the esoteric threads
          hidden within the primary sources on Solomon, Lecouteux reveals the
          work of Solomon the Magician, exploring his amulets, remedies,
          exorcisms, charms, and his influence on Arab and Western magic.
          Providing illustrations of sigils, talismans, and other magic symbols
          related to Solomon, the author examines the schools of Solomonic
          Folkloremagic and works such as
          <i>The Greater and Lesser Keys of Solomon the King</i> and
          <i>The Hygromancy of Solomon</i>. He then looks at the extensive
          presence of Solomon in folklore worldwide, including in Armenia,
          Israel, Malaysia, Eastern Europe, Russia, Morocco, India, Mongolia,
          and among the Abyssinians of Ethiopia and the Copts in Egypt. He also
          looks at Solomon’s role within the Bulgarian tradition from which the
          Cathars derived. <br /><br />Painting an in-depth portrait of Solomon
          the Magician-King, Lecouteux reveals how this legendary magus left a
          deep impression upon the occult, magical traditions, and philosophies
          of the ancient world that can still be felt to this day.

          “In this splendid compendium, Claude Lecouteux brings together
          stories, folktales, lore, and legends associated with the Biblical
          King Solomon. King of ancient Israel, he founded castles and cities as
          well as a palace of glass and his most famous Temple in Jerusalem.
          Solomon’s legacy spread across the Middle East into Europe, Africa,
          and beyond. Reputed author of one thousand and five books of poems,
          psalms, and songs and three thousand parables, he also interacted with
          animals, whose languages he understood. Solomon was one of the great
          historical practitioners of magic. Solomon’s seal and ring gave him
          power over various kinds of spirits. All his possessions--his net, his
          throne, and his chalice among them--were infused with magical power.
          Claude Lecouteux’s masterly reconstruction of the wondrous world of
          King Solomon from ancient documents is by far the most comprehensive
          survey yet published of the many different aspects of this ancient and
          influential monarch.”
