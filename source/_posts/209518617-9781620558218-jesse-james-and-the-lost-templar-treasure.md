          An investigation into the lost treasures of Jesse James and the
          Freemasons and their connections to the Templars, Rosicrucians, and
          the Founding Fathers <br /><br />• Explains how Jesse James used
          techniques involving sacred geometry, gematria, and esoteric symbols
          to hide his treasures and encode maps <br /><br />• Provides
          instructions for using the encoding template employed by Jesse James
          and the Freemasons to hide and recover treasure and sacred relics
          <br /><br />• Shows how the encoding template confirms the existence
          of treasures on Oak Island and Victorio Peak and can be traced to a
          16th-century book containing a secret map of the New World and the
          “hooked X” of the Knights Templar <br /><br />Jesse James left behind
          secret diaries and coded treasure maps. Working to decrypt these maps,
          Daniel J. Duke--the great-great-grandson of Jesse James--reveals
          hidden treasures yet to be recovered as well as connections between
          the infamous train robber and Freemasonry, the Knights Templar, the
          Founding Fathers, and Jewish mysticism. <br /><br />The author
          explains how Jesse James faked his death and lived out his final years
          under the name James L. Courtney. He uncovers James’ affiliation with
          the Knights of the Golden Circle, a secret society that buried
          Confederate gold across the United States, and shows how the hidden
          treasures coded into James’ maps were not affiliated with the KGC but
          with the Freemasons, the Knights Templar, and the treasure of the
          Temple Mount. Using sacred geometry, gematria, and the Kabbalistic
          Tree of Life symbol, the author explains the encoded map technique
          used by the Freemasons to hide and later recover treasures, an
          esoteric template known as the “Veil”. He shows how the Veil template
          confirms the locations of Jesse James’ recovered treasures in Texas as
          well as other suspected treasure locations, such as the Oak Island
          Money Pit and Victorio Peak in New Mexico. <br /><br />Tracing
          knowledge of the Veil template back through the centuries, the author
          reveals the Veil hidden on the cover of a 16th-century book that
          contains a secret map of the New World and the “hooked X” symbol of
          the Knights Templar. He shows how the template was used not only to
          hide treasures but also sacred knowledge and relics, such as within
          the Bruton Vault, which originally contained secrets tied to Francis
          Bacon, the Freemasons, the Rosicrucians, and the founding of the
          United States. Applying the Veil template alongside the esoteric
          secrets of Poussin’s famous painting, <i>Et In Arcadia Ego</i>, and
          Cassini’s Celestial Globe, Duke shows how the template reveals other
          Templar and Freemason treasure sites scattered throughout America and
          around the world.

          “Daniel J. Duke has successfully cracked open part of the mystery
          surrounding Templar treasure from Jerusalem that had been moved to the
          Americas to help establish a free nation.
          <i>Jesse James and the Lost Templar Treasure</i> goes beyond just
          theorizing that treasure was moved to the Americas and in fact
          demonstrates the connections and methods utilized to hide certain
          treasures. There have always been those who have sought to shape
          history to ensure that freedoms and artifacts could be preserved in
          the Americas. Daniel J. Duke’s book is on the cutting edge of
          revealing some of what has remained hidden. Anybody who is interested
          in the Templar legacy and their connection with the Americas will find
          true gems in this book!”
