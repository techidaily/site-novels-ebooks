          A professor of religious studies meticulously documents his insights
          from 73 high-dose LSD sessions conducted over the course of 20 years
          <br /><br />• Chronicles, with unprecedented rigor, the author’s
          systematic journey into a unified field of consciousness that
          underlies all physical existence <br /><br />• Makes a powerful case
          for the value of psychedelically induced spiritual experience and
          discusses the challenge of integrating these experiences into everyday
          life <br /><br />• Shows how psychedelic experience can take you
          beyond self-transformation into collective transformation and help
          birth the future of humanity <br /><br />On November 24, 1979,
          Christopher M. Bache took the first step on what would become a
          life-changing journey. Drawing from his training as a philosopher of
          religion, Bache set out to explore his mind and the mind of the
          universe as deeply and systematically as possible--with the help of
          the psychedelic drug LSD. Following protocols established by Stanislav
          Grof, Bache’s 73 high-dose LSD sessions over the course of 20 years
          drew him into a deepening communion with cosmic consciousness.
          <br /><br />Journey alongside professor Bache as he touches the living
          intelligence of our universe--an intelligence that both embraced and
          crushed him--and demonstrates how direct experience of the divine can
          change your perspective on core issues in philosophy and religion.
          Chronicling his 73 sessions, the author reveals the spiral of death
          and rebirth that took him through the collective unconscious into the
          creative intelligence of the universe. Making a powerful case for the
          value of psychedelically induced spiritual experience, Bache shares
          his immersion in the fierce love and creative intent of the unified
          field of consciousness that underlies all physical existence. He
          describes the incalculable value of embracing the pain and suffering
          he encountered in his sessions and the challenges he faced integrating
          his experiences into his everyday life. His journey documents a shift
          from individual consciousness to collective consciousness, from
          archetypal reality to Divine Oneness and the Diamond Luminosity that
          lies outside cyclic existence. <br /><br />Pushing the boundaries of
          theory and practice, the author shows how psychedelic experience can
          take you beyond self-transformation into collective transformation,
          beyond the present into the future, revealing spirit and matter in
          perfect balance.
