            powerful trinity of Black authors invites us into the living room of
            their hearts, affirming who we are with earthy straight talk,
            textured diversity, and wise tenderness."—Ruth King<br /><br />Real
            talk on living joyfully and coming home to ourselves—with reflective
            self-care practices to help us on our interconnected journeys of
            liberation</b
          ><br /><br />Join three friends, three Black women, all teachers in
          the Plum Village tradition founded by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, in
          intimate conversation, touching on the pain and beauty of their
          families of origin, relationships and loneliness, intimacy and
          sexuality, politics, popular culture, race, self-care and healing. No
          subject is out of bounds in this free-flowing, wide-ranging offering
          of mindful wisdom to nourish our sense of belonging and connection
          with ancestors.<br /><br />Authors Valerie Brown, Marisela Gomez, MD,
          and Kaira Jewel Lingo share how the Dharma's timeless teachings
          support their work for social and racial equity and justice in their
          work and personal lives. The book offers insights in embodied
          mindfulness practice to support us in healing white supremacy,
          internalized racial oppression, and social and cultural conditioning,
          leading to a firm sense of belonging and abiding joy.

          "Generous and restorative, this powerful trinity of Black authors
          invites us into the living room of their hearts, affirming who we are
          with earthy straight talk, textured diversity, and wise
          tenderness.&nbsp;<i>Healing Our Way Home</i>&nbsp;takes us back and
          moves us forward in joy, unity, and reverence. Read if you want both
          comfort and truth."<br />&nbsp;—Ruth&nbsp;King, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out</i
          ><br /><br />"As a White-bodied person, I am enlarged by&nbsp;<i
            >Healing Our Way Home</i
          >—reading it has brought smiles and tears, understanding and
          inspiration. These wise teachings guide us to reconnect with our
          spiritual roots and bring a courageous presence into our contemporary
          world. The book itself is an activity of love, like an intimate warm
          conversation at the kitchen table."<br />—Tara&nbsp;Brach, author
          of&nbsp;<i>Radical Acceptance</i><br /><br />"This beautiful offering
          is a direct and courageous response to the ancestors’ call to heal the
          generations before and those who will come after. Having created a
          sacred circle, to teach and allow us to listen in, pays honor to the
          indigenous ways teachers taught in ancient times. All we need to do is
          listen clearly with our hearts. What is being shared here goes beyond
          the stories and follows a winding path towards joy and liberation."<br />—Zenju
          Earthlyn Manuel, author of&nbsp;<i>The Shamanic Bones of Zen</i
          >,&nbsp;<i>The Way of Tenderness</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Deepest Peace</i
          ><br /><br />"In a world that too often leads with the mind,&nbsp;<i
            >Healing Our Way Home</i
          >&nbsp;is a true gift from the heart. It transmits the ancient wisdom
          of the dharma through story and narrative, painting a beautiful
          picture of what wisdom looks and feels like. I found myself constantly
          smiling as I moved through these pages. The paths that the three
          authors took in their lives is a gift to the dharma as much as the
          dharma has been a gift to them."<br />—Kazu&nbsp;Haga, author
