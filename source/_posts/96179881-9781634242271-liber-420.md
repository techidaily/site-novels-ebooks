          Although little known, cannabis and other psychoactive plants held a
          prominent and important role in the Occult arts of Alchemy and Magic,
          as well as being used in ritual initiations of certain secret
          societies. Find out about the important role cannabis played in
          helping to develop modern medicines through alchemical works. Cannabis
          played a pivotal role in spagyric alchemy, and appears in the works of
          alchemists such as Zosimos, Avicenna, Llull, Paracelsus, Cardano and
          Rabelais. Cannabis also played a pivotal role in medieval and
          renaissance magic and recipes with instructions for its use appear in
          a number of influential and important grimoires such as the Picatrix,
          Sepher Raxiel: Liber Salomonis, and The Book of Oberon. Could cannabis
          be the Holy Grail? With detailed historical references, the author
          explores the allegations the Templars were influenced by the hashish
          ingesting Assassins of medieval Islam, and that myths of the Grail are
          derived from the Persian traditions around the sacred beverage known
          as haoma, which was a preparation of cannabis,opium and other drugs.
          Many of the works discussed, have never been translated into English,
          or published in centuries. The unparalleled research in this volume
          makes it a potential perennial classic on the subjects of both
          medieval and renaissance history of cannabis, as well as the role of
          plants in the magical and occult traditions.

          "Bennett has done it again. Going right to the primary sources, he has
          produced an extraordinary volume outlining the history and occult
          secrets of cannabis. ... Should you be interested in knowing how and
          why cannabis found employment in the occult arts throughout history,
          take heart in knowing that you hold in your hands the definitive work
          written by a brilliant historian." â€”Tom Hatsis, author of
