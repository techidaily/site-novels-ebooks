              Meditation Wanderlust Hollywood, and Lululemon ambassador Megan

              soul-searchers.</b

          ><br /><br />This modern guide to meditation from instructor Megan
          Monahan takes readers beyond empty Instagram truisms to the simple yet
          effective ways to "meditate their way through the bad shit and into
          the good shit." With a fresh voice and perspective, Monahan presents a
          set of tools grounded in a meditation technique that is impossible to
          screw up. With her help, you'll unpack the five spiritual mindsets
          (<b>P</b>resence, <b>A</b>cceptance, <b>I</b>ntention,
          <b>N</b>onjudgment, and <b>T</b>rust, aka PAINT) that are key to
          moving out of constriction and fear and into a more expansive space
          within yourself and your life. Ultimately, you will quickly notice, at
          any triggering moment, where you're getting stuck and how to more
          consciously move through it. The good news? This process is applicable
          to everything in your life, from missing a flight to seeing your ex's
          engagement photo on social media to losing your job. Wouldn't it be
          nice to not be completely leveled by any of those occurrences? Plot
          twist: After reading this book, taking the quizzes, and doing the
          themed meditations . . . you won't be!
