            >Hoodoo spellwork and rituals for self-protection and how to get

            Features 129 spells, 32 recipes, and numerous rituals.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Historically, Hoodoo was the magic of the disenfranchised,
          marginalized, and vulnerable. It was born of the need to obtain
          justice, power, and protection, as these were not typically naturally
          forthcoming. The ancestors and earliest practitioners of Hoodoo were
          enslaved African Americans, followed by their descendants and
          neighbors.<br /><br />
          How does one obtain justice if the system is inherently skewed against
          you? Hoodoo has developed a vast arsenal of justice and payback
          spells—spells intended to create a balance of power, punish
          victimizers, and protect victims from further victimization. It also
          empowers the victimized, so that they are able to rise above their
          situations, restore self-esteem, and create better, happier lives for
          themselves. The spells vary from mild to aggressive, depending on the
          personal level of justification.<br /><br /><b
            ><i>Hoodoo Justice Magic</i></b
          >
          contains a diverse collection of these spells, as well as an
          exploration of their ethics. (Are you really justified? And what
          happens if you’re not?) Featuring 129 spells, 32 recipes, and numerous
          rituals, there are also 27 prayers for people who fear actually
          performing spellwork. The spells incorporate common household
          articles, such as salt and spices, as well as candles, tarot cards,
          and recitation of Psalms. Learn how to protect yourself and avoid
          trouble by recognizing the signs indicating predatory behavior.
          (Although several spells incorporate specific tarot cards, no previous
          knowledge or experience of them is required, as they are used as
          materials or objects that radiate magic power.)

          “Sometimes we feel powerless to prevent injustice and are told never
          to take justice into our own hands, but that doesn’t apply to all
          situations. There are times when we need to use Magical Justice to
          regain our power, protect ourselves or our loved ones, and settle the
          score. In her infinite wisdom, Miss Aida has conjured up the ideal
          spell book to do just that. &nbsp;Whether it’s a hex, a curse, or just
          needing to get the upper hand on a pesky situation,
          <i>Hoodoo Justice Magic</i> is a treasure trove of spells that will
          enable the reader to right the wrongs in a hands-on and
          straightforward way.”
