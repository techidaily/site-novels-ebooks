          “<i>You Are the Medicine</i> is a profound and beautifully written
          book offered by Indigenous Medicine Woman Asha Frost. With a sensitive
          lyricism and nuance in her writing she shares stories inspired by her
          Ojibway ancestry following the lunar calendar of 13 moons. This book
          reveals how to claim our inherent capacity for healing in all ways.
          Inviting us to connect to our own ancestral wisdom by sharing hers,
          she generously and lovingly shows us the way home. A must read for our
          times.” —<b>Colette Baron-Reid</b>, Author and Oracle Creator<br /><br />“I
          have deep respect for Asha Frost and the sacred work she does. In
          <i>You Are the Medicine</i>, Asha takes us on a journey sharing deep
          wisdom through mesmerising storytelling and embodied wisdom. Through
          rituals and sacred journeys she then lovingly guides us to recover the
          power and beauty of ourown ancestral lineages. This beautiful book
          will breathe life into your soul and reconnect you to the medicine
          that has always been whispering within.” — <b>Rebecca Campbell</b>,
          Best-selling Author, Mystic, and Mother<br /><br />“There is an
          unmistakable magic about Asha Frost—she is soft yet strong, fierce yet
          loving. This book is not only an honouring of sacred ancestry it, also
          shares a tender yet deep respect for the Earth and her medicine while
          guiding us to authentically own who we are in a way that is in
          alignment with our roots. This work will initiate great healing and
          inspire essential change in your life.” — <b>Kyle Gray</b>,
          Best-selling Author of <i>Raise Your Vibration</i> and
          <i>Angel Prayers<br /><br /></i>“Asha is a brilliant force of love and
          healing, and her ability to help others connect to their own innate
          medicine feels like a gift from Spirit.” — <b>Chris-Anne Donnelly</b>,
          Creator of <i>The Sacred Creator’s Oracle</i> and
          <i>The Light Seer’s Tarot</i><br /><br />“This book contains the cure
          to what ails us in these times: disconnection and having forgotten who
          we are. Allow yourself to be taken on this transformative journey to
          remembering who you are, what you came here for, and how to access
          your power anytime, anywhere, anyplace.” — <b>Kate Northrup</b>,
          Best-selling Author of <i>Do Less<br /><br /></i>“<i
            >You Are the Medicine</i
          >
          is an act of great, and maybe undeserved, generosity. If you are
          interested in including activism and decolonization work as a part of
          your spiritual practice, Asha Frost leads you into the potency of her
          Indigenous culture while also guiding and imploring you to reckon with
          the implications of the borrowing.” — <b>Kimberly Ann Johnson</b>,
          Somatic Experiencing Practitioner, Sexological Bodyworker, Birth
          Doula, and Author of <i>Call of The Wild</i><br /><br />“No matter who
          you are, you need this book. We are all searching for healing, to
          remember that we are indeed our own best medicine. Asha is the perfect
          guide to take our hand and lead us back home to ourselves, to help us
          ask brave questions and step forward with courage. I hope you’ll buy
          this book and begin the journey of becoming who you were sacredly
          created to be. I’ll be returning to Asha’s teaching again and again.”
          — <b>Kaitlin Curtice</b>, Author of <i>Native<br /><br /></i>“This
          book is a gift to the world. It carries the voice and vision of the
          Ancestors. It is a portal that offers an invitation for each reader to
          reclaim the Medicine within. Do yourself a favor and pick up this
          treasure today! So grateful You Are the Medicine exists!” —
          <b>Christine Gutierrez</b>, Licensed Psychotherapist, Speaker, Author
          of <i>I am Diosa<br /><br /></i>“Asha Frost is a thought-leader
          anchored in her Indigenous spiritual tradition for our times. Her book
          and her work is a shining light forus to follow as we navigate a loss
          of meaning and a heartbreaking, confusing world. She guides us back to
          purpose with so much clarity as she invites us into reflection,
          ritual, story and journeying. Thank you Asha for this gift. We listen
          and receive.” — <b>Susanna Barkataki</b>, Speaker, Yoga Culture
          Advocate, Author of <i>Embrace Yoga’s Roots</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          Asha Frost (she/her) is an Indigenous Medicine Woman and a member of
          the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation. She is from the Crane Clan, the
          totem of leadership, and believes in holding space from vision and
          heart. As an energy healer, homeopath, and mentor, Asha has guided
          thousands of people through profound and lasting transformation.<br /><br />Impacted
          by generational trauma and colonization, Asha has been on a lifelong
          journey of reclamation. A lupus diagnosis sent her on a path of
          studying and practicing a multitude of energy Medicine modalities with
          many guides. She has blended this life experience with her innate
          gifts and the wisdom of her Ancestors. She loves sharing her Medicine
          in powerful ways through Ceremonies, teachings, and speaking events.
          Through this work, she loves seeing people reclaim their roots, find
          their healing wisdom, and rise into their power.<br /><br />Asha lives
          on Anishinaabe, Huron-Wendat, and Haudenosaunee Territory, with her
          husband and two beautiful children, with whom she co-creates a better
          world for the seven generations to come.
