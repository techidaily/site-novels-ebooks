            >A guide to invocations, rituals, and histories at the intersection
            of magic and feminism, as informed by history's witches--and the
            sociopolitical culture that gave rise to them.</b
          ><br /><br />When you start looking for witches, you find them
          everywhere. As seekers and practitioners reclaim and restore magic to
          its rightful place among powerful forces for social, personal, and
          political transformation, more people than ever are claiming the
          identity of "Witch." But our knowledge of witchcraft and magic has
          been marred by erasure, sensationalism, and sterilization, the true
          stories of history's witches left untold.<br /><br />Through
          meditations, stories, and practices, authors Risa Dickens and Amy
          Torok offer an intersectional, contemporary lens for uncovering and
          reconnecting with feminist witch history. Sharing traditions from all
          over the world--from Harlem to Haiti, Oaxaca to Mesopotamia--<i
            >Missing Witches</i
          >
          introduces readers to figures like Monica Sjoo, HP Blavatsky, Maria
          Sabina, and Enheduanna, shedding light on their work and the cultural
          and sociopolitical contexts that shaped it. Structured around the 8
          sabbats of the Wheel of the Year, each chapter
          includes&nbsp;illustrations by Amy Torok, as well as invocations,
          rituals, and offerings that incorporate the authors' own wisdom,
          histories, and journeys of trauma, loss, and empowerment.
          <i>Missing Witches</i> offers an inside look at the vital stories of
          women who have practiced--and lived--magic.

          “Here … we meet the Witch friends we always wanted and find the coven
          we always wish we had.”<br />—Amanda Yates Garcia, author of
          <i>Initiated<br /><br /></i>“Amy and Risa are the Witches I was
          missing! Join them and discover powerfully creative yet complicated
          Witches, whose storied tales were almost lost to time.”<br />—Jinkx
          Monsoon, drag artist and winner of <i>RuPaul’s Drag Race</i
          ><br /><br />“I have been wishing for a book such as this for ages,
          and I’m so grateful that Risa Dickens and Amy Torok are the ones to
          have conjured it. Through their signature brew of scholarship,
          sensitivity, and bright spirit, these bewitching writers have crafted
          a tome that honors many brave and brilliant feminine magic-makers. I’m
          in awe of the trailblazing Witches who are in
          <i>Missing Witches</i>—as I am of the ones who wrote it.”<br />—Pam
