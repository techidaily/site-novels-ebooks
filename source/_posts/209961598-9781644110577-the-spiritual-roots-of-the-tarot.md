          Learn the path to enlightenment and inner peace encoded by the Cathar
          in the Major Arcana of the Marseille Tarot <br /><br />• Reveals how
          the secret wisdom teachings of the heretical Cathar sect were hidden
          in plain sight in the imagery of the Major Arcana of the Marseille
          Tarot deck <br /><br />• Decodes each of the cards in detail and shows
          how they offer clear instructions for recalibrating human
          consciousness and achieving enlightenment <br /><br />• Shares the
          author’s self-development program, based on the wisdom of the cards,
          for creating a lifestyle filled with peace, joy, good health, and
          meaning <br /><br />The Holy Grail has been discovered. Not a cup or
          chalice as myth leads us to believe, the Holy Grail is sacred
          knowledge of the path to enlightenment and inner peace. While author
          Russell Sturgess was conducting research on the Marseille Tarot, he
          found evidence that this tarot deck, while masquerading as a simple
          card game, held the teachings of an ancient heretical religious group
          from southern France, the Cathar, believed to be the keepers of the
          Holy Grail. To avoid persecution by the papacy, this sect used
          portable art like illuminations to convey their Gnostic Christian
          teachings, in the same way the stained glass windows of churches spoke
          to their congregations. This portable Cathar art then inspired the
          creation of the Tarot. <br /><br />After his breakthrough discovery of
          a hidden key on the Magician and Strength cards, Sturgess examined the
          Major Arcana cards further and used the key to unlock their symbolism,
          discovering clear instructions for recalibrating human consciousness
          and achieving enlightenment, with specific cards representing pivotal
          points in making the journey from ignorance to awareness. Decoding the
          cards in detail, the author shows how they reveal a journey of
          transformed consciousness that can result in finding what the Cathar
          called “the kingdom of heaven.” <br /><br />Calling this sacred
          knowledge “the Cathar Code,” Sturgess reveals his personal development
          program based on the Code that opens access to a meaningful lifestyle
          filled with peace and joy and that naturally fosters health and
          well-being. He shows how these teachings offer a clear path that
          transforms a life burdened by fear of failure, rejection, and scarcity
          into one with clarity of purpose, self-honoring, kindness, and the
          abundance that comes with making a fulfilling difference in the world.

          “The book takes the reader on a spiritual pilgrimage of evolving
          consciousness, where, as ‘fools,’ we are initially absorbed by and
          enmeshed in the worldly attractions of wealth, power, love and fame,
          but the process of life represented by justice, time and chance brings
          us to a crossroads and entry into the dark night of the soul and
          various stages of growth- represented by individual cards-culminating
          in unlocking the gate of heaven.”
