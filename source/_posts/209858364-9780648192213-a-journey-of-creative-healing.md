            “In a time so in need of true elders to guide the coming
            generations, Mary is a shining example of someone who walks her
            talk, whose purpose in life is to serve and encourage others to be
            true to themselves.”<br /><strong

            I need to put my focus on being creative. I need to create something
            new each day. It doesn’t matter what—I simply need to focus on the
            planning and joy of creativity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />Mary Atkins was a young mother of two small children when her
            husband was tragically killed in a light aircraft accident. Her
            body, already exhibiting signs that something was amiss, bore the
            brunt of this tragedy and at the age of 27 she was diagnosed with
            multiple sclerosis. Doctors told her she would be wheelchair-bound
            within months.
          </p>
          <p><br />But that’s not what happened.</p>
          <p>
            <br />Instead, Mary recovered. Her journey to wellness began when
            she acted on a powerful intuitive voice that suggested she undertake
            a strict daily program of creative expression—to plan, create or do
            something she had never done before.&nbsp; Within twelve months she
            could once again walk without aids. She has now been in full
            remission from MS for more than fifty years.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />In A Journey of Creative Healing Mary shares her remarkable
            story—and those of other survivors who have endured equally
            debilitating emotional and physical shocks—and reveals how listening
            to your intuitive voice, exploring creativity in all its guises, can
            deliver recovery from overwhelming grief and profound illness. By
            following her six steps to healing Mary believes you too can find
            your way home to health.
