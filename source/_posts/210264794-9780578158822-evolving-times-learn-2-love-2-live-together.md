            Learn2Love2Live Together&nbsp;is a dive into the human experience in
            today's modern world. We will search and explore the inner
            complexities of contemporary man's relationships with himself, with
            the end goal of learning from them and improving on them.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Learn2Love2Live Together&nbsp;is the first book of its kind that
            challenges the reader to face current issues in evolving times,
            provoking them to ponder pertinent questions. For instance, how do
            we peacefully co-exist together? What actions are we prepared to
            commit to this present day to begin to physically manifest a
            tranquil existence amongst all the inhabitants of our home planet
            earth? The details are in the thoughts, functions, more importantly,
            operations of collective humanity to ultimately propel us forward as
            a functioning prospering species. This work aims to pose questions
            so that we can begin to see the big picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;That indeed,
            we are a collective body with ultimately the same aspirations and
            goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;The liberty to exercise free thought and move
            freely towards the pursuit of happiness in the form of exceptional
            quality of life. It further engages the reader - as this reality is
            of your making - by letting your voice be heard and expressed!&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            How does this book differ, you may ask? It sounds like any other
            book. As psychology students, we are taught how to conduct
            experiments to capture valuable feedback to use in studies,
            providing additional data regarding our species. I ask for your
            participation by providing your input in real-time by going to
            https://learn2love2live.com/global-think-tank. Doing this will
            empower you to provide your solutions to posed questions that affect
            our current reality.

          <p>
            As we embark upon the new millennium before us, we can all agree
            that humanity requires a tune-up in its thought and ideas on how we
            think and function as a species.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Learn2Love2Live Together&nbsp;presents a fresh perspective on
            enjoying, experiencing, and living this life as intended.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This reading will also reflect humanity's current reality, exposing
            both the grim and lighter aspects it holds. Ultimately, its end goal
            is to unveil some truths and valuable insights to spur thought and
            initiate action. It is a tool to encourage humanity to welcome its
            much-needed transformation by acting as a spark, igniting the
            process.&nbsp;

          <p>
            Throughout man's existence, he has experienced seasons - natural
            cycles, if you will - animatedly expressed in the continual rise and
            decline of human civilizations.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)"
              >&nbsp;</span
            >We live in an ordered world where some processes and systems are
            attributed to the foundation of the root harmony we experience as
            life. These never-ending naturally observed cycles and systems are
            further studied and classified into sciences for human consumption
            and understanding.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0)">&nbsp;</span
            >These rhythmic oscillations act as signatures of humanity's ongoing
            efforts to rise above the fray.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            And yet, still after ages of studying, here we find ourselves again
            at a crossroads. The question remains: do we join our progenitors as
            a lost, forgotten civilization consumed by our ignorance and pride?
            Or do we dare seek a new path unexplored, casting off our appetite
            for war and destruction in exchange for the mantle of peace and
            harmony, choosing to harmonize with the greater conscious
            reality?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            We must utilize all of the advancements we possess in technology,
            agriculture, economics, and most important of all,
            relationships.&nbsp;&nbsp;To do so would progress us forward
            immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now is the time for us to unify and
            advantageously utilize our diversity, securing our future as a
            unified entity.&nbsp;
