          <p>
            <br />One of Australia’s thought leaders in Western Mindfulness,
            Russell Sturgess, shares intimate details of his own journey to
            illustrate his groundbreaking approach for helping people discover
            the self-worth, needed to manifest a better quality of life. As with
            most people, Russell had become imprisoned by his fears. The walls
            of Russell’s prison were made from bricks of depression, obesity,
            divorce and bankruptcy. All cemented together with a mortar of fear
            and self-doubt.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2006, Russell had the rare opportunity to unlock mysteries never
            before revealed from a set of 22 medieval images that he calls The
            Cathar Code. What he discovered was a process that had the capacity
            to free people from their prison of fear and doubt. Going on to
            formulate the code into a program of personal growth, Russell found
            that people who fully participated in the program were naturally
            choosing to be more self-loving, since they had become more aware of
            their true worth.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides creating a better quality of life, these people naturally
            became compassionate and kind toward others. This was expressed
            through social justice, forgiveness, unconditional love, while being
            committed to peace.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In Get Out of Jail Card, Russell explains how the bricks of his
            prison were dismantled, which saw his weight becoming healthy (he
            lost 50kg), his relationships being consistently joyful, his bouts
            of depression being replaced with clarity of purpose, as well as
            making significant strides in rectifying his finances. When
            self-worth and compassion, replaced fear and self-doubt, the mortar
            that held together the walls of the prison dissolved, making the
            dismantling a reality.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The keystone to Russell being freed from his imprisonment, was the
            understanding he developed of what he called ‘his story’. The
            ‘story’ is a personally held belief of poor self-worth, that moulds
            the bricks that form your prison wall. Given its capacity to hold
            anyone imprisoned for the whole of their life, Russell playfully
            referred to the story as a life-sentence. In his book, Russell gives
            you a tool for identifying your life-sentence. It is literally a
            sentence that describes the unique form that your poor self-worth
            takes.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            What Russell came to understand was that anytime he was out of
            stillness, anytime his inner-peace was disturbed, he was running his
            story. This meant that he was responsible for his own happiness,
            peace, and joy. They weren’t consequences, they were choices. And in
            order to choose them, he had to be free of his story.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            In medieval times, when someone sinned seriously enough that they
            had to pay penance, they would often be sent on a pilgrimage. In
            2011, Russell went on a self-imposed pilgrimage. The result saw
            Russell being granted parole (partial freedom) from his
            imprisonment. A significant part of Get Out of Jail Card includes
            Russell’s personal experiences while walking the Camino de Santiago
            in Spain, including the aftermath. Even though he had been paroled,
            he hadn’t been pardoned.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            While walking the Camino, Russell still wasn’t aware of his story.
            It wasn’t until almost two years after completing the Camino that he
            finally ‘got’ his story. Only when he understood his story was it
            possible for him to be pardoned. Being aware of his story meant that
            Russell could see his true worth, this meant he could make
            self-loving choices. Russell finishes his book by describing how the
            quality of his life improved once he was no longer held prisoner by
            his ‘story’.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            You know you are free of your life-sentence when you can feel
            gratitude for it. This happens when you can see the gift in your
            story and use that gift to bless the lives of others.
