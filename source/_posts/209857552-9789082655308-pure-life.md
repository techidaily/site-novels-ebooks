            There are two wolves inside of you<br />The wolf of personality and
            the wolf of Infinite love<br />Which one will win?<br />The one you
            feed
          </p>
          <p>
            More and more people dare to trust the power of love in all aspects
            of life, without judgement or expectations. They share one dream: to
            be restored back to their original state of being,&nbsp;freed from
            all illusions and lack of freedom. They are the movers and shakers
            who are creating a new society where love becomes the legal tender.
            They are heart people who seek win-win in heart economics. They
            include superconscious business people, scientists, journalists,
            doctors, teachers, lawyers, politicians, bankers and many others.
            They are people forging organizations with the fire of Love,
            inspired by the Force of Life moving them toward a next step in
            human consciousness.

            Efmorfidis, CEO/Founder of COCO-MAT<br /><br />‘Ivo Valkenburg
            (Netherlands, 1966) brings the world an important antidote to a
            global pandemic of debt money enslavement and trauma. Thank goodness
            that he did not despair over his financial problems and leave this
            earth, but instead chose to stay with us with a renewed passion for
            LOVE and a reminder that we all can and must pursue a pure
            life.’&nbsp;

          'That’s right; we're talking too much about money and too little about
          love. Our friend Ivo Valkenburg combined both in his book Spirit in
          Finance. Very worth reading. ' Willem Middelkoop, author, journalist,
          entrepreneur &amp; fund manager in News Flash Who are you still if
          you, as financial advisor, are almost bankrupt? That is what Ivo
          Valkenburg had to discover. This low point in his life earned him new
          insights. He now advocates the renewal of classical thought models in
          the financial sector and its practical applications. In his book '
          Pure Life ' he writes about his ideal: an economy built on love.
          Bonnie van Doorn, CHANGE Magazine (Belgium) Valkenburg’s latest book
          is an absolute must. Valkenburg goes in-depth to that oh-so-important
          value – or perhaps the most important value of all: love – in a way
          that touches the reader. And this value is so desperately needed in
          the financial world. Willem Vreeswijk, VVP Magazine for Financial
          Professionals (Netherlands) You don’t expect from a financial expert
          who is active in business for 30 years, that he himself experiences a
          financial crisis. Yet it happened to the Ivo Valkenburg. Despite
          embarrassment, fear and frustration he continued onwards and began
          writing about money, love and forgiveness. His mission: a society of
          love where people, companies and organizations integrate love into
          their daily activities. His first book Spirit in Finance was theory,
          his recently published book Pure Life is practice. Daniëlla Sloots,
          Bliss Magazine (Belgium) In his book Pure Life Valkenburg shows how
          love can help man to rise above the world of duality. Duality is
          called dvaita in Hinduism. A-dvaita stands for non-duality. Love can
          help us to discover our true self, our Atman, in the language of
          Hinduism. "Where people innovate," Valkenburg argues, "also renewal
          and vitality will occur in companies and organisations. Classical
          organizational and business models, based on fear, control and rules
          are being exchanged, step by step, for new structures based on
          meaning, freedom and autonomy. " Rinus van Warven, Radio 5
          (Netherlands) ‘An absolute must read! He challenges the reader, on the
          basis of examples and questions, to turn inward in yourself and go to
          the core. Because it’s all about that inner core. And that core is in
          us. ' Willem Vreeswijk, New Financial Magazine (Netherlands)
