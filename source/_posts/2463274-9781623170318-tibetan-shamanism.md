          Reflecting sixteen years of intensive fieldwork, this book is a rich
          chronicle of the daily lives, belief systems, and healing rituals of
          four highly revered Tibetan shamans forced into exile by the Chinese
          invasion during the 1950s. Larry Peters lived and studied closely with
          the shamans in Nepal, learning their belief system, observing and
          participating in their rituals, and introducing many dozens of
          students to their worldview. Including photographs of the shamans in
          ecstatic ritual and trance, this book—one of the most extensive
          ethnographic works ever done on Tibetan shamanism—captures the end of
          Tibetan shamanism while opening a window onto the culture and
          traditions that survived centuries of attack in Tibet, only to die out
          in Nepal.<br /><br />
          The violent treatment of shamans by the Buddhist lama has a long
          history in Tibet and neighboring Mongolia. At one point, shamans were
          burned at the stake. However, in the mountainous Himalayan terrain,
          especially in the difficult to reach areas geographically distant from
          the Buddhist monastic urban centers, shamans were respected and their
          work revered. Peters’s authoritative and meticulous research into the
          belief systems of these last surviving representatives of the shamanic
          traditions of the remote Himalayas preserves, in vivid detail, the
          techniques of ecstasy, described as pathways to the shamanic spiritual
          world.

          “A very interesting and important book by a major authority on
          contemporary Tibetan shamanism and on shamanism in general.&nbsp;He
          makes a contribution not just to shamanic studies, but to the
          preservation of the threatened spiritual heritage of the Tibetans
          themselves.”<br />

          “Larry Peters has devoted his life to studying Nepalese shamanism as
          both an anthropologist and as a practitioner, and so writes with a
          rare combination of deep personal experience and professional
          expertise.”<br />

          Tibetan shamanism.&nbsp;<i
            >Tibetan Shamanism: Ecstasy and Healing&nbsp;</i
          >is an ethnography of shamanic healing and the transmutation of soul
          in a Buddhist culture that ostensibly does not recognize the concept
          of soul.” &nbsp;<br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          “Larry Peters has an intimate knowledge of ecstatic healing methods
          among Tibetans and Nepalese, and his book shows how close he is to the
          shamans, and that he has an understanding of their reality made
          possible by extended field stays.&nbsp; I met many of the people
          Peters writes about during my stay in Nepal in 1970/’71 and meeting
          them again in&nbsp;<i>Tibetan Shamanism</i>&nbsp;is a most welcome
          experience.”<br />

          “I’ve known Dr. Larry Peters’s deep work on the shamanic healing
          practices of the Tibetan peoples for two decades.&nbsp;Professor
          Peters’s experiential knowledge of this healing tradition makes this
          book a must read for anyone interested in Tibetan shamanism or
          shamanism in general.”<br />
