            consecrated in a woman’s life—the deaths and the births of

            School of Theology and Psychology</b
          ><br /><br />Every woman wants wholeness—to be at home in her body, in
          her relationships, in her life. But women too often feel that they
          don’t belong to themselves. The path to wholeness, to a woman
          belonging to herself, is formidable, and women know they can’t travel
          it alone.&nbsp;<br /><br />Author, teacher, and therapist Dr. Christy
          Angelle Bauman has dedicated her life to guiding women on this path to
          meaning and profound joy.&nbsp;<br /><br />In <i>Her Rites</i>, Dr.
          Bauman takes you into her office and through six transformative
          exercises: a deep dive into the most common rites of passage in every
          woman’s life, when she sometimes loses hold of herself but also has a
          unique opportunity to reclaim herself.<br /><br />•
          <b>Birth:</b> claiming how and why you came into the world<br />•
          <b>Initiation:</b> coming of age<br />• <b>Exile:</b> finding
          yourself<br />• <b>Creation:</b> bringing something new into the
          world<br />• <b>Intuition:</b> acquiring embodied wisdom that comes
          later in life<br />• <b>Legacy:</b> living with emotional and
          spiritual readiness for one’s own death&nbsp;<br /><br />These rites
          help women to find wholeness and self-knowledge. Included in
          <i>Her Rites</i> are ritual templates and exercises that Dr. Bauman
          employs with her clients, which will help any woman incorporate the
          principles of self-reclamation into her daily life.<br /><br />Dr.
          Bauman has seen again and again that by learning to pause and to
          reflect on these key moments, we can come home to ourselves and
          receive the gift of flourishing.

          it, to wrestle with it, to sit and be still with all the God moments
          it brings. I emerged from <i>Her Rites</i> lighter, more confident,
          and better able to listen to my body. I am grateful.”<b
