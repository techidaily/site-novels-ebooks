          An illustrated guide to the occult history, serpent magic, and
          practical application of the I Ching <br /><br />• Reveals how the
          sacred language of the original eight trigrams of the I Ching was
          discovered by a wisdom serpent known as Fu Xi <br /><br />• Explores
          how the I Ching formed the basis of the earliest Taoist philosophies,
          its complex correlation with human DNA, and its relationship with
          artificial intelligence <br /><br />• Provides new contemporary
          analysis of each of the 64 hexagrams, their changing lines, and
          archetypes of the I Ching <br /><br />• Includes original artwork
          highlighting the serpent magic within the system and tools to help you
          interpret the I Ching based on your own individual experience
          <br /><br />One of the oldest books in the world, the I Ching has been
          used in China for millennia to open a dialogue with divinity, gain
          insight and wisdom, and pull aside the curtain of reality to reveal
          the light of the heavens. Yet, despite its popularity over thousands
          of years, few understand its mysterious origins, symbolism, or occult
          connections. <br /><br />In this illustrated guide, Maja D’Aoust
          applies her significant experience as a professional practitioner and
          scholar of the I Ching to provide a history of the oracle, explain the
          mechanisms at work behind it, and offer a new experiential approach to
          its interpretation. The author begins by examining the discovery of
          the I Ching by the first mythical emperor of China, Fu Xi, a divine
          being with the body of a serpent. She reveals how Fu Xi’s eight
          original trigrams, also called the Ba Gua, provided a sacred language
          of symbols that allowed for communication between the diviner and the
          spirit world. Using the I Ching’s principles of cosmology as a basis,
          the shamans of ancient China developed the earliest Taoist
          philosophies of nature, medicine, martial arts, and mathematics as
          well as ecstatic practices, war strategies, birth and death rituals,
          agricultural systems, and alchemical studies. D’Aoust further shows
          how the I Ching relates to the mathematical sequences of biology and
          human DNA, examining the correlation between the serpent’s tail and
          the double helix. She reveals how the ways the oracle connects with
          your own inner knowing parallel the ways in which DNA repairs itself.
          <br /><br />Providing a new analysis of each of the 64 hexagrams and
          their changing lines and archetypes, the author explores each
          hexagram’s meanings in depth, alongside original artwork highlighting
          the serpent magic within the system and tools to help you interpret
          the I Ching based on your own individual experience. Revealing how the
          oracle holds complex networks of meaning that language alone fails to
          capture, D’Aoust offers a new understanding of the Book of Changes and
          its many hidden lessons.

          “In an extraordinary piece of esoteric scholarship, Maja D’Aoust has
          crafted one of the most intriguing investigations of the I Ching you
          are ever likely to read. Like many such examinations,
          <i>The Occult I Ching</i> contains a complete presentation of the
          oracle itself, but it is in her exploration of I Ching history that
          D’Aoust shines brightest. Her presentation of evidence for a
          connection between the I Ching and DNA is worth the cover price on its
          own. Highly recommended.”
