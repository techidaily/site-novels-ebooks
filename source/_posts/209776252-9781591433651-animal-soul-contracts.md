          A guide to discovering the spiritual agreements between our souls and
          those of our animal companions <br /><br />• 2021 Coalition of
          Visionary Resources Gold Award <br /><br />• Explains how animals have
          physical or behavioral issues to evolve their souls as well as help
          our soul’s evolution and release past-life karma <br /><br />•
          Describes what happens energetically and spiritually with animals in
          the weeks before they transition and during their passing
          <br /><br />• Includes practical instructions for identifying the
          different types of animal soul contracts and aligning with them to
          assist your shared evolutionary journey <br /><br />Animal lovers are
          extraordinary. Despite awareness that we will probably outlive our
          beloved pets, we are still drawn, time and time again, to the
          connection, joy, and unconditional love that come with sharing our
          lives, homes, and laps with animals. Many of us feel something deeper
          than just companionship with our animal friends--a heart-to-heart
          connection felt all the way to the soul level. <br /><br />Revealing
          the higher purpose and soul mission behind our relationships with our
          animal companions, Tammy Billups explores the spiritual contracts that
          are created when a human bonds with an animal and shows how we come
          into each other’s lives for a reason. Providing real-life examples,
          Billups explains why animals choose, at the soul level, to have
          certain perceived negative experiences, such as physical or behavioral
          issues, to evolve their souls, clear karma, and help our soul’s
          evolution. She shows that human and animal souls orchestrate every
          experience and interaction that holds potential for transformation and
          healing, including the final transition. She demonstrates the inner
          dynamics of the animal-human relationship to help animal lovers
          understand their soul contracts with their pets. The inspirational,
          real-life examples of animal-human tandem healings that Billups
          facilitated identify the soul contracts within each pairing that
          transformed feelings of grief, loss, abandonment, betrayal, trauma,
          abuse, and anxiety. <br /><br />The author reveals how animals we have
          previously loved and shared our lives with come back, either on the
          spirit level or reincarnated in a new animal form, to support us.
          Offering peace and hope to those who’ve lost beloved animal
          companions, she describes what she’s witnessed during healing sessions
          with animals in the weeks before they transition and during their
          passing. Billups also includes practical instructions for identifying
          different types of animal soul contracts and connecting with and
          enlisting the help of your light team or spirit guides. <br /><br />By
          discovering the soul agreements that underlie our animal partnerships,
          we can find meaning in the issues that arise with our animals and
          ourselves, support our souls’ mutual evolution, and allow the soul
          contracts to weave their spiritual magic in the animal-human
          relationship.

          "<i>Animal Soul Contracts</i> unravels the physical, social,
          emotional, spiritual, and mental connection that we unconsciously form
          with our animal friends that reinforces our “mirroring” of each
          other’s predispositions. Whereas animal whisperers merely help animals
          with people problems, Ms. Billups helps both in a holistic approach.
          Animal Soul Contracts is a new take in inter-species communication
          that affirms that our pets are unmistakably our equals."
