            Through John Wheeler and other influential teachers, and through his
            two books of dialogues, Sailor Bob Adamson has become a familiar
            name to those interested in non-dual spirituality. With assistance
            from friends and family, and from Bob himself, Kalyani Lawry has
            compiled an absorbing account of his life illustrated with
            photographs from Bob's personal collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of <i>Only That</i> consists of dialogues which have
            an immediacy that is “closer than your breathing, nearer than your
            hands and feet” and a depth that reflects Bob's life experience
            while pointing clearly to the ultimate reality, “Thou art That”.

          “Sailor Bob Adamson pointed out very directly that I was not the
          limited person I had assumed myself to be. To this day, I marvel at
          the clarity, effectiveness, and thoroughness of Bob's pointers. I am
          deeply touched by the great kindness and warmth of heart he shares
          with those who seek his guidance. Following the advice of his teacher
          Nisargadatta Maharaj, Bob has genuinely helped many former seekers by
          putting them beyond the need of any further help. His impact on the
          world of non-dual spirituality has been immense and continues to
          grow.”<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Kalyani Lawry</b> lives in Melbourne, Australia, and first met
          Sailor Bob Adamson in 1974 and again in India in 1976. In reconnecting
          with him in 2006, the remnants of a sense of separation dissipated.
          Following Bob’s encouragement, she began to pass on the same message
          that Nisargadatta Maharaj had passed on to him. As a counselor and
          mentor known for the warmth of her work, Kalyani offers private
          conversations on non-duality. Her most recent book is
          <i>A Sprinkling of Jewels</i>.
