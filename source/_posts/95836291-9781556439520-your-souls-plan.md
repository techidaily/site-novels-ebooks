          Would you like to understand the deeper spiritual meaning of physical
          illness, parenting handicapped children, drug addiction, alcoholism,
          the death of a loved one, accidents, deafness, and blindness?<br />&nbsp;<br /><i
            >Your Soul’s Plan</i
          >
          (which was originally published under the title
          <i>Courageous Souls: Do We Plan Our Life Challenges Before Birth?</i>)
          explores the premise that we are all eternal souls who plan our lives,
          including our greatest challenges, <i>before we are born</i> for the
          purpose of spiritual growth. Through compelling profiles of people who
          knowingly planned the experiences mentioned above,
          <i>Your Soul’s Plan</i> shows that suffering is not purposeless, but
          rather imbued with deep meaning. Working with four gifted mediums,
          author Robert Schwartz reveals the significance of each person’s life
          plan and allows us a fascinating look into the “other side.”<br /><br />Each
          personal story focuses on a specific life challenge, organized by type
          for easy reference. Accessible both to those familiar with the
          metaphysical aspects of spirituality and to the general reader, the
          moving narratives that comprise <i>Your Soul’s Plan</i> help readers
          awaken to the reality that they are transcendent, eternal souls. With
          this stirring book as a guide, feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,
          and victimization are healed and transformed into acceptance,
          forgiveness, gratitude, and peace. <br /><br />Robert Schwartz is also
          the author of
          <i
            >Your Soul’s Gift: The Healing Power of the Life You Planned Before
            You Were Born</i
          >, which explores the pre-birth planning of spiritual awakening,
          miscarriage, abortion, caregiving, abusive relationships, sexuality,
          incest, adoption, poverty, suicide, rape, and mental illness. There’s
          also a chapter about the pre-birth planning we do with our future
          pets.<br />&nbsp;<br />Robert Schwartz is a hypnotherapist who offers
          general Spiritual Guidance Sessions, Past Life Soul Regressions, and
          Between Lives Soul Regressions. Visit Robert online at

          “The more we know about the meaning of life, the better we understand
          the important choices we must make. Robert Schwartz has done an
          excellent job of presenting the possible explanations of what we are
          doing here and why we are here. I highly recommend this book.”<br />—Dannion
          Brinkley, author of <i>Saved by the Light</i> and
          <i>The Secrets of the Light</i><br /><br />“<i>Your Soul’s Plan</i> is
          a deeply insightful guide as to why our lives unfold as they do and
          how to direct them to a deeper place. A powerful book . . . I highly
          recommend it.”<br />—Sonia Choquette, author of
          <i>The Answer is Simple . . . Love Yourself, Live Your Spirit!</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Your Soul’s Plan</i> is one of the most detailed
          explorations I have seen into understanding why we have chosen certain
          paths in our lives and how we may use that information to continue our
          journey as a soul here and now. This book will help thousands of
          people. A book you HAVE to have in your library!"<br />—John Holland,
          author of <i>Born Knowing </i>and <i>Power of the Soul </i
          ><br /><br />“Schwartz provides a very special sense of seeing divine
          order everywhere… <i>Your Soul's Plan</i> provides a fabulous and
          much-needed compass for those of us seeking to regain the deeper
          awareness of our core spiritual strength. Highly recommended!”<br />—<i
            >New Consciousness Review</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Your Soul's Plan</i> is highly recommended to anyone
          trying to understand the suffering, tragedy or loss that has caused
          them to question life, death and/or God. And who among us is not
          inflicted by such challenges and questions in our lifetime? In my
          eight years researching life after death, spirituality and life
          purpose, I have discovered no better explanation of why human
          challenges exist than what is so eloquently written in Robert
          Schwartz's book.”<br />—Bob Olson, OfSpirit.com Editor<br /><br />"The
          serene cover of <i>Your&nbsp;Soul's Plan</i> belies the punch with
          which Robert Schwartz communicates the results of his research into
          pre-birth planning . . . Overall, it is one of the best books of this
          kind I have come across."<br />—Anna Jedrziewski,

        </h4>
        <p>
          In a personal session with a medium in 2003, author Robert Schwartz
          was astonished to speak with nonphysical beings who knew everything
          about him—not just what he had done in life, but also what he had
          thought and felt. They told him that he had planned many of his most
          difficult experiences before he was born. Realizing that a knowledge
          of pre-birth planning would bring great healing to people and allow
          them to understand the deeper purpose of their life challenges, he
          devoted the next three years to studying the pre-birth plans of dozens
          of individuals. The extraordinary insights that emerged speak to our
          heartfelt, universal yearning to know . . . why.<br /><br />Mr.
          Schwartz holds a BA in psychology from Dartmouth College and an MBA
          from the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve
          University. He has worked as a freelance journalist for publications
          such as <i>Life, </i>and initially self-published
          <i>Your Soul's Plan</i> under the title,
          <i>Courageous Souls: Do We Plan Our Life Challenges Before Birth?</i>.
          He regularly speaks on the subject of pre-birth planning at venues
          across the United States and maintains a companion Web site at
          www.YourSoulsPlan.com.
