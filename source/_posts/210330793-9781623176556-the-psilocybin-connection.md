            >A comprehensive guide to psilocybin mushrooms and their impact on
            our psychology, biology, and social development.</b
          ><br /><br />How—and why—do psychedelics exist? Did psilocybin
          catalyze our early human ancestors’ social evolution? And how can an
          integral understanding of psychedelics quite literally change the
          world?<br />&nbsp;<br />In an ambitious and comprehensive look at
          psilocybin—and an inside look at how humanity co-evolved alongside
          "magic" mushrooms—Jahan Khamsehzadeh, PhD, explores our historical and
          ancestral relationship to psychedelics and presents new and exciting
          research about what psilocybin can mean for us today.<br />&nbsp;<br />Separated
          into three sections—Present, Past, and Future—<i
            >The&nbsp;Psilocybin Connection</i
          >
          advances our understanding of psychedelics in unexpected and original
          ways. Khamsehzadeh shares compelling research that suggests how
          naturally occurring psychedelics may have played an essential role in
          humanity's social, cultural, and linguistic evolution. Supported by
          archaeological evidence, neuroscience, and academic studies, he
          explores how mushrooms gave rise to art and expression, impacted
          spiritual experiences, and even spurred human brain development.<br />&nbsp;<br />Blending
          the most comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of psilocybin research
          with stories of his own and others' psychedelic awakenings,
          Khamsehzadeh moves our understanding of the psychedelic mushroom
          forward toward a fresh, hopeful, and exciting future.

          "This book’s blend of scholarship, erudition, and imagination makes
          a&nbsp;compelling argument that huan evolution, even the enlargement
          of our brains, has been due in part to psilocybin mushrooms and their
          effects on perception, cognition, and imagination.
          [Khamsezadeh's]&nbsp;scholarly perspective is persuasive, optimistic,
          and a pleasure to read."<br />—JAMES FADIMAN, PhD, microdose
          researcher and author of <i>The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide</i
          ><br /><br />"<i>The Psilocybin Connection</i> explores how the
          psychedelic renaissance impacts lives across the planet. Khamsezadeh
          compiles compelling scientific research, provocative theories, and
          bold visions for the evolutionary role of psychedelics. Reading this
          book will expand your mind without any chemical compounds. And it just
          might inspire you to engage the territory yourself."&nbsp;<br />—ADAM
          B. LEONARD, coauthor of <i>Integral Life Practice</i
          ><br /><br />"Having been trained in both worlds, Dr. Khamsehzadeh
          weaves psychedelic Western cultural history with Indigenous wisdom
          traditions. This book demonstrates a clear integration of passion,
          scholarship, and a healthy dose of wonder—an elixir for those seeking
          to connect with the mystery that’s woven into not only our human lives
          but also the very fabric of the cosmos."<br />—KILE ORTIGO, PhD,
          author of <i>Beyond the Narrow Life</i><br /><br />"This book is the
          single most comprehensive on the subject of psilocybin mushrooms that
          I’ve come across in twenty-plus years of exploring the subject.
          Regardless of your level of knowledge or experience, [this] book is
          accessible, inviting, inspiring, and incredibly informative. This will
          be my go-to recommendation when anyone asks me any question about the
          history, use, science, or potential of psilocybin mushrooms."<br />—MICHAEL
          ROESSLEIN, MS, FDN-P, holistic health and wellness educator and
          founder of Inaura<br /><br />"The perfect story for anyone trying to
          more deeply understand the role of psychedelics in human civilization,
          myth, and the future of human evolution—absolutely
          brilliant!"&nbsp;<br />—MATT MCKIBBIN, cofounder of the
          CryptoPsychedelic Summit and founder of DecentraNet<br /><br />"Khamsehzadeh
          offers a comprehensive overview of sacred mushrooms and psilocybin,
          their history, and their meaningful place in our lives as a
          species.&nbsp; <br /><i>The Psilocybin Connection</i> reads like a
          transmission anchored in the historical, philosophical, and societal
          facets of sacred mushrooms and psilocybin, while bringing us closer to
          [the author's] personal views on life, existence, and the
          transcendent."&nbsp;<br />—FRANCOISE BOURZAT, author of<i>
            Consciousness Medicine<br /></i
          ><br />"A unique overview of the rare knowledge that can be obtained
          through deep inner journeys, reflective meditations, and a careful
          study of the science and history of the sacred mushroom. Rooted in a
          foundation of humanistic and transpersonal psychology, Khamsehzadeh
          weaves together a beautiful alchemical tapestry—overflowing with
          treasured revelations and valuable psychological insights. Most highly
          recommended."&nbsp;<br />—DAVID JAY BROWN, author of
