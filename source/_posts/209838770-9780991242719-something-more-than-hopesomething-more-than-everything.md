          Written in the spirit of Norman Cousins' "Anatomy of an Illness" and
          Jill Bolte Taylor's "My Stroke of Insight", this book will forever
          change your thinking about the depth of our capacity to heal and heal
          one another. When Diana Lindsay couldn't blow out the candles on her
          birthday cake, she never imagined that it was because of stage IV lung
          cancer. Given a prognosis of just three to six months to live, she
          also never imagined that eight years later she and her husband would
          be sharing their highly improbable and unexpectedly joyful story of
          how they returned her to complete health. In 2006, the odds of Diana
          living long enough to see her newborn granddaughter enter kindergarten
          were one in a hundred. "How do I make it into the 1% Club?" she asks
          herself and steps into an assumption-challenging alternate future with
          her husband Kelly. Recognizing she will have to be willing to try what
          99% wouldn't, Diana relentlessly pursues the latest medical
          technologies and opens her mind to a range of integrative therapies,
          including medical Qigong and Reiki. But it is her creativity with the
          ancient protocols of love, joy, and wonder---and how she and Kelly
          turn them into a Love-In, a Gratitude Tour, and a 48-state road trip
          in a Prius with a queen-size mattress in the back---that will surprise
          and delight you. This is not cancer-as-you-know-it. Despite the
          copious research Diana clearly presents, she recognizes that the
          longer the odds of survival, the shorter the medical evidence on which
          to base decisions. So she learns to "Skype" her own cells, and with
          astonishing clarity and prescience they guide her through medical and
          life decisions that bring her to much more than health. With
          unwavering love and often humorous storytelling, Kelly asks his own
          questions as Diana's primary caretender: "What do I do now? What can I
          do now? Can I win a bare-knuckles fight with my results-oriented mind
          to embrace the unknown? Can I cross the bridge to Woo-Woo without
          burning it?" Cross it he does, even learning to exhort his own cells
          when he too is diagnosed with cancer years later. This two-in-one
          book, combining both the patient and caretender perspectives, is a
          story of spirit and creativity. It offers any of us the encouragement
          to take advantage of something more than hope in the face of life
          crisis as well as the possibility of giving up---and astonishingly
          getting back---something more than everything. Advance
          Praise---------------------------------------------- "A remarkable
          story that deserves to be told and re-told." --Elizabeth George, New
          York Times best-selling author "Diana and Kelly Lindsay have written a
          remarkable account of Diana's exceptional recovery from stage 4 lung
          cancer. They faced daunting odds with fierce intentionality and a wise
          integration of conventional and integrative therapies. Above all, they
          understand the healing power of love. A beautiful story, well told."
          --Michael Lerner, President and Founder, Commonweal, author of Choices
          in Healing "Diana and Kelly's moving journeys in the face of cancer
          affirm that miracles are made - not with blueprints or instruction
          manuals, but with courage, intuition, intelligence and abiding love.
          The honesty, humor and insights embedded in each chapter are unique to
          them as patient and caretaker, wife and husband, yet universal in
          their depiction of the human heart as it opens and closes and opens
          again to the onslaught of life in all its rawness and beauty. For
          those with a life-threatening illness and their loved ones, this book
          is like a dear friend at your side, reminding you that you are not
          alone, whatever your path may be." --Elise Miller, Med, Director,
          Collaborative on Health and the Environment
