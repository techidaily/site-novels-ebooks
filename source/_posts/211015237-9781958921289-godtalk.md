          <p><strong>Begin Your Conversation with God</strong></p>
          <p>
            Don't look now, but God is talking with you. In fact, God is never
            not talking with you! Neale Donald Walsch, NY Times bestselling
            author of Conversations with God, invites you to be present to life
            and the experience of your talks with God. He shares how God talks
            to you in a hundred ways across a thousand moments, using feelings,
            words, images, ideas, metaphors, and events that can change your
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experience Neale's classic wit as he shares his famous 5-word
            statement from God - You've got me all wrong - for a 21st-century
            audience... with a modern-day twist.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find out how God can suddenly reveal Itself in unexpected,
            unforgettable, mysterious, and miraculous ways, leaving behind a
            powerful message that touches you continuously for the rest of your
            days. Feel the wonder as Neale Donald Walsch, along with our sacred
            storytellers, share their talks with God, including those of:

          I wish this was a required book to read as our relationship and
          understanding of "God" would completely change and we would finally
          receive a "true" concept of God from a human perspective.
