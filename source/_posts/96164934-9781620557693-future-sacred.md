          Reveals how our survival depends on embracing complexity consciousness
          and relating to nature and all life as sacred <br /><br />• Rejects
          the “survival of the fittest” narrative in favor of sacred symbiosis,
          creative cooperation, interdependence and complex thinking
          <br /><br />• Provides examples from complexity studies, cultural
          history, philosophy, indigenous spirituality, biomimicry, and ecology
          to show how nature’s intelligence and creativity abound everywhere
          <br /><br />• Documents how indigenous cultures lived in relative
          harmony with nature because they perceived themselves as part of the
          “ordered whole” of all life <br /><br />In <i>Future Sacred</i>, Julie
          J. Morley offers a new perspective on the human connection to the
          cosmos by unveiling the connected creativity and sacred intelligence
          of nature. She rejects the “survival of the fittest” narrative--the
          idea that survival requires strife--and offers symbiosis and
          cooperation as nature’s path forward. She shows how an increasingly
          complex world demands increasingly complex consciousness. Our survival
          depends upon embracing “complexity consciousness,” understanding
          ourselves as part of nature, as well as relating to nature as sacred.
          <br /><br />Morley begins by documenting how indigenous cultures lived
          in relative harmony with nature because they perceived themselves as
          part of the “ordered whole” of all life--until modernity introduced
          dualistic thinking, thus separating mind from matter, and humans from
          nature. The author deconstructs the fallacy behind social and
          neo-Darwinism and the materialist theories of “dead matter” versus
          those that offer a connection with the sentient mind of nature. She
          presents evidence from complexity studies, cultural history,
          philosophy, indigenous spirituality, biomimicry, and ecology,
          highlighting the idea that nature’s intelligence and creativity abound
          everywhere--from cells to cetaceans, from hydrogen to humans, from
          sunflowers to solar panels--and that all sentient beings contribute to
          the evolution of life as a whole, working together in sacred
          symbiosis. <br /><br />Morley concludes that our sacred future depends
          on compassionately understanding and integrating multiple
          intelligences, seeing relationships and interdependence as fundamental
          and sacred, as well as honoring the experiences of all sentient
          beings. Instead of “mastery over nature,” we must shift toward synergy
          with nature--and with each other as diverse expressions of nature’s
          creativity.

          engaging argument for bringing the sacred into all our world-making
          endeavors. She invites us to re-awaken to our cosmic connectedness,
          re-enchant our present and future, and create possibility in the face
          of crisis. Timely and essential reading."
