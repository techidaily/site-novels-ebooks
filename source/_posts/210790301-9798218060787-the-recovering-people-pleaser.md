          <p>
            Are you tired of giving more than you get, being taken for granted,
            treated disrespectfully or worse, being used or abused?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Why do some people naturally attract loving and respectful
            relationships, while others consistently attract dysfunctional,
            lopsided, or toxic ones? What is that "secret something" that others
            possess that keeps eluding you?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In The Recovering People Pleaser, Kristen Brown masterfully takes
            the reader on a journey of discovery to identify the root cause of
            people pleasing, why the pattern persists and the "miracle cure" to
            break free from it for good! Kristen has a prolific ability to
            transform complex material into a teaching style that is easy to
            understand, absorb and apply. She also includes vulnerable excerpts
            from her own personal story, which add a brilliant nuance of
            relatability that promotes the reader to feel seen and understood.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            As a recovering People Pleaser herself, Kristen Brown understands
            the fear of being disliked, the innate desire to nurture others and
            the concern of becoming selfish. The good news is the cure for
            people pleasing will not fundamentally change who you are. You will
            not stop being the lover, giver, and Earth angel that you enjoy
            being. You'll simply become a more authentic, confident, and
            empowered version of your highest self who knows how to balance the
            needs of others with the needs of self.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In The Recovering People Pleaser, you'll discover how to:</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>• Set and maintain healthy boundaries with grace and confidence</p>
          <p>
            • Identify and heal subconscious programming that promotes approval
            seeking
          </p>
          <p>• Conquer fears and limiting beliefs that hold you back</p>
          <p>
            • Upgrade your energetic vibration to attract higher vibe people to
            you
          </p>
          <p>• Break free from codependency to become interdependent</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Kristen Brown knows firsthand that if we don't change the way we
            show up to relationships, our relationships won't change.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The Recovering People Pleaser will help you transform your painful
            and debilitating relationship tendencies to reclaim your personal
            power and love others without losing yourself. You are worthy of
            being treated with the utmost of love, respect, and honor. It is
            your birthright and it's time to claim it.

          Kristen Brown is a gifted author and teacher who is incredibly real
          and relatable. I started reading The Recovering People Pleaser and I
          couldn't put it down! It is by far the best material I've read on this
          topic. This book is elegantly written to keep giving every time you
          read it. Huge kudos to Kristen for her masterful work!

          If there is only one book to read that will change your life, it
          should be this one. If you suffer from people pleasing you are holding
          the key that will set you free. Written with heart, wisdom and grace,
          Kristen Brown will give you the tools and tough love you need to
          transform all your relationships.

          As a recovering People Pleaser, I was anxiously awaiting the release
          of Kristen Brown's new book The Recovering People Pleaser. And boy
          does Kristen deliver a power punch of a message about how to attract
          the love we all deserve. Her raw and personal accounts of growing up a
          People Pleaser will help millions of human beings stop living their
          lives for others and start living and creating their own unique lives,
          filled with joy and love. I highly recommend this book to anyone who
          just can't quite figure out why they've not yet attracted the love and
          the people they're longing for. Two thumbs up, 5 stars, and a top
          rating on any other rating scale as far as I am concerned!

          There are many (so-called) experts in the field of self-love, personal
          development, and relationship healing. However, there's no one with
          the compassion, empathy, wisdom, understanding, grace, and
          down-to-earth presence as Kristen Brown. Hearing her speak, and
          reading her words, makes you feel like she knows exactly how it feels
          to struggle through life and difficult relationships to come out on
          the other side a more whole, blessed, and fulfilled person. It's easy
          to consider her a friend and ally in this journey we're on in
          self-discovery. Having the honor of being her friend, I've gotten to
          witness and experience her incredible transformation superpowers in
          countless people's lives. This book provides the playbook to truly
          take your life, your heart, and your relationships to amazing and
          beautiful places where Love isn't a fantasy. It's a reality that's
          better than you could ask for or imagine.
