        <p>
          Sometimes it’s impossible to capture the magnitude of a books message
          within the few words of its title. Secrets of Success is one of those
          books, and one of those titles. Through fourteen laser-clear chapters,
          Sandra Anne Taylor and Sharon Klingler masterfully guide us on an
          expedition into the world of a spiritually-based science. Our reward
          for embracing the journey comes quickly through personal "ah ha’s"
          that range from the profound to the miraculous. Using a brilliant
          series of "self-investigative processes," Taylor helps us zero in on
          the source of our life circumstances, as well as how to change the
          ones we don’t like. As we recognize the link between our personal
          world view and the undeniable facts of out lives, we also recognize
          the secret of fulfillment that stays with us long after we close the
          pages of her book. The bottom line: If you’re ready to move beyond the
          theory of how your heart’s desire becomes the reality of your world,
          this book is your action plan for success!<br />--Gregg Braden, New
          York Times best selling author of The God Code, The Divine Matrix, and
          The Spontaneous Healing of Belief
