            >When Jeffrey Wands was six years old, he met his great grandmother
            Mary. She had been dead for twenty-three years.</b
          ><br /><br /><b
            >Gifted psychic Jeffrey Wands's connection with his great
            grandmother was the first step in a remarkable journey that has led
            to his current status as one of the most acclaimed and successful
            psychics in the country.</b
          >
          Now, in <i>The Psychic in You,</i> he traces his development as a
          psychic and describes what it's like to grow up with such an
          extraordinary gift. Using a series of compelling and dramatic
          anecdotes, he illustrates the joys -- and the pain -- that this
          faculty has brought him.<br />
          <br /><i>The Psychic in You</i> is a book of incredible stories told
          in the most down-to-earth and readable way. And underpinning this
          exceptional narrative is Jeffrey Wands's belief that all of us have
          psychic capabilities, and that all of us can -- and should -- try to
          develop them. A fascinating read full of dramatic accounts of the
          paranormal, <i>The Psychic in You</i> includes information on:<br />
          <br />• Unleashing your own psychic ability<br />
          • Contacting loved ones who have crossed over<br />
          • Understanding the dead<br />
          • Freeing yourself from pain and negativity<br />
          • Handling fear of the dead<br />
          <br />Captivating, yet practical, this highly readable book dispels
          the myths and superstitions that surround psychic phenomena and
          provides a decidedly down-to-earth look at communicating with the
          other side. Enlightening and absorbing, <i>The Psychic in You</i> is
          essential reading for anyone seeking a richer, more insightful life.
