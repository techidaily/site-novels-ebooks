            >“[The authors] have, like each whistleblower before them, paid a
            price for their&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. amplification of the
            truth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The most profound event in human
            history.” —Joseph G. Buchman, Ph.D, moderator for the Citizen

          ><br /><br />Two of the world’s leading investigators declare
          definitively that the Roswell Incident happened and present their
          closing arguments.<br /><br />For more than seventy years, the crash
          at Roswell and its ensuing controversies and cover-ups have been
          investigated. Yet despite continually mounting evidence, there are
          still disbelievers. <i>Roswell: The Ultimate Cold Case</i> is Carey
          and Schmitt’s final and commanding word on the case in which they
          declare victory once and for all.<br /><br />The government has
          changed their official story on Roswell more than a dozen times, but
          the witnesses have not recanted. The evidence has not gone away. And
          won’t go away. The Roswell Incident is the most hotly debated and
          investigated UFO crash in history with seemingly endless evidence, and
          eyewitnesses coming forward even years later. Finally, late in life
          people feel safe enough or feel duty bound to reveal what they know,
          saw, and heard.<br /><br /><i>Roswell: The Ultimate Cold Case</i> will
          bring all new exclusive eye witness testimonies to light as well as
          cover the:Connection of astronauts Edgar Mitchell and Neil Armstrong
          to Roswell.Connection of Clinton, Carter, Goldwater, Schiff, and
          Richardson to Roswell.First time artist conception of impact site with
          craft and bodies based on firsthand testimony.First time full-size
          model of crash survivor based on eyewitness testimony.And more
          eyewitness corroboration.<br /><br />“There is no one on this planet
          who knows more about the Roswell incident than these two guys.” —Larry
          Landsman, director of special projects for the Syfy Channel
