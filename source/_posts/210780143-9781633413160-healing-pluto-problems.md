            >Discover how understanding Pluto in your birth chart can help you
            understand aspects of your childhood, adulthood, and your life.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>Healing Pluto Problems</i>, Donna Cunningham explains how Pluto
          functions in the birth chart and shows how Plutonian problems can
          manifest throughout one’s life. Pluto’s energy is extremely potent and
          powerful. In astrology, it is considered a “generational planet”—the
          length of its orbit (248 years) means it influences both individuals
          and entire generations as it travels through the zodiac. Cunningham
          shows how transiting Pluto aspects can affect childhood, adulthood,
          and life in general.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Symbolically, Pluto governs our compulsive behavior—all those things
          we know we shouldn’t do but feel compelled to do anyway.
          <b
            >It also represents the hidden dimension of our emotional lives, all
            the parts of ourselves that we’d rather bury in our subconscious and
            not reveal to others. </b
          >With numerous case studies to bring her insights to life,
          Cunningham’s interpretations, written with care and compassion, are
          straightforward and easy to grasp. She presents her material with
          warmth and empathy, without avoiding the tough lessons that Pluto has
          to offer.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Cunningham addresses such topics as Guilt, resentment, and fear
          Emotional secrets and their contribution to self-isolation Incest,
          abuse, and domestic violence Pluto and the need for power and control
          The psychology of being a victim Death and transformation The
          consequences of avoiding grief &nbsp;<br />
          Interested not only in diagnosing Pluto problems, Cunningham also
          gives us tools for healing those problems—affirmations, flower
          remedies, exercises for working with the chakras—and shows us how to
          use Pluto transits for growth.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This Weiser Classics edition includes a foreword by Lisa Stardust,
          author of <i>Saturn Return Survival Guide.</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br /><b
            >“In astrology, Pluto represents destruction and creation. Pluto is
            a dwarf planet that is always pushing us to evolve and grow so that
            we align with the times and themes of our lives. This ultimate,
            evolutionary experience brings us to our truest selves. As lord of
            the underworld, Pluto represents the juxtaposition between life and
            death—that which defines transformation.&nbsp;<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            “Donna Cunningham’s<i> Healing Pluto Problems </i>was the first book
            I read on Pluto. It helped me comprehend the depths and significance
            of Pluto and how to use the planet to my advantage. Also, it gave me
            a chance to see myself clearly and understand my feelings. Not only
            that, but I gained insight into my relationships. I can honestly say
            that I have become a more mature and self-aware person from reading
            this book. Now I know why I act out when pushed to the limit and how
            to temper myself when I begin to seek such actions.”<br />
