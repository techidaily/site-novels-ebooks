          A hands-on guide to the vibrational signatures of the food we eat and
          how they affect our behaviors, emotions, and spirit <br /><br />•
          Details the energetic and spiritual qualities of more than 400 common
          foods, revealing how each affects you on multiple levels, how a food’s
          color plays a role, which chakra it resonates with, and how to
          interpret cravings and aversions <br /><br />• Explains how to use
          your diet to fine-tune your energetic body, remove negative energy
          patterns, and consciously craft a positive state for body, mind, and
          soul <br /><br />• Includes a selection of recipes with their
          energetic interpretations <br /><br />• Provides exercises to help you
          identify the vibrational meaning of your current diet and deepen your
          relationship with the food you eat<br /><br />Most of us are familiar
          with the physical health benefits of fruits, vegetables, meats, herbs,
          and spices and their nutritional effects on the human body. It is well
          known, for example, that turmeric is a powerful anti-inflammatory and
          carrots significantly improve eyesight, but what about the vibrational
          benefits of foods? How does our diet affect the energy body and our
          emotional, mental, and spiritual states? <br /><br />In this
          comprehensive guide to vibrational nutrition, Candice Covington
          explores the vibrational signatures of the foods we eat and how they
          help form the energetic structures that influence our behaviors and
          spirit. She explains how, by choosing foods that resonate with your
          natural vibrational patterns, you can use your diet to fine-tune your
          energetic body, remove negative energy patterns, and consciously craft
          a positive state for body, mind, and soul. She details the energetic
          and spiritual qualities of more than 400 common foods, drinks, and
          seasonings, including a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, nuts,
          eggs, mushrooms, grains, seafood, poultry, other proteins, tea, wine,
          and both cooking herbs and medicinal herbs. She explores how each food
          affects you on multiple levels, how a food’s color determines which
          chakra it resonates with and how to work with dreams to decode the
          divine role of foods in your life. The author explains how to
          interpret food cravings and aversions on an emotional and spiritual
          level and provides exercises to help you identify the vibrational
          meaning of your current diet. <br /><br />Offering a selection of
          recipes along with interpretations of their energetic stories,
          Covington explores how to intuitively select foods and food
          combinations to reinforce your energy patterns, support you in any
          endeavor, and provide nutrition for body, mind, and spirit.
