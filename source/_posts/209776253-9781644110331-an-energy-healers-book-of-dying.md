          A compassionate guidebook to the energetic stages of dying and how to
          offer practical support at each stage of the transition back to spirit
          <br /><br />• Explains the nine energetic levels of dying and what is
          happening during each stage, including how belief systems and energy
          blocks can affect the death process <br /><br />• Reveals what the
          dying person may see and experience, what to watch for in each stage,
          and specific ways to support your loved one during each phase
          <br /><br />• Explores the grieving process and offers helpful
          strategies for moving through it <br /><br />Written by a highly
          skilled intuitive energy worker, this compassionate guide reveals what
          is happening energetically during the transition back to spirit and
          details how to provide support in any phase of losing a loved one:
          before death, during the dying process, and afterward. Taking readers
          step-by-step through the nine energetic levels of dying, author
          Suzanne Worthley explains what is happening at each level or dimension
          energetically, what to watch for in each stage, and specific ways in
          which we can support our loved ones through their transition back to
          spirit. For each of the nine stages, she describes what the dying
          person may see and experience, including the stages of transition at
          which people undergo the familiar elements of near-death experiences,
          such as entering a tunnel, conducting a life review, or encountering
          angels, guides, loved ones in spirit, or a bright light. She explores
          what family members and friends may see and experience, such as spirit
          energy, and what they can do to offer practical support and emotional
          solace to their loved one. <br /><br />Examining how life force energy
          works as well as what Akashic records and soul contracts are, Worthley
          shares hospice case studies for each level of transition, so
          caregivers can see how belief systems and energy blocks in specific
          chakras affect the death process and why it is important to clear
          energy blocks like fear, anger, or guilt during life if possible. She
          explores the grieving process and offers helpful strategies for moving
          through it as well as “at-a-glance” reference tables of the nine
          stages and related healing strategies designed to be referred to by
          those holding vigil. <br /><br />Shedding light on one of the great
          mysteries of existence, <i>An Energy Healer’s Book of Dying</i> offers
          a compact yet comforting guide to support you through this emotional,
          grief-filled, and exhausting time and help you bring solace to your
          loved one during the transition back to spirit.

          "In this book, Suzanne Worthley helps us to understand not just from a
          physical perspective but from a spiritual/energetic perspective just
          what an amazing journey the dying go through as the soul leaves form
          and travels home. Suzanne writes with the passion of one who has
          first-hand experience of having watched with the dying. I hear the
          truth in her words regarding unfinished business, 'As a soul, we will
          still need to do the work whether we are on this side of the veil or
          not.' This encourages us to integrate our shadows here and now whilst
          still embodied. She further comforts us with the words, 'We are all
          born from love. We are all made from love. We have the ability to
          return to love.' Thank you, Suzanne, you have served us well in
          sharing your wisdom of death and dying.”
