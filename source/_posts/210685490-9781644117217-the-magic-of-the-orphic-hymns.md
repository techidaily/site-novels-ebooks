          <b>Recaptures the magical vitality of the original Orphic Hymns</b
          ><br /><br />• Presents literary translations of the
          <i>teletai</i> that restore important esoteric details and
          correspondences about the being or deity to which each hymn is
          addressed<br /><br />• Includes messages inscribed on golden leaves
          meant to be passports for the dead as well as a reinvention of a lost
          hymn to Number that preserves the original mystical intent of the
          <i>teletai</i><br /><br />• Explores the obscure origins and the
          evolution of the Orpheus myth, revealing a profound influence on
          countercultures throughout Western history<br /><br />As famous
          Renaissance philosopher Marsilio Ficino wrote, “No magic is more
          powerful than that of the Orphic Hymns.” These legendary teletai of
          Orpheus were not simply “hymns”—they were initiatic poems for
          meditation and ritual, magical, and ceremonial use, each one addressed
          to a specific deity, such as Athena or Zeus, or a virtue, such as
          Love, Justice, and Equality. Yet despite the mystical concepts
          underlying them, the original hymns were formulaic, creating an
          obstacle for translators. <br /><br />Recapturing the magical vitality
          that inspired mystery cults through the ages, Tamra Lucid and Ronnie
          Pontiac present new versions of the <i>teletai</i> that include
          important esoteric details and correspondences about the being or
          deity to which each hymn is addressed. The authors also include a new
          version of a lost hymn called “Number” and messages that were
          inscribed on golden leaves meant to be passports for the dead,
          reinventions that preserve the original magical intent and mysticism
          of the <i>teletai</i>. Revealing the power of the individual hymns to
          attune the reader to the sacred presence of the Orphic Mysteries and
          the higher order of nature, the authors also show how, taken together,
          the Orphic Hymns are a book of hours or a calendar of life, addressing
          every event, from birth to death, and walking us through all the
          experiences of human existence as necessary and holy.

          “Tamra and Ronnie have outdone themselves! This book is the most
          comprehensively intelligent and pleasurably accessible portrait of
          Orphic mythology now available. Their modern translations of the
          Orphic hymns yield fresh fruit from an ancient vine. The culmination
          of their historical and practical research yields a book that
          testifies to the 21st century: this music is magic, and the magic is
          real. Anyone interested in the intersections of music, myth, and magic
          will delight in this work.”
