          What are soul groups? What is the reality of the spirit world? What
          lies at the mysterious realm of life between lives? Do our past lives
          really catch up with us in the present?<br />
          <br />
          <b><i>Past Lives Unveiled</i></b> takes a fresh, new look at past
          lives and reincarnation. It features some highly unusual case studies,
          including two intriguing hypnotic regressions by eminent psychologist,
          author and past life expert Dr Michael Newton. Two sisters were
          regressed independently by Dr Newton and went back to life in a Stone
          Age tribe, details of which have <i>until now</i> been limited to
          members of the Newton Institute.<br />
          The author, Barry Eaton, was regressed by Peter Smith, a past-life
          expert and international president of the Newton Institute. Graphic
          visitations to ancient Greece and also the US at the time of the Civil
          War make absorbing reading.<br />
          <br />
          <b><i>Past Lives Unveiled</i></b> is the third book in the trilogy
          written by Barry Eaton, following <i>Afterlife </i>and
          <i>No Goodbyes</i>.

          "Barry has wide international experience in all areas of the media and
          entertainment industries. He is a well known radio and TV presenter,
          having spent many years with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
          and various commercial radio and TV stations. His profile embraces
          news and sports anchoring, lifestyle shows, current affairs, talk back
          radio and in what feels to him like an earlier incarnation, was even a
          DJ. He currently hosts and produces an internet radio show
          RadioOutThere.com which has a worldwide audience. He is also a voice
          over artist narrating documentary films, radio and TV commercials, and
          more. As part of a busy schedule he has now joined the Journalist
          Panel for Spokesperson Media Training and will be helping business
          people to understand and work with the media to expand their profile.
          Early in 2006 he co-hosted the spectacular ANZAC Military Tattoo at
          Sydney’s Superdome (now Acer Arena) followed by The Tattoo Spectacular
          in Perth in 2007. Barry originally trained as an actor and returned to
          the stage in Agatha Christie’s play “The Hollow” in Sydney in 2006. He
          has also appeared in a number of films and TV shows. As Co-ordinator
          of the Faculty of Journalism at Macleay College in Sydney, he lectured
          in radio journalism and production from 1995-99. He has also has wide
          corporate experience, running his own company, which embraced media
          consulting, video and audio production and special event marketing and
          publicity. He now consults to Spokesperson Media Training as a
          corporate trainer. Barry branched out from his broadcasting and
          production work to study astrology in 1991, which lead to an ongoing
          exploration of the mysteries of life and what lies beyond. Since then
          he has also developed his abilities as a psychic intuitive and a
          medium, which ultimately led to the writing of “Afterlife”. As a
          writer he has been published widely and has also scripted documentary
          films, commercials and corporate presentations. He also co-wrote the
