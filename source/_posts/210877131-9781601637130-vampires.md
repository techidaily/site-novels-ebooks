            >A guide to the origins and legends of undead mythological monsters
            from around the world.</b
          ><br /><br />“Vampire!” The very word conjures up visions of ruined
          castles, of enigmatic, pale-skinned noblemen shrouded in dark cloaks,
          of slumbering beauties being bloodily ravished by supernatural,
          nocturnal creatures. But just how accurate is that picture? How much
          do we really know about these mysterious entities? Surprisingly,
          perhaps, almost every culture can boast of its own vampire beings, few
          of which correspond to the stock Hollywood image—some are not even
          human in form, some do not drink blood, some appear in daylight. Are
          you ready for such horrors as the Penangal, the screaming blood-soaked
          lead that drifts through the Malayan jungle seeking victims; the
          Jaracacca, the Brazilian stalker that hides in the clothes of its
          victims to drink their blood or bodily fluids; or the Aswang, the
          scaly demon of the Philippines, who lies among the leafy roofs of huts
          and drinks through its tongue? And how do we dispose of vampires? Is
          the simple stake through the heart—much beloved of Hollywood
          directors—really enough, or is there something more? And does the
          sight of the crucifix repel all vampires—what if the vampire is Jewish
          (a dibbyuk)? <i>Vampires</i> is a unique, lavishly illustrated work
          that explores the rich diversity of vampire belief and lore, ranging
          from countries as diverse as Japan, Sweden, and Ireland, looking at
          their historical origins, and setting them in their cultural context.
