            influence of this beloved Celtic goddess, with contributions from

          This anthology celebrates Brigid, an ancient and mysterious Celtic
          spirit who ranks among today’s most popular modern goddesses.
          Venerated in many forms including as a saint and a goddess, Brigid has
          traveled the globe alongside the Celtic diaspora. Once a goddess with
          a narrow territory, she is now an internationally beloved presence.
          While acknowledging her origins, this book also explores Brigid from
          the perspective of those outside her original Celtic homeland.<br /><br />
          Editors Cairelle Crow and Laura Louella have gathered art, poetry,
          stories, spells, rituals, recipes, and traditions as an homage to the
          worldwide influence of Brigid’s magic and lore, especially among the
          descendants of immigrants to the Americas. In compiling these
          individual works, Cairelle and Laura have given voice to those
          traveling ancestors by showcasing a rich and beautiful heritage
          manifested through embodiments of devotion by their descendants, as
          well as others touched by Brigid.
