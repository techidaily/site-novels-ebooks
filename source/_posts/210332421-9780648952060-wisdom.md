            Book 7 of 9 books from the '<strong>GOD Today' Series</strong> by
            author Bryan Foster -
            <strong>Wisdom - GOD's Hints and Tips (2021)</strong>. A collection
            of Revelations, Inspired Messages and Key/Vital input from GOD to
            the author.
            <strong
              >Over 200 quotes are presented for serious reflection over time as
              these come from GOD in various ways and often continuously. </strong
            >The
            <strong
              >21 Revelations from GOD to Bryan in 2016 (15) and 2018 (6), along
              with the major Revelation in 1982</strong
            >
            when Bryan received GOD in a special way as part of the
            <strong
              >laying on of hands healing from the secondary school's principal,
              Sr Ann. An incredible warmth from GOD moved from his head to feet.
              This occurred on the school's 'Commitment to God' day</strong
            >. This day was also the author's 25th birthday; along with the day
            he left this school for his first principalship of a primary school
            in the country. Bryan, Karen, his wife, and newly born first
            daughter moved to Tara and two years later to Goondiwindi as
            principal in both schools.

          <p>The Wisdom quotes in this Book 7 come from three main sources:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Each quote has come from GOD and through Bryan, the author, to
              our worldly populations. </strong
            >This book Series is presently Bryan's best way to promulgate GOD's
            Revelations and Messages. The Revelations from 2016 and 2018 were
            'spoken' to Bryan from GOD in the early morning
          </p>
          <p>
            around 3am each time from GOD while the author was camping in a
            caravan/trailer on the plains of Mt Warning, NSW, Australia.

              and with great care.</strong

          </p>
          <p>
            The author has sent copies of the published books to a number of
            church/religious leaders worldwide.
