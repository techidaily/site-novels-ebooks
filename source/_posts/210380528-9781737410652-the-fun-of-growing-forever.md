          <p>
            We all seek meaning in our lives, especially as we move past the
            grubbing for money and status of our early years. And even those who
            find earthly success soon discover that there is no end to those
            struggles, no top to be found, no rat-race prize, so every
            thoughtful person eventually sees that whatever success we might
            find on earth gives us nothing more than toys whose luster is going
            to dim as our bodies fail. No matter how rich and famous we become,
            we realize in the end that we have never owned anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only thing that you and I can own is the powers of our eternal
            minds, so achieving spiritual growth while on earth is the best way
            to add to our permanent wealth. Achieving spiritual growth turns out
            to be the whole secret to human happiness.<strong></strong>This is
            true for all of us, whether rich or poor and no matter how much fun
            we might seem to be having. Since we have not known why we were
            here, we have been seeking happiness in all the wrong places; but
            thanks to insights lately received from people we used to think were
            dead, our floundering is about to end. And what we are learning now
            about the spiritual growth that is our core human need is
            remarkable:
          </p>
          <p>
            ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing spiritually has
            nothing to do with religions. In fact, as you will see, religious
            practices can impede or even prevent spiritual growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong
              >Growing spiritually is amazingly easy! </strong
            >You can make it a part of your daily life without much affecting
            your routines, and almost from the start it feels delicious. It
            doesn't take long to make lots of progress, so it never is too late
            to begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing spiritually makes
            you happier.<strong></strong>Whatever else may be going on in your
            life, elevating your personal spiritual energy makes coping easier.
            It makes everything look brighter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing spiritually can bring you a much better afterlife
            experience.<strong></strong>The heavens that we enter at death turn
            out to be a spiritual hierarchy in which those who are more
            developed spiritually will have much richer eternal lives. Since you
            are here and living this earth-life anyway, why not use whatever
            time you have left to make your eternal life more wonderful?
