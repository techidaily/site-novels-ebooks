          Scher, bestselling author of bestselling author of
          <i>How To Heal Yourself From Anxiety When No One Else Can </i>and two
          other books<br /><br />"Kris Ferraro's new book, Energy Healing is a
          true gift! She leads the reader through an understanding of what
          energy is, how it works in the body, and how to heal a myriad of
          issues in your life with simple, easy to follow practices. Hers is a
          voice of compassion, encouragement, joy and wonder. I can't think of a
          better guide through this field. The book is full of wonderful and
          simple ways to get your energy working for you, and why it matters.
          You couldn't find a better way to start or deepen your understanding
          of energy than to pick up this book." —Lauren Walker, International

            The Energy Medicine Yoga Prescription.</i
          ><br /><br /><br />"We are in an era where people are taking more
          control of their health and decisions about recovery and healing.
          Never has it been easier to access knowledge and information, and of
          course evidence. Kris’ book offers a practical guide to a growing area
          in complementary approaches and provides actual tools you can start
          using right now. There is a 4th wave of therapy approaches emerging
          and they are body based – this book outlines how these methods can be
          used to reduce, relieve and address stress in the body and let’s be
          honest: most people are looking for that. Enjoy the read and the
          application—this is undoubtedly the future of the therapy space."<br /><br />—Dr.

          complicated and makes it not only accessible, but fun to practice (and
          the book is full of practices...you will find at least one that works
          for you). She approaches her subject with professionalism, empathy,

          >"Boom! This one rocks. <i>Energy Healing</i> is completely
          satisfying. It’s at once an easy to understand How-To, and a very
          personal and relatable story most everyone can resonate with, about
          how most of us eventually come to energy work. Not by any means least,
          this book is like a warm, funny, conversation with a friend who’s
          sharing something cool and helpful. Kris Ferraro’s signature style is
          intrinsically like that—in this first (of many I am sure) works that
          speak to the human condition, she finds organic ways to make us smile
          in self-reflection, understand we’re not alone, and like a flashlight
          of saving grace, point the way through the dark times. You are
          guaranteed to enjoy this book, and even if you’re a seasoned energy
          fan, you’ll find several things you didn’t know. This is the whole
          package for beginning to understand what energy healing, medicine and
          psychology are all about, and how to start using them for yourself.
          Brava!" —Jondi Whitis, MTOT<br /><br />"What a treat this book is!
          After providing the reader with a thorough yet practical introduction
          to the basics of Energy Healing, Kris then takes us on a journey of
          the benefits of putting this information to use. She lays out easy,
          step-by-step methods to practice a variety of energy-optimizing tools,
          providing options for customizing to suit individual needs. Kris’s
          book provides a much-needed resource to shed light on these practices.
          She even puts it all together to give a great example of how to
          incorporate the techniques into daily life. Read this book and begin
          your Energy Healing journey today." <br />– Terry Maluk, author of

          >.<br /><br />"Kris Ferraro has given us a most helpful book for those
          interested in learning about energy healing. She presents the theory
          and practices in a way that new comers to the field can easily benefit
          for it is one of the most comprehensive and easy to use guides for
          beginners I have seen. I highly recommend it."<br />—Henry Grayson,
          Ph.D., author of <i>Your Power to Heal<br /><br /></i>"I wish I had
          this book when I was struggling to make sense of this world as a
          highly sensitive twenty three year old and my life was an unmanageable
          hot mess! Kris takes concepts that took me years to master and makes
          them readily accessible. She breaks everything down with clear,
          concise explanations and then offers simple DOABLE actions so anyone
          with a few minutes of time and willingness to experiment can try them.
          <br />Even after more than three decades exploring many forms of
          energy healing, I still found valuable gems on nearly every page. Kris
          breathes new life into some of my go-to techniques providing a fresh
          perspective for this seasoned professional. Whether you are just
          considering this book as a possible next step on your path, or are an
          experienced practitioner, Energy Healing will be a must have resource
          guide for your library. <br />Don’t be fooled by the brevity of this
          volume. Kris delivers information with a precision that distills each
          topic and tool to its purest form. I have no doubt my copy will become
          a dog-eared favorite and a frequent gift for my clients and loved
          ones."<br />—Jennifer Elizabeth Moore EFT Master Trainer &amp; Author

        </h4>
        <p>
          Kris Ferraro is an International Energy Coach, Teacher, and sought
          after Inspirational Speaker. Leaving a lengthy and successful career
          in social services to guide others in the energy practices she had
          used to heal herself, Kris empowers others through the profound
          promise in energy healing. She frequently speaks to diverse groups on
          how purpose, love, faith, and balanced energy are the ancient
          antidotes to modern stress caused by our current climate of constant
          uncertainty. A lifelong learner in the areas of personal growth,
          healing, and religious/spiritual history and education, Kris applies
          this knowledge in her own life, teachings, writings, and her
          professional coaching practice. Having spent dozens of years studying
          Shamanism, mysticism, Jungian philosophy, New Thought, and Shadow
          work, along with a serious study in all things energy, Kris found the
          common threads woven throughout. She is the creator of Spiritual
          Freedom Techniques, a series of processes that combine spiritual
          practices and principles with energy balancing for super charged
          transformation. A former punk rocker, radio DJ, and performance
          artist, it was in healing her severe social anxiety that she was
          finally able to uncover her purpose and truly shine, without panic. In
          addition to writing and creating curriculum on healing, and producing
          a cutting-edge newsletter with original photography, she writes and
          performs spoken word poetry and is an accomplished sculptor. When not
          traveling, she lives in Montclair, NJ, with her cats Ling and The Baby
          Cheetah. <i>Energy Healing</i> is her first book.
