          Morgan will have you laughing, soul-searching and stretching to think
          beyond your self-imposed limits. Her bold, fresh thinking and personal
          experiences give women who have the "Superwoman personality" the tools
          to truly have it all.Denise Stillman, MBA, Owner, "Field of Dreams"
          Movie Site; Author, Courageous Clarity: Four Keys to Unlock the Leader
          InsideMorgan Field is poised to become one of the self-development
          leaders of our time. She has the ability to cut to the core of an
          issue and express love and compassion when delivering harsh truths.
          Her understanding of the world beyond the physical and her insistence
          on walking her talk make her a strong leader especially equipped to
          help women find their way back to their true path.Avril Marchegiano,
          Holistic Therapy Practitioner for Animals, www.AvrilTheIndigo.comEpic
          Sexy You is for every woman who has struggled with identifying healthy
          relationships and for every young girl who desires to become a strong
          independent woman. This book will shift a woman's positioning in her
          own life, moving her from passenger-seat rider to Indy car
          driver.Courtney Lynne Butler, Women's Empowerment Coach, Owner of
          Transform Her LLC, www.courtneybutler.comHell YES! This book is NOT
          your typical self-help cheerleader crap. Morgan is massively positive
          but she's also the real deal. She shares her journey in ways that
          stopped me in my tracks. I will never look at my own indecisiveness
          and tolerance of bad behavior in the same way. Officially a
          "must-read" for all my clients!Shawna Burkhart, Executive Life Coach
          and Psychotherapist, The Honest Edge, www.thehonestedge.comI have
          always told my clients that "selfish" is not a bad word. Morgan takes
          that concept and explodes it with wit, inspiration and an authentic,
          can-do spirit that will cause you to stand up and shout, "Why me? Why
          the hell not me?"Julie Bauke, Chief Career Happiness Officer, The
          Bauke Group, www.thebaukegroup.comWhen I went on a retreat with Morgan
          to Costa Rica, she introduced me to some of the life-changing tools
          she reveals in this book. I began to implement them into my life, and
          I am blown away by how much my life has already changed. I am
          healthier and happier. A simple shift of unapologetically taking
          charge in all aspects of my life has led me down the path of achieving
          things that I didn't even think were possible.Ana Dominguez, Creator
          and Editor, "The City Sidewalks," www.thecitysidewalks.comMorgan
          writes as she speaks, with honesty, integrity, and from her soul. She
          shows you how to break the negative patterns for good by providing
          examples from her own journey and using simple, easy-to-understand,
          yet direct language. If you do the work the results truly are epic and
          instant.Elaine Batho, Health, Fitness and Healing for Your Body, Mind,
          and Soul, www.healingfitandwellness.comYou there, yes you, on the
          couch: Whether you are in a rut, a living zombie, or simply ready to
          challenge yourself, read this book. I know I always wanted better for
          myself. It wasn't until the universe decided to bless me with Morgan
          that I felt certain I would live it.Leecis Perry, Founder of
          leecisllc, Exceptional Facial and Waxing Services and Original Epic
          Sexy Goddess tribe member.
