            >A friendly guide to a wide array of divination tools, both ancient
            and modern, from internationally known spiritual teacher and author
            Radleigh Valentine.</b
          ><br /><br />With a little help from the angels and a dash of fairy
          dust, <b>Radleigh Valentine</b> invites you to find your perfect
          "language" for communicating with the Universe to manifest your most
          cherished dreams! This simple how-to guide explores different
          divination tools, also known as oracles, which are simply methods of
          getting clarity and assistance from Source. You'll learn the basics of
          working with the magic of angels, fairies, tarot and oracle cards,
          Lenormand, runes, pendulums, the I Ching, astrology, numerology,
          meditation, and mantras--all delivered with Radleigh's gentle sense of
          humor and deft way of making complicated topics easy to understand.<br /><br />With
          each turn of a card, swing of a pendulum, or chanted mantra, your eyes
          will be opened to the brightness and the vastness of the Universe.
          Release your fears and see again through the universal language of
          laughter that . . . life really is magic!
