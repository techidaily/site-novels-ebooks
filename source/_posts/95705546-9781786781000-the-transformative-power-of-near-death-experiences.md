            >An “enthralling” study of the far-reaching positive effects of
            Near-Death Experiences—a “well-written and thought-provoking book”
            (Anita Moorjani, author of <i>Dying to Be Me</i>)</b
          ><br /><br />
          Near-death experiences (NDEs) are often transformative—not only on an
          individual level, but on a collective level too. This book contains a
          selection of inspiring stories from ordinary people whose
          extraordinary experiences have changed the course and direction of
          their lives, opening each and every one of them to the power of divine
          love.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          Recent years have seen a dramatic change of attitude towards NDEs.
          Unfortunately, the ongoing debates about NDEs have detracted greatly
          from their transformational effects and how empowering they can be for
          the whole of mankind. For those who experience them, NDEs often
          instill the knowledge that we are all interconnected and part of one
          great whole.<br /><br />
          This book aims to inspire people from all walks of life, creeds,
          cultures, and faiths to the transformational power of the message of
          NDEs—and to show how the love experienced during the NDE has the
          capacity to heal minds, bodies and souls.

          “Extraordinary transformation results from NDEs in the lives of the
          experiencers themselves, and this book explores many such
          life-changing stories in a most revealing fashion. One of its greatest
          gifts is its comforting portrayal of the infinite healing power of
          love, and the sense of connectedness with the universe that arises
          from such profound experiences. Science is on the cusp of a major
          awakening as NDEs and similar spiritually transformative experiences
          demand more complete explanations, all opening the door to a more
          meaningful understanding of the nature of consciousness, and of all of
          existence.”<br />

          <b><i>Proof of Heaven</i> and <i>The Map of Heaven</i></b
          ><i><br /><br /> </i>“The book can do more to release humanity from
          its fear of dying than any book in recent memory.”<i><br /> </i
          ><b>—Neale Donald Walsch, international bestselling author<br /> </b
          ><br />
          “An enthralling read that encapsulates the positive impact Near Death
          experiences are having on people and the wider world. The work done by
          Penny Sartori and Kelly Walsh truly reinforces the important message
          that we are all one, all connected, and that love is the most powerful
          source in the universe capable of healing the world.&nbsp; I highly
          recommend this well written and thought-provoking book. Not only are
          part of the proceeds earned from the book being used to make a
          difference in children’s lives, this book has the power within its
          pages to open the hearts minds and souls of every person that reads
          it.<br />
