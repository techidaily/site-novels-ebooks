            >Supported by Mayan traditions, this book shows you how to embrace
            gratitude in every area of your life so that you may find ultimate
            bliss, happiness, and connection to all things.</b
          ><br /><br />In <i>Remember Your Roots,</i> Mayan Spiritual Guide
          Christine Olivia Hernandez draws upon her lineage’s wisdom and
          cosmovision. She bridges these ancient teachings to the modern day so
          you can connect to your roots and live with greater wholeness,
          regardless of your specific ancestry. However, there is a problem.
          Many people do not feel connected to their roots, but rather, a sense
          of loss, mistrust, and unsafety in the world.<br /><br />By speaking
          to the core issues we all face, Christine guides you through an
          intentional 13 chapter journey to help you access gratitude in every
          area of your life. Gratitude is a state of being that brings health,
          abundance, and enlightenment, for it’s the key that unlocks all doors
          in your life. When we remember this truth, we find that we are
          connected to the wisdom of the trees, the light of stars, the
          elements, and to each other. Realizing this, we can overcome any
          adversity.<br /><br />From accessing the wisdom of your body and
          creating a positive mental environment, to resolving unhealthy
          generational patterns and embracing the importance of ceremony and
          celebration, this book guides you to feel wholeness and gratitude in
          every area of your life.

          “<i>Remember Your Roots</i> is an incredible book that makes timeless
          Indigenous wisdom accessible to the descendants of any lineage so they
          can awaken their inner ancestral knowledge and be guided back home to
          their highest selves.”<br />
          —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sahara Rose, bestselling author and host of
          Highest Self Podcast<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>“Remember Your Roots</i> is a profound exploration of our
          collective lineage, intricately woven with the ancient wisdom of the
          Mayan people. The power of this book lies in its ability to transcend
          the boundaries of time and culture. It's not just about understanding
          Mayan wisdom; it’s about rekindling a relationship with our own primal
          heritage, a journey toward wholeness in a fragmented world. This book
          is an essential read for anyone seeking to understand the
          interconnectedness of all life and the importance of honoring our past
          to navigate our future. <i>Remember Your Roots</i> is indeed a
          testament to the enduring power of Indigenous wisdom in shaping our
          collective consciousness.”<br />
          —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ana Flores, founder of
          <i>We All Grow Latina</i> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This brilliant book is a divine offering of pure love and deep
          ancestral wisdom. It’s a generous gift to the world and one that
          blends ancient Indigenous wisdom with our modern times. The Mayan
          teachings shared throughout awaken all that is waiting to be reclaimed
          and remembered. <i>Remember Your Roots</i> invites us to heal in a way
          that our bones and blood remember—a potent journey indeed.”<br />
          —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asha Frost, Indigenous Medicine Woman and
          author of <i>You are the Medicine</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Remember Your Roots</i> is an invitation to go to the depth. This
          book reminds you that you are more powerful than you know, and wiser
          than you give yourself credit for. It’s a must read for those ready to
          transform from the roots up.”<br />
          —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Christine Gutiérrez, Latina therapist and
          author of <i>I Am Diosa </i>and <i>Wisdom del Alma</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The ancestral Maya honored their elders and had a cosmovision that
          surrounded them with many powerful gods that inhabited the sky, the
          jungle, and the underworld of caves. Christine, in Remember Your
          Roots, manages to connect her maya roots and our modern world with her
          personal relationship with the divine developed in a narrative of life
          as a medicine woman and guide for her peers.”<br />
          —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fernando Paiz Andrade, President of La Ruta
          Maya Conservation Foundation
