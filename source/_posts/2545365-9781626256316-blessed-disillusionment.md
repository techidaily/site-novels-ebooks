          “Morgan Caraway's book is an excellent summary and presentation of the
          fundamentals of the non-dual perspective. It is one of the most direct
          and uncompromising contemporary books on non-duality I have seen.
          Morgan's insights are dead on target and he does not pull any punches.
          If you are looking for a ‘politically correct’ expression of
          non-duality this is likely NOT the book for you. It is full of sharp,
          clear and witty expressions that will delight the discerning reader
          interested in cutting the through the fog of fuzzy spiritual concepts
          and half truths that often pass for clarity. Morgan expresses the
          universal and timeless themes of non-duality in an original, fresh
          way. This book is not a retread of worn-out spiritual concepts;
          rather, it is a bold and radical wake-up call that dares you to
          recognize your original nature as it is here and now.”<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Morgan Carraway</b> was born and grew up in the oldest city in the
          United States—St. Augustine, FL. He was an only child and entertained
          himself by drawing and taking flights of fancy into the worlds of
          science fiction and fantasy. In his teens, he started having a
          mid-youth crisis and began seeking a way out of the sense of
          separation. This led him through forays into many different belief
          systems, none of which brought the lasting peace that was sought. In
          his early thirties, he was exposed to the concept of non-duality but
          searching seemingly went on for several more years. While reading
          <i>The Light Behind Consciousness</i> by John Wheeler, he spoke to
          John and many of the concepts that plagued him were revealed were
          revealed to be nothing more than hollow ideas. The thought-based
          belief in limitation was seen to be a temporary appearance arising
          within eternal and timeless presence. Seeking ended and life in all of
          its beauty and seeming imperfection was seen to be the perfect
          expression of undivided being. At least this is how the story goes...
