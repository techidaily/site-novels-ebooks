              >One of the greatest spiritual leaders of the twentieth century
              encourages us to embrace the qualities of life our advancing years
              grant us in
              <i>Maturity: The Responsibility of Being Oneself</i>.</b
            ><br /><br />In a culture infatuated with youth and determined to
            avoid old age at all costs, this book dares to raise a question that
            has been all but forgotten in the age of Viagra and cosmetic
            surgery. What benefits might lie in accepting the aging process as
            natural, rather than trying to hold on to youth and its pleasures
            all the way to the grave?<br /><br />Osho takes us back to the roots
            of what it means to grow up rather than just to grow old. Both in
            our relationships with others, and in the fulfillment of our own
            individual destinies, he reminds us of the pleasures that only true
            maturity can bring. He outlines the ten major growth cycles in human
            life, from the self-centered universe of the preschooler to the
            flowering of wisdom and compassion in old age.<br /><br />Osho’s sly
            sense of humor runs like a red thread through the book, along with a
            profound compassion and understanding of how easy it is to be
            distracted from the deeper meaning and purpose of our lives—which
            is, ultimately, to flower into our own individual uniqueness and
            maturity with an attitude of celebration and joy.<br /><br /><b
              >Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the
              conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their
              capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described
              by the <i>Sunday Times</i> of London as one of the “1000 Makers of
              the 20th Century” and by <i>Sunday Mid-Day </i>(India) as one of
              the ten people—along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha—who have
              changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the
              influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers
              of all ages in virtually every country of the world.</b

          tips on maturity as the path to wisdom, the art of transcending
          problems rather than having to solve them, and the secret of
          transforming a midlife crisis into a creative explosion.” —<i
