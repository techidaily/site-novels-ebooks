            Deepak Chopra’s books to date. Want the answers to the secrets of
            life? Let me recommend that you start right here." —Ken Wilber,
            author of </b
          ><i><b>A Brief History of Everything</b><br /><br /></i>We all want to
          know how to find a soul mate, what career would be most fulfilling,
          how to live a life with meaning, and how to teach our children well.
          We are looking for a personal breakthrough, a turning point, a
          revelation that brings with it new meaning.&nbsp;<i
            >The Book of Secrets</i
          >—a crystalline distillation of insights and wisdom accumulated over
          the lifetime of one of the great spiritual thinkers of our
          time—provides an exquisite new tool for achieving just that.<br /><br />Every
          life is a book of secrets, ready to be opened. The secret of perfect
          love is found there, along with the secrets of healing, compassion,
          faith, and the most elusive one of all: who we really are. We are
          still mysteries to ourselves, despite the proximity of these answers,
          and what we most long to know remains lodged deep inside.
          <br /><br />Because answers to the questions at the center of life are
          counterintuitive, they are often hidden from view, sequestered from
          our everyday gaze. In his ongoing quest to elevate our experience,
          bestselling author Deepak Chopra has isolated fifteen secrets that
          drive the narrative of this inspiring book—and of our lives. From "The
          World Is in You" and "What You Seek, You Already Are" to "Evil Is Not
          Your Enemy" and "You Are Truly Free When You Are Not a Person,"<i>
            The Book of Secrets</i
          >
          is rich with insights. It is a priceless treasure that can transport
          us beyond change to transformation, and from there to a sacred place
          where we can savor the nectar of enlightenment.
