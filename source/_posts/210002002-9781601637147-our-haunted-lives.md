            >We are not alone…A collection of personal interviews with those who
            have witnessed the supernatural firsthand.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          When people encounter what they perceive to be a ghost or spirit,
          their lives are forever changed. The ultimate question—Is there life
          after death—has just been answered for them.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Ghosts cross every culture and continent, and the belief in their
          existence is on the rise. <i>Our Haunted Lives</i> features the
          stories of dozens of people who have witnessed the supernatural
          firsthand in their homes, at work, and in numerous other locations,
          and explores the profound nature of ghosts and spirits. Through
          personal interviews, the author captures the many different facets of
          the experience: the touching, where people come in contact with a
          loved one who’s passed on; the funny, where pranks are played or
          peculiar disembodied sounds are heard; and the frightening, where
          people still feel shaken by what they saw, heard, and felt.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Ghosts are unbiased—they appear to people from all walks of life,
          ages, cultures, and religious backgrounds.
          <i>Our Haunted Lives</i> features accounts from famous hauntings, such
          as an extensive interview with George Lutz, the man whose experiences
          with the paranormal in Amityville, Long Island, launched debates,
          books, and movies. You’ll hear from police officers who were the first
          on the scene after a homeowner reported a break-in, only to find the
          disturbance wasn’t caused by the living, and doctors who had a brush
          with the supernatural after losing a patient on the operating table
          and speak about the very emotional and profound events they witnessed.
          Indeed, we are not alone.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Jeff Belanger leads a very haunted life. He's been fascinated with the
          supernatural since age 10, when he investigated his first haunted
          house during a sleepover. Since then, he's been a writer and
          journalist for various newspapers and magazines, and in 1999 he
          launched Ghostvillage.com as a repository for his writings on the
          subject of the supernatural. The Website has since grown to become the
          largest paranormal community on the Web, attracting hundreds of
          thousands of visitors per year. He currently haunts Bellingham,
          Massachusetts, with his wife, Megan.
