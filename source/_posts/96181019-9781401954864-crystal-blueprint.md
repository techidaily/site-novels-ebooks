            >A guide to quartz crystals from both an ancestral and scientific
            point of view, with the mission of helping readers identify their
            mind patterns and wounds to reconnect with the authentic self.</b
          ><br /><br />It's estimated that 10 billion quartz crystals are used
          every year in electronic devices--from smartphones to computers,
          credit cards, watches, digital cameras, TVs, cars, and much more. When
          you think about it, it's almost impossible to imagine life without
          crystals.<br />These same crystals we see in so much of our technology
          have been used over the course of many centuries, and by many
          different cultures around the world, for healing. In fact, crystal
          healing is alive and well today, with modern-day healers harnessing
          the energy of quartz crystals to help alleviate suffering. <br />What
          is it that has drawn scientists and healers around the world to
          crystal technology, and what are the similarities between the ways
          these two groups have used the stones? <br />In this book, crystal
          healer and holistic therapist Beatriz Singer answers these
          questions--and more. She takes readers on a journey to understand the
          many wonders of quartz crystals, so that we can use their powers to
          bring peace and healing to ourselves and the world.

          “There are dozens of books about the use of crystals for healing and
          personal exploration. Beatriz Singer’s&nbsp;<i
            >The Crystal Blueprint&nbsp;</i
          >is unique because it dives deep into the history, folklore, science,
          and speculation about why crystals have fascinated us for millennia.
          For a broad-ranging survey about one particular type of crystal
          (quartz), and what it might do for you, this is the book to get.”<br /><b

          an excellent addition to the field of crystallography, the study and
          knowledge of crystals. As an investigative journalist, Singer utilizes
          superb research abilities to fully describe what crystals are, their
          uses in modern tech-nological and healing modalities, and the profound
          practices of crystals by ancient priesthoods and shamans.
          Incorporating her own personal journey with crystal healing and those
          of her clients, Singer provides a comprehensive understanding of the
          subject. Having researched crystals in general—and crystal skulls in
          particular—myself for over 40 years, I highly recommend this book as a
          valuable addition to the library of a true seeker.”<br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Beatriz Singer, a native of Venezuela, knows firsthand the power of
          crystals to alleviate real-world suffering, as 25 years ago she
          embarked on a journey to heal herself from cancer and a painful
          divorce. In 2000, she was initiated into the ancient art of crystal
          healing by Hindu masters in India. Soon after, Beatriz became a
          pioneer of crystal healing and the founder-director of one of the
          first interfaith, alternative therapy centers in Colombia. Today she
          continues to lead crystal workshops in person and online and to offer
          individual assessments and guided self-healing. Beatriz's unique
          approach is also informed by her 26 years of experience as a
          university-trained professional journalist. She offers a combination
          of sensitivity, intuition, and personal experience along with
          journalistic skills of observation, questioning and research to better
          help her clients in their quest to heal and transform their lives.
