            >The cutting edge of neurolinguistics meets the spiritual wisdom of
            the ages in a handbook of key words that literally rewire our
            brains.</b
          ><br /><br />New discoveries in biology and the neurosciences are
          revealing how the structure of language-the words we think and
          speak-can actually change the way the neurons in our brains and hearts
          connect. But our ancestors understood this connection intuitively,
          thousands of years ago. They created specific word-patterns to provide
          comfort, healing, strength, and inner power in difficult times, and
          they encoded these powerful words in prayers, chants, mantras, hymns,
          and sacred writings to preserve them for future generations. Now
          beloved teacher and thought leader Gregg Braden cracks the code and
          puts these powerful words in your hands.<br /><br />Perfect as a
          pocket guide, a reference for spiritual study, or a gift to someone
          you love, this elegant, compact book contains Wisdom Codes that cut to
          the core of life's greatest tests, most challenging demands, and
          hardest lessons. You'll find chapters devoted to healing from loss and
          grief, facing your unspoken fears, finding certainty in the face of
          uncertain choices, and finding forgiveness, as well as ancient
          parables that offer a "fast track" to unraveling life's deepest
          mysteries. <br /><br />Each Wisdom Code-distilled from a quote, a
          scripture passage, or a parable-is accompanied by a brief discussion
          of what the code means, why it's important, and how to apply it in
          your life.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Gregg Braden</b> is a five-time New York Times best-selling author,
          researcher, educator, lecturer and internationally renowned as a
          pioneer bridging science, spirituality, and human potential.<br /><br />
          From 1979 to 1991 Gregg worked as a problem solver during times of
          crisis for Fortune 500 companies, including Cisco Systems where he
          became the first Technical Operations Manager in 1991. He continues
          problem-solving today as he merges modern science and the wisdom of
          our past to reveal real-world solutions to the issues that challenge
          our lives. His research has led to 15 film credits and 12
          award-winning books now published in over 40 languages.<br /><br />
          Gregg is a member of the American Association for the Advancement of
          Science (AAAS) and is active with visionary organizations including
          the HeartMath Global Coherence Initiative and The Arlington Institute.
          He has presented his discoveries in over 30 countries on six
          continents and has been invited to speak to The United Nations,
          Fortune 500 companies and the U. S. military.<br /><br />
          The United Kingdom’s Watkins Journal lists Gregg among the top 100 of
          “the world’s most spiritually influential living people” for the 7th
          consecutive year, and he is a 2020 nominee for the prestigious
          Templeton Award, established to honor “outstanding individuals who
          have devoted their talents to expanding our vision of human purpose
          and ultimate reality.”
