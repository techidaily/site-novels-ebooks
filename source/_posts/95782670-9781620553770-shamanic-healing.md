          A story-based guide to the techniques of shamanic healing<br /><br />•
          Details indigenous medicine tools and soul healing techniques,
          including diagnosis and energy cleansing with plants, stones, fire,
          flower essences, and sound<br /><br />• Offers protection and
          self-defense techniques for confronting negative energies such as
          spirit attachment and possession<br /><br />• Shares healing stories
          that each address a specific condition, such as panic attacks, PTSD,
          depression, cancer, chronic pain, grief, and relationship problems<br /><br />Shamanic
          healing is making an astonishing comeback all over the modern
          technology-driven and consumerist world. Millions of people have felt
          called to integrate both ancient and modern healing systems into a new
          model of healthcare. But what makes shamanic healing so powerful? Why
          have indigenous healers kept it alive for thousands of years?<br /><br />Revealing
          his personal journey and stories from his more than 20 years as a
          shamanic healer, Itzhak Beery explains who a shaman is and how he or
          she works, demystifying and destigmatizing the shamanic healing
          worldview. He shares shamanic wisdom from two of his teachers: a
          Yachak from Ecuador and a well-known Brazilian Pagé. He details
          indigenous medicine tools and soul healing techniques that you can
          practice with your own clients or in your own personal healing,
          including diagnosis and energy cleansing with plants, stones, fire,
          rum, eggs, flower essences, and sound. He shares protection and
          self-defense techniques for confronting negative energies, such as
          spirit attachment and possession. Sharing healing stories that each
          address a specific condition, such as panic attacks, PTSD, depression,
          cancer, chronic pain, grief, and relationship problems, Beery explains
          how a shaman is not responsible for curing everyone and will consult
          with the patient’s soul to determine its needs, which sometimes
          includes learning from the illness experience.<br /><br />By sharing
          these healing methods, Beery reveals the importance of shamanic
          practices in resolving our 21st-century emotional and physical
          problems and their importance to the future of humanity and the
          planet.

          “Itzhak Beery beautifully describes an extraordinary personal journey
          that upends our conventional understanding of medicine and healing.
          Like a scientist on a deep quest he presents the shamanic model for
          healing and how effectively it has worked over the ages. This
          brilliant book expands our possibilities for health and healing. A
          must-read to be prescribed to all seeking healing as well as for their
          health professionals.”
