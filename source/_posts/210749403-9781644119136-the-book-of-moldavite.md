            >A full-color guide to the history, science, and spiritual uses of
            Moldavite</b
          ><br /><br />• Shares the author’s transformational discovery of the
          magic of Moldavite<br /><br />• Looks at Moldavite energy tools, how
          to combine Moldavite with other gemstones, and how to use Moldavite to
          transmit healing energy to people and places<br /><br />• Includes
          powerful Moldavite meditations and hundreds of photos, allowing you to
          attune to Moldavite’s energy without even being in its direct
          presence<br /><br />Created from the cataclysmic impact of a huge
          meteorite, Moldavite is a gemstone that is neither heavenly nor
          earthly but something new that emerged from their union. Classed
          scientifically with tektites, these rare green celestial objects
          showered down over what is now the Czech Republic some 14.8 million
          years ago. In the mid-1980s, a series of synchronicities brought
          Moldavite into the hands of Robert Simmons, and he began sharing its
          powerful effects with the world. <br /><br />In this full-color guide,
          Simmons tells the story of his discovery of Moldavite’s magic, weaving
          his knowledge of the stone’s spiritual qualities together with
          scientific and historical data as well as channeled information. He
          explains how Neolithic peoples in Europe made Moldavite amulets and
          tools and how several Moldavite amulets were discovered in the same
          archaeological dig as the famous Venus of Willendorf, the earliest
          known Goddess figurine. The author describes his dramatic personal
          awakening and the surprising circumstances that brought Moldavite to
          the center of his life and career. He shares tales of crop circles and
          energy vortexes, his adventures in Moldavite country, and ET
          connections. <br /><br />Revealing how the science of Moldavite’s
          origins resonates with ancient mystical legends, the author explores
          Moldavite’s connections with the alchemical Emerald Tablet and the
          fabled Stone of the Holy Grail. He looks at Moldavite energy tools,
          including wands, pendulums, waters, essences, body layouts, and
          crystal grids. He explains how to use Moldavite in photonic layouts to
          transmit energy to people, places, and bodies of water in order to
          heal and revitalize them. He leads the reader through Moldavite
          meditations for expanding awareness, and his wife, Kathy, offers her
          insights into Moldavite’s purpose and power and how we can align with
          it. Throughout the book are hundreds of full-color images of beautiful
          raw pieces, carvings, jewelry, and gems, allowing you to attune to
          Moldavite’s energy without even being in its direct presence.
          <br /><br />Shining a light upon the starborn gem that unites spirit
          and matter, the author shows how Moldavite is—literally and
          figuratively—a joining of Heaven and Earth.
