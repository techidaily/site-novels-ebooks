          <p><i>Ghosts of War</i> is where history and mystery meet.</p>
          <p>
            Phantom U.S. Civil War regiments still march through Harpers Ferry,
            West Virginia, before vanishing into the evening sunset.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beaches of Normandy, France still echo with the cries of the men
            who gave their lives storming the beaches on D-Day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The disembodied clip-clop of horse's hooves and the clank of swords
            from the British Civil War battle of January 25, 1644, are still
            heard in Nantwich, Cheshire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wherever battles were fought and people perished, ghost legends have
            followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ghosts can be found wherever tragedy left its mark. Where men'?s and
            women'?s lives ended so quickly that their spirits may not even
            realize that they're dead. Where soldiers, focused on duty, still
            patrol the front lines of long-finished wars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world's battlefields are imprinted with the passions, fears, and
            horrors of the soldiers who took their enemies? lives and often
            sacrificed their own. Battlefields are still rife with spirit
            activity, centuries after the last cannon was fired and the last
            casualty lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Ghosts of War</i> is a history book told through the eyes of
            witnesses who have experienced the ghosts who still haunt these
            locations. Featuring nearly two dozen battlefields from around the
            world and throughout the centuries, each chapter includes first-hand
            accounts of the battle (where available), important facts and dates,
            historic and ghostly photos of the site, and first-hand ghost
            sightings and supernatural experiences that still occur.
