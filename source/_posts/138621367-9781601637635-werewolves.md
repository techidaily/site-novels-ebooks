          Most of us are familiar with the idea of a werewolf—that someone can
          change, either deliberately or unwillingly, into a ravenous
          creature—but is there some justification for such a belief? And if so,
          how is it achieved—through magical potions or ointments or simply by
          the light of the full moon? Or is the whole thing simply a form of
          delusion, the product of a disturbed mind? In <i>Werewolve</i>s,
          author Dr. Bob Curran examines the deep psychological perceptions
          about the linkage of man with the natural, bestial world. Do the roots
          of such a belief lie in the supernatural world, or are there other
          explanations? How has the discovery of feral children, living in the
          wild, shaped our ideas of human-beasts? And what is the future of such
          beliefs? The book considers genetically-based speculations regarding
          the possible fusion of human and animal genes in order to alleviate
          some human diseases and suffering. Is the idea of man into beast
          really so far fetched? <i>Werewolves</i> is an essential reference
          book which looks, in depth, at a fascinating subject. One word of
          warning though: it must never be read under the baleful rays of a full
          moon. You have been warned!
