            <i>Lessons from the Light</i> offer a new and provocative

          &nbsp;<br />
          We live in a world of near-universal acceptance that once our lives on
          the earth come to an end we continue to a greater world. Whether that
          destination is called "Heaven," "Nirvana," or simply "The Other Side,"
          tradition teaches us that there is, in most cases, a fairy-tale ending
          to life, a place where joy and harmony reigns supreme.&nbsp; Yet, as
          this book attests there is still more to heaven and earth than is
          dreamt of in our philosophies.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          George Anderson is considered by many to be the greatest medium living
          today. After more than 50 years of hearing from souls who have
          transitioned to the world hereafter, he is constantly reminded by
          those who have passed that our preconceived notions of this life—and
          the next—aren’t always accurate. The nine stories in this book
          illuminate times when unusual circumstances such as sudden death,
          unresolved emotions, abusive relationships, and painful family
          dynamics, make it necessary for the dead and the living to find new
          doors to healing.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In session with Anderson, survivors and those who have passed meet
          again in encounters that are profound, bittersweet, highly-emotional
          and sometimes, downright, funny. What we learn is that there are
          little-known spiritual treasures—and lessons to be learned—about
          heaven and earth that can restore, revitalize, and make new what was
          once broken. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>Life Between Heaven and Earth</i> is an inspiring,
          thought-provoking, path-changing work, one that affirms that no matter
          how complicated a circumstance is, resolution, peace and acceptance
          can be found in deep and remarkable ways.

        </h4>
        <p>
          GEORGE ANDERSON is the first medium in history to appear regularly on
          a cable television show, the first medium to gain international
          exposure for his extraordinary ability, and the only medium to be
          cleared by Network Television Standards and Practices to appear on the
          first-ever prime-time special on mediumship,
          <i>Contact: Talking to the Dead</i>. He is the only living medium to
          have been invited to Holland by surviving members of the family of
          Anne Frank, and he remains the most scientifically tested medium on
          earth. Anderson has been featured in newspapers and on television and
          is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>Walking in the Garden of Souls</i> and
          <i>George Anderson's Lessons from the Light</i>.<br /><br />ANDREW
          BARONE is executive director of the George Anderson Grief Support
          Programs and a cofounder of the Foundation of Hope, an organization
          that helps bring the comfort and solace of bereavement programs into
          communities across the United States and around the world. A former
          classical pianist, he has dedicated his skills and life experiences to
          helping others gain a better understanding of matters related to loss
          and dying, and to furthering the acceptance of mediumship as a bona
          fide grief therapy. He is the coauthor of the New York Times
          bestseller <i>Walking in the Garden of Souls </i>and<i>
            George Anderson's Lessons from the Light</i
