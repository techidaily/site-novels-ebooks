          The power to live a pain-free life of health and well-being is stored
          deep in the limitless human mind. <i>Miraculous Health</i> is the
          revolutionary blueprint for accessing this power. Dr. Rick Levy
          systematically guides the reader through a specific program to heal
          physical illness or injury. His sequence of proven prescriptive
          mind-body healing techniques leads to immediate results and miraculous
          changes in long-term vitality. <br />
          <br />
          Dr. Levy's methods are easy to learn and can be customized for
          individual needs. The exercises in this book come with cogent
          explanations of why they work, complete with their scientific
          underpinnings, and are illuminated by true healing stories and
          personal anecdotes. To maximize the power of the work in this book,
          the author provides twelve potent mind-body tools to the reader as
          free audio downloads accessed via the Web. Most important, the reader
          can do this with no more specialized training than a commitment to
          better health. Not just a feel-good theory, and much more than the
          revelation of a phenomenon, <i>Miraculous Health</i> unleashes the
          power within to heal in dramatic and enduring ways.

          "Mind-body medicine is an idea whose time has come.
          <i>Miraculous Health</i> is an excellent guide to this field,
          particularly the use of hypnosis, one of the most misunderstood of
          therapies. No form of medicine which neglects these insights can be
          considered complete." -- Larry Dossey, M.D., author of
          <i>The Extraordinary Healing Power of Ordinary Things</i>
