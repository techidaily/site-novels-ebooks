            “Enlightenment”—is it a myth or is it real? In every spiritual
            tradition, inner explorers have discovered that the liberated state
            is in fact a natural experience, as real as the sensations you are
            having right now—and that through the investigation of your own
            thoughts, feelings, and perceptions you can awaken to clear insight
            and a happiness independent of conditions.<br />&nbsp;<br />For
            decades, one of the most engaging teachers of our time has
            illuminated the many dimensions of awakening—but solely at his live
            retreats and on audio recordings. Now, with
            <i>The Science of Enlightenment</i>, Shinzen Young brings to readers
            an uncommonly lucid guide to mindfulness meditation for the first
            time: how it works and how to use it to enhance your cognitive
            capacities, your kindness and connection with the world, and the
            richness of all your experiences.<br />&nbsp;<br />As thousands of
            his students and listeners will confirm, Shinzen is like no other
            teacher you’ve ever encountered. He merges scientific clarity, a
            rare grasp of source-language teachings East and West, and a gift
            for sparking insight through unexpected analogies, illustrations,
            humor, and firsthand accounts that reveal the inner journey to be as
            wondrous as any geographical expedition. Join him here to
            explore:&nbsp;Universal insights spanning Buddhism, Christian and
            Jewish mysticism, shamanism, the yogas of India, and many other

          <b>Shinzen Young</b><br />Shinzen Young became fascinated with Asian
          culture while a teenager in Los Angeles. Later he enrolled in a PhD
          program in Buddhist Studies at the University of Wisconsin.
          Eventually, he went to Asia and did extensive training in each of the
          three major Buddhist traditions: Vajrayana, Zen and Vipassana. Upon
          returning to the United States, his academic interests shifted to the
          burgeoning dialogue between Eastern meditation and Western science.
          Shinzen is known for his innovative “interactive, algorithmic
          approach” to mindfulness, a system specifically designed for use in
          pain management, recovery support, and as an adjunct to psychotherapy.
          He leads meditation retreats throughout North America and has helped
          establish numerous mindfulness centers and programs. He also consults
          widely on meditation-related research, in both the clinical and the
          basic science domains. He often says: “My life’s passion lies in
          exploring what may arise from the cross-fertilization of the best of
          the East with the best of the West.”
