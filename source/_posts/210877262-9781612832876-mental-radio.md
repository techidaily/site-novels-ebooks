            >The Pulitzer Prize–winning author’s account of testing his wife’s
            telepathic abilities—with a preface by Albert Einstein.</b
          ><br /><br />Upton Sinclair is primarily known as the author of
          <i>The Jungle</i>, <i>Oil</i>, and <i>Dragon’s Teeth</i>, and as a
          fiery advocate of social justice and reform. Few know, however, of
          Sinclair’s deep interest in, and connection to, psychic research.<br /><br />Sinclair’s
          own wife, Mary Craig Kimbrough, claimed to have “mind reading” or
          telepathic abilities, and asked Sinclair to help her better understand
          these abilities. He devised a fascinating series of 300 tests that
          incontrovertibly proved the reality of telepathy while revealing the
          vast, untold powers of the mind. In one room, Sinclair would make a
          drawing and place it into a sealed envelope, while in another, Mary
          would “tune in,” retrieve the image, and make her own copy. Or she
          would record a telepathic message sent from someone far away. Her
          accuracy rate was astonishing, leaving no room for random chance as an
          explanation, as they continued to collect scientific data over three
          years. In <i>Mental Radio</i>, Sinclair describes remarkable
          experiments, comparing telepathy to radio broadcasting, with one brain
          sending out a “vibration” and another picking it up. The results
          convinced Sinclair that telepathy is real, that it is unaffected by
          distance, that it can be cultivated, trained and—most importantly—can
          be verified and studied scientifically.<br /><br />For the first time
          in many years, here is the complete text of <i>Mental Radio</i>,
          including Mary Craig Kimbrough’s well-tested instructions on how to
          learn the “art of conscious mind-reading.” Here is the classic book
          that impressed Albert Einstein who, in his preface to
          <i>Mental Radio</i>, praises Sinclair for being a conscientious
          observer and writer and for his good faith and dependability in
          reporting paranormal research. William McDougall, known as the “dean
          of American psychology” at the time, was so inspired by Sinclair’s
          work that he established the parapsychology department at Duke
          University, which went on to become, for a time, the country’s premier
          paranormal research institution.
