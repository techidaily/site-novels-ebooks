            Two of our basic physical needs as humans are for food and drink.
            God, our creator placed within us a trigger switch that lets us know
            that our body is hungry and or thirsty. This happens in our natural
            bodies. That same principle is operating in our spirit, the part
            that God gave to every human. This spirit has a longing that only He
            can completely fill. Some try various things and ideologies and
            still come up empty, but Jesus is saying, "Come unto me, all ye that
            labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
            upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye
            shall find rest unto your souls" (Matthew 11:28-29, KJV, Emphasis
            mine). He is the only One who can supply, or better yet, fill that
            need. He made you and He know all about you and still says,
            come.Come with a Hunger, Come with a Thirst, Be Filled to Overflow
            was written for people who have a need, an emptiness that nothing
            has completely satisfied or filled. It is a God-induced hunger and
            thirst that He purposely placed in everyone. Many have "bumped" into
            Him along the way, not realizing at the time that He had set up the
            meeting. He cares that much and wants to completely fill those
            hungry and thirsty places. Matthew 5:6 states, "They shall be
            filled."This narrative, as I call it, is not one where you must
            start at the beginning to get a full understanding as to what is
            being addressed. If one chooses to start at the end or in the
            middle, it will be okay because all of it is about the multifaceted
            Holy God and how He has always had a plan to give each and every one
            what was needed in their life, and that included you! If you choose
            not to start at the beginning, you will still find His richness
            interwoven throughout the pages. He so much wants to fill each of us
            with what is needed to face and live this life while enlightening
            others along this journey. In some areas you will find it to be a
            devotional that day, giving direction for the many changes and
            challenges life brings. At times, you may find yourself laughing as
            you begin to see Jesus as both man and God, experiencing life as you
            do with its ups and downs. Tears of joy may fall from time to time
            because your spirit is in agreement by the thoughts He has been
            giving to you and now it is right before your eyes. Prepare to learn
            of some mysteries that you may have never heard before, but wondered
            about this never-ending Love story between humans and Divinity. God
            BLESS!
