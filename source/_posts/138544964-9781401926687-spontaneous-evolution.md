            >We’ve all heard stories of people who’ve experienced seemingly
            miraculous recoveries from illness, but can the same thing happen
            for our world? According to pioneering biologist Bruce H. Lipton,
            it’s not only possible, it’s already occurring. <br /></b
          ><br />In <i>Spontaneous Evolution</i>, this world-renowned expert in
          the emerging science of epigenetics reveals how our changing
          understanding of biology will help us navigate this turbulent period
          in our planet’s history and how each of us can participate in this
          global shift. <br /><br />In collaboration with political philosopher
          Steve Bhaerman, Dr. Lipton invites readers to reconsider the
          "unquestionable" pillars of biology, including:<br /><br />· random
          evolution, survival of the fittest, and the role of DNA; <br />· the
          relationship between mind and matter; <br />· how our beliefs about
          nature and human nature shape our politics, culture, and individual
          lives; and<br />· how each of us can become planetary "stem cells"
          supporting the health and growth of our world. <br /><br />By
          questioning the old beliefs that got us to where we are today and keep
          us stuck in the status quo, we can trigger the spontaneous evolution
          of our species that will usher in a brighter future.

        <p>
          “<i>Spontaneous Evolution </i>is the life-map we’ve all been waiting
          for! With just the right blend of spiritual humor and rock-solid
          science, Bruce Lipton and Steve Bhaerman cast a holistic new light on
          an emerging new civilization. They lead us beyond collapsing economies
          and religious extremes to show us that such chaos is a natural step in
          an unfolding process, rather than the tragic end to a broken planet.
          Once we recognize the big picture, the choices to a better life and a
          better world become obvious. The guiding role of Spontaneous Evolution
          is where our teachings of life, history, and civilization should
          begin. I love this book!”<br /><b>— Gregg Braden</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>The Divine Matrix </i>and<i> Fractal Time</i><br /><br />“The
          implications of this powerful book have the potential to change the
          world.”<br /><b>— Deepak Chopra</b>,
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Third Jesus</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Spontaneous Evolution</i> offers an enlightening view
          of humanity’s past, and an empowering vision of our ‘mammalian’
          destiny. Based on cellular biologist Bruce Lipton’s solid science,
          informed by Steve Bhaerman’s political insight and wit, this book is a
          must-read for anyone who seeks to lovingly transform the world, and
          fulfill her or his most creative and powerful self.”<br /><b
            >— Marianne Williamson</b
          >, author of <i>The Age of Miracles</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Spontaneous Evolution </i
          >is a world-changing book that offers a heartening view of humanity’s
          destiny. Built on the foundation of the latest discoveries in science,
          it points us in the direction of functional politics, sustainable
          economics, and individual responsibility in the context of an
          interdependent community.”<br /><b>— Thom Hartmann</b>, author of
          <i>The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight</i> <br /><br />“This wise and
          thoughtful book is a powerful antidote for anyone who is pessimistic
          and depressed about our future and the challenges we face as
          humans.”<br /><b>— Larry Dossey, M.D.</b>, author of
          <i>The Power of Premonitions</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Spontaneous Evolution</i
          >
          is a brilliant synthesis of science, evolutionary theory, and
          spiritual consciousness that provides a unique explanation of our
          global situation and how we might move forward to repair the world. It
          charts a path for a global ‘up-wising’ that could save us from
          planetary disaster, recognizing that both we as individuals and the
          global economic/political systems in which we operate, must evolve
          quickly to survive.”<br /><b>— Rabbi Michael Lerner</b>, editor of
          Tikkun magazine, chair of the interfaith Network of Spiritual
          Progressives, and author of <i>The Left Hand of God<br /></i
          ><br />“In&nbsp;<i>Spontaneous Evolution</i> the authors redefine our
          commonly accepted understanding of ‘evolutionary destiny,’ placing the
          responsibility right where it belongs: within the mindful awareness of
          every individual. Their presentation of ‘holism’ gives us all reason
          to be optimistic.”<br /><b>— Michael Bernard Beckwith</b>, author of
          <i>Spiritual Liberation</i><br /><br />“<i>Spontaneous Evolution</i>
          is an eye-opening, mind-expanding, and paradigm-shifting journey. The
          alchemy that happens when Bruce Lipton’s cogent articulation of
          cellular biology and physics joins Steve Bhaerman’s lucid explanations
          of social, political, and economic science produces a coherent depth
          of ‘field’ perspective that is both illuminating and inspiring. Bruce
          and Steve have given us a guidebook for becoming sane in a
          dysfunctional world.”<br /><b>— Nicki Scully</b>, author of
          <i>Alchemical Healing</i> <br /><br />“<i>Spontaneous Evolution</i> is
          a great book, a vital message, and even more, it embodies Causal
          Evolution. By understanding and incorporating its wise revelation of
          how nature works, we can cause the future we intend. The future that
          emerges from this Whole New Story is so attractive that I believe it
          will encourage us to fulfill our true hearts’ desire for more love,
          more life, more creativity NOW.”<br /><b>— Barbara Marx Hubbard</b>,
          founder of The Foundation for Conscious Evolution<br /><br />“An
          extraordinary and timeless gift to humanity.”<br /><b
            >— Leonard Laskow M.D.</b
          >, author of<i> Healing with Love</i><br /><br />“The future you dream
          of is as close as your own cells!&nbsp;<i>Spontaneous Evolution</i> is
          a wonderfully exciting, enlightening, and heartening ride! Read it and
          know exactly where we stand and how we can thrive.”<br /><b
            >— Elisabet Sahtouris, Ph.D.</b
          >, evolution biologist, futurist, professor, speaker, and
          consultant<br /><br />“Fromimaginal cells to cellular transformation,
          <i>Spontaneous Evolution&nbsp;</i>demonstrates the power of thought
          and intention in manifesting systemic change in both personal and
          social consciousness. The mix of leading-edge science and
          social/political awareness renders this book a must-read for all those
          working to create a more just, sustainable, and peaceful world.”<br /><b
