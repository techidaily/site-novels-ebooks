            SWEAT BATHING HAS BEEN as common to people as the making of bread
            and the squeezing of the grape. Numerous cultures through history
            have discovered that the sweat bath, in one form or another,
            enlivens both body and spirit. Although sweat bathing has only
            recently en­tered America’s contemporary life, it thrived here long
            before Col­umbus in the form of sweat lodges and temescals.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine literally sweating yourself around the world, as Mikkel
            Aaland did-lying on a marble slab in a Turkish hammam enduring a
            delicious pummeling by a fierce masseur or basking in the profound
            tranquility of a mushi-buro in Kyoto. Aaland spent three years on
            his pilgrimage sweating with people in far parts of the world-in the
            ancient smoke saunas (savusaunas) of rural Finland, boisterous
            banias in Russia, neighborly temescals in a Mexican village, and a
            Navajo sweat lodge in the Southwest.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaland&nbsp;brought back a rich store of photographs and experience
            from his world travels. His book&nbsp;is a revelation. “Sweat is
            beautiful,” he declares. They used to say that only horses sweat,
            that men perspire and women glow, thereby suggesting that sweating
            is undesirable and should be suppressed by anti-perspirants.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaland touches a sensitive nerve in the gentile and those of us who
            don’t sweat for a living. He explains that if we don’t sweat
            regularly, we deprive ourselves of a vital bodily function. The skin
            is our body’s largest and most complex organ and plays an important
            role in our fitness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaland has a vision of public saunas appearing on street corners
            throughout America, trail sweats glowing in mountain campsites,
            sweat baths in schools, skyscrapers and factories-a vision of people
            everywhere basking in the healthful warmth and camaraderie of a
            sweat bath.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Sweat bathing, undoubtedly, is more important now in these
            seden­tary times than ever before, in the same sense that so many of
            us have turned to jogging, tennis and jumping rope to keep our
            bodies alive.

          "When I was a kid in the 70s and 80s it wasn't a credible hippie
          household unless there was a copy of Sweat by Mikkel Aaland floating
          around." --Jessica Kelso, owner Löyly Sauna, Portland, Oregon.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mikkel Aaland provides a comprehensive, overview of the different
          forms of group sweating, both past and present, used in cultures
          throughout the world in countries including Russia, Japan, Finland,
          Mexico, Turkey, Greece, and the United States (1978). These works
          provide rich descriptions of the cultural importance of group
          sweating." --Stephen A. Colman, doctoral thesis.

          "Recognised as a profoundly social form of bathing, the most famous
          celebration of [the sweat bathing] tradition is Mikkel Aaland’s
