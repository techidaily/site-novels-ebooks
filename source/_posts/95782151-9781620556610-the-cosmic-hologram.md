          How holographic patterns of information underlie our physical
          reality<br /><br />• 2017 Nautilus Silver Award<br /><br />• Includes
          myriad evidence from a wide range of cutting-edge scientific
          discoveries showing our Universe is an interconnected hologram of
          information<br /><br />• Explains how consciousness is a major
          component of the cosmic hologram of information, making us both
          manifestations and co-creators of our reality<br /><br />• Reconciles
          Quantum Mechanics and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity by showing that
          energy-matter and space-time are complementary expressions of
          information<br /><br />Our understanding of the Universe is about to
          transform at all levels, from the tiniest Planck scale to the vast
          reaches of space. Recent scientific discoveries show that the
          information that upholds all of our modern technologies is exactly the
          same as the universal in-formation that underpins, pervades, and is
          all we call physical reality.<br /><br />Exploring how information is
          more fundamental than energy, matter, space, or time, Jude Currivan,
          Ph.D., examines the latest research across many fields of study and
          many scales of existence to show how our Universe is in-formed and
          holographically manifested. She explains how the fractal
          in-formational patterns that guide behavior at the atomic level also
          guide the structure of galactic clusters in space. She demonstrates
          how the in-formational relationships that underlie earthquakes are the
          same as those that play out during human conflicts. She shows how
          cities grow in the same in-formational ways that galaxies evolve and
          how the dynamic in-formational forms that pervade ecosystems are
          identical to the informational structures of the Internet and our
          social behaviors. Demonstrating how information is physically real,
          the author explores how consciousness connects us to the many
          interconnected layers of universal in-formation, making us both
          manifestations and co-creators of the cosmic hologram of reality. She
          explains how Quantum Mechanics and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity can
          at last be reconciled if we consider energy-matter and space-time as
          complementary expressions of information, and she explores how the
          cosmic hologram underlies the true origin of species and our own
          evolution.<br /><br />Concurring too with ancient spiritual wisdom,
          the author offers solid evidence that consciousness is not something
          we “have” but the fundamental nature of what we and the entire
          Universe are. With this understanding, we can each transform our own
          lives and help co-create and in-form the world around us.

        <p>
          “Based on her extensive knowledge of quantum physics, cosmology and
          the many and latest discoveries about the evolution of our Universe as
          well as the emergent understanding of the pervasive unity and
          wholeness of an all-encompassing mind, Jude Currivan comes in her very
          impressive and important book <i>The Cosmic Hologram</i> to the
          inevitable conclusion that the physical world is literally the
          expression of informational processes: both space and time are
          emergent phenomena of the informational cosmic hologram. Our Universe
          is innately coherent and non-locally unified, where everything is
          interconnected and informational in nature. The perspective about the
          cosmic hologram and the fundamental nature of reality helps us to
          better comprehend the unity of consciousness in the universe. This
          transformational insight is supported by the frequently reported
          experiences of cosmic awareness, where one is able to access accurate
          and verifiable information at nonlocal levels. Highly recommended.”
