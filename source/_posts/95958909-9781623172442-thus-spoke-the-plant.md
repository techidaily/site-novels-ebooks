            >A research scientist’s fascinating study of plant communication
            reveals how we “have been misunderstanding plants, and ourselves,
            for all of history” (<i>The Paris Review</i>).<br /></b

            >“A compelling story of discovery . . . [that] will change the way
            you see the world”—for fans of
            <i>The Hidden Life of Trees</i> (Robin Wall Kimmerer, author of
            <i>Braiding Sweetgrass</i>)</b
          ><br /><br />
          In this “<i>phyto</i>biography”—a collection of stories written in
          partnership with a plant—research scientist Monica Gagliano shares
          genuine first-hand accounts from her research into plant communication
          and cognition. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          By transcending the view of plants as the objects of scientific
          materialism, Gagliano encourages us to rethink plants as people—beings
          with subjectivity, consciousness, and volition, and hence having the
          capacity for their own perspectives and voices. The book draws on
          up-close-and-personal encounters with the plants themselves, as well
          as plant shamans, indigenous elders, and mystics from around the world
          and integrates these experiences with an incredible research journey
          and the groundbreaking scientific discoveries that emerged from it.
          <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Gagliano has published numerous peer-reviewed scientific papers on how
          plants have a Pavlov-like response to stimuli and can learn, remember,
          and communicate to neighboring plants. She has pioneered the brand-new
          research field of plant bioacoustics, for the first time
          experimentally demonstrating that plants emit their own 'voices' and,
          moreover, detect and respond to the sounds of their environments. By
          demonstrating experimentally that learning is not the exclusive
          province of animals, Gagliano has re-ignited the discourse on plant
          subjectivity and ethical and legal standing. This is the story of how
          she made those discoveries and how the plants helped her along the
          way.

          “In this revelatory new book, we are brought into the presence of
          gifted storytellers in three different forms: a scientist, traditional
          plant practitioners, and the plants themselves. Gagliano’s discoveries
          uproot assumptions about the plant world as insensate, revealing their
          capacities to listen, learn and remember. This is a compelling story
          of discovery at many levels, simultaneously personal, scientific, and
          spiritual. It will change the way you see the world.”<br />—Dr. Robin
          Wall Kimmerer, SUNY Distinguished Teaching Professor, director of the
          Center for Native Peoples and the Environment, and author of&nbsp;<i
            >Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge, and
            the Teachings of Plants</i
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“Beautifully written and thought provoking,
          this book brings to light the relationship of an accomplished
          evolutionary ecologist deeply rooted in Western science and culture,
          and some plant species, which guide her through dreams and visions
          with the support of indigenous wise women and men. An inspiration for
          those willing to listen to the many voices of nature, living as we are
          in an animated intelligent world we are rapidly destroying.”<br />&nbsp;—Luis
          Eduardo Luna, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Vegetalismo: Shamanism Among the Mestizo Population of the Peruvian
            Amazon</i

            >Ayahuasca Visions: The Religious Iconography of a Peruvian
            Shaman</i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“In part guided by indigenous shamans, in part by
          the author’s own cultivated receptivity, Gagliano dives into isolation
          with various plant species which have been recognized as having strong
          voices that humans can hear. She consults with plants that give
          specific instructions about how to prove botanical consciousness in
          both the seen and unseen worlds.”<br />—Kathleen Harrison, MA,
          ethnobotanist, Botanical Dimensions<br /><br />“Those who wish to see
          how a shamanic approach can help advance the<br />scientific
          understanding of plants need to read this wonderful book.<br />Monica
          Gagliano opens up new frontiers and her methods deserve broad<br />attention.”<br />—Jeremy
          Narby, PhD,&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<i>The Cosmic Serpent<br /><br /></i
          >“A cure for biases and preconceptions. An antidote to tunnel vision.
          A book that reverberates well after you’ve laid it down. Gagliano’s
          brave disclosures, both professional and personal, transcend
          plants.&nbsp;<i>Thus Spoke the Plant</i>&nbsp;is about them, if
          only&nbsp;through&nbsp;the author’s out-of-the-box way of listening to
          plants. As in a pairing of food and wine that blurs the boundaries
          between the ingredients, you will not think of science and intuitions
          as detached anymore. Thus spoke Gagliano.”<br />&nbsp;—Professor Paco
          Calvo, director of the&nbsp;Minimal Intelligence Lab&nbsp;(MINT Lab)

          >(Minnesota University Press, 2017). Her work has extended the concept
          of cognition (including perception, learning processes, memory and
          consciousness) in plants. Gagliano has pioneered the brand-new
