            A Living Epistle, Read by All Men brings clarity to what it means to
            be a Christian and sets forth an expectation for those who profess
            the Christian faith. This book simplifies grace and mercy so that
            the average reader can understand reconciliation with God through
            the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. This book also exposes
            carnality to help Christians understand the reality of thinking like
            the world. It further interprets mental anguish from a spiritual
            perspective so that the Body of Christ can overcome by tapping into
            a greater strength using the mind of Christ. Specifically, in
            Chapter 2 Carnality Exposed, the writer uses the wisdom of God to
            explain the usefulness and availability of the mind of Christ and
            reveals the mechanics Satan uses to keep Christians thinking
            carnally. Even more specifically, the author explains how carnality
            destroys a persons understanding, which prevents the truth about
            Jesus Christ through deception.

            A Living Epistle, Read by All Men offers its reader fresh oils using
            the simplicity of the gospel. It further separates the doctrine of
            Christ from false doctrine by pointing out key doctrinal tricks used
            by Satan in an attempt to hinder the truth about Jesus.
            Specifically, the author makes several distinctions about false
            prophets, false prophecy, and false doctrine so that readers can
            separate the doctrinally correct from the doctrinally incorrect. The
            author also humanized certain points of the book, humoring it so
            that readers can grasp the context of the message.

            A Living Epistle, Read by All Men comes to:Bring a fresh revelation
            from the Word of God to spiritually enrich, encourage, and exhort
            the Body of Christ. Make a distinction between those who follow
            Christ and those who do not follow Christ so that people can choose
            Jesus Christ over the world and the anti-Christ.Lift up the
            bloodstained banner of the gospel of Jesus Christ so that people may
            experience for themselves the exceeding greatness of His power
            toward us who believe.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Unbelievers do not know Jesus Christ neither can they discern Him.
            The gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness to them, but to us who
            have salvation, it reveals the power of God. Non-believers may never
            attend church, go to a prayer conference, or read the Holy Bible.
            For many, reading the life of an authentic Christian is reading the
            Bible because Jesus goes forth from that life. Christian Believers
            are living messages of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore, it is
            important for Christian Believers to spread the message of Jesus
            uncompromisingly, with authentic love, characteristically both in
            speech and in conduct.
