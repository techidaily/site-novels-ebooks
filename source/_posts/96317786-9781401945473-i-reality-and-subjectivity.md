            >Experience spiritual enlightenment and personal transformation from
            world-renowned author, psychiatrist, clinician, spiritual teacher,
            and researcher of consciousness, David R. Hawkins, M.D., Ph.D.</b
          ><br /><b><br /></b>This book combines consciousness studies with
          transpersonal psychology, providing an accessible gateway into the
          deeper dimensions of self and reality.<br /><br />It concludes the
          presentation of a long-predicted major advance in critical human
          knowledge. It explains and describes the very substrate and essence of
          consciousness as it evolved from its primordial appearance as life on
          earth on up through evolution as the human ego, and hence, to the
          ego’s transcendence as the spiritual Reality of Enlightenment and the
          Presence of Divinity.<br /><br />It completes the description of the
          evolution of human consciousness from the level of approximately 800
          to its peak experience at 1,000, which historically has been the
          ultimate possibility in the human domain. This is the realm of the
          mystic whose truth stems solely from the radical subjectivity of
          divine revelation.<br /><br />The text of the material is taken from
          lectures, dissertations, and dialogues with students, visitors, and
          spiritual aspirants from around the world who have different spiritual
          and religious backgrounds and varying levels of consciousness.<br /><br />On
          the referenced Scale of the Levels of consciousness, which calibrates
          the levels of Truth from 1 to 1,000, Power versus Force calibrates at
          850, The Eye of the I at 980, and the final volume of the trilogy, I,
          calibrates at a conclusive 999.8. The uncommon clarity and lucidity
          with which the highly evolved subject matter is presented facilitates
          understanding.<br /><br />As with the reading of Power versus Force or
          The Eye of the I, the reader’s level of consciousness increases
          measurably as a consequence of exposure to this material itself, which
          is presented from a powerful field of exposition.<br /><br />Conflict
          is resolved within the mind of the student by means of
          recontextualization, which solves the dilemma. Argument and adversity
          are resolvable by identifying the positionalities of the ego which are
          the basis of human suffering.<br /><br />Some Chapters Include:<br /><br /><b
            >The Process</b
          ><br />Spiritual Purification<br />The ‘Ego’ and Society<br />Spiritual
          Reality<br />Realization<br /><b>The Realization of Divinity</b
          ><br />The Radical Reality of the Self<br />The Mystic<br />The Levels
          of Enlightenment<br />The Nature of God<br /><b>The Obstacles</b
          ><br />Transcending the World<br />The Emotions<br />“Mind”<br />Considerations<br />Karma<br />The
          Final Doorway<br />The Transcendence<br />The Inner Path<br />“No
          Mind”<br />The Way of the Heart<br /><b>The Recontextualization</b
          ><br />Spiritual Research<br />Homo Spiritus<br /><br />This
          masterpiece is a revolutionary tool for personal transformation,
          blending quantum physics with spirituality, and a perfect read for
          anyone seeking enlightenment and a deeper understanding of the
          universe.
