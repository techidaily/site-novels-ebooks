            >
          </p>
          <p><strong>What would such a day feel like?</strong></p>
          <p>
            If you're looking for a toolkit that could help you with practices
            and techniques to calm the mind, open the heart and restore the
            spirit, this is it.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Open your mind and heart to possibility.</strong></p>
          <p>
            You are invited to embark on a journey, one in which you will learn
            the secrets of crafting a life that flows smoothly every day. This
            adventure will take you into the interesting space where continuous
            flow meets wellness practices and the discovery of your inner self.
          </p>
          <p>
            What lies beyond our physical selves is a cohesive interconnecting
            field of energy, and the ease and flow with which your life unfolds
            is influenced by your understanding and interaction with the
            powerful forces embedded in this field.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the healing techniques offered here are accessible to
            everyone, their power lies in giving you access to the healing love
            that exists within this field and within yourself. As you connect
            with this field, you gently shift towards an awakened life that
            flows easily 24/7.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Awakening often comes out of sorrow.</strong></p>
          <p>
            Yet, even in your darkest hours following such loss, you are never
            alone, the universe is supportive, and there is life after life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >The daily rituals, diverse practices, and universal truths
              presented within these pages will profoundly enrich your
              life.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            They serve as pillars that will support your ongoing journey. Most
            importantly, they will give you the information and motivation to
            formulate your 'around the clock' flow schedule so you can awaken to
            a life that flows with ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of this book as a toolkit for mind, heart, body and spirit. In
            this toolkit are practices that you may do now, and there are
            practices that may be new to you. What makes this book unique is the
            marriage of science and spirituality.
          </p>
          <p>
            By understanding the miraculous organism that is your human body,
            the practices and why they work become clearer. You may find
            yourself drawn to a particular practice and not others. That is
            fine. Allow your intuition to guide you as you read and work with
            the concept of 24/7 flow. Each chapter offers one specific technique
            from your toolkit that is transformative.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book is organized to take you into a day. Yet the techniques
            offered expand beyond the boundaries of any one day. They are life
            techniques to be drawn on, so you can create your unique
            interpretation of 24/7 flow that works for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you read Chapter One, you'll get to know the journeys of the
            authors and how each came to the healing state of flow. Start your
            relationship with the book there, and take the self-assessment in
            Chapter One - as that will confirm for you how this book and this
            toolkit might speak to your life today.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then delve into Chapter Two and rethink how your usual day begins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every day is a new beginning, and what you make of that beginning
            can set the tone for your experience of the entire day. Explore each
            chapter and incorporate what resonates with you at this point in
            your life. Choose what calls to you. This book is a toolkit that can
            be used in part or whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approach the book as a woven tapestry of threads combining daily
            practices, stories that inspire, activities, and the transformative
            strength found in being brave beyond the usual ideas of health. The
            tools are provided but it is you, and only you, who can create your
            personal blueprint for a life of flow and ease.
          </p>
