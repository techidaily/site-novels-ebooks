          <br />The Book of Secrets is a step by step guide to find the best
          meditation suitable for you.<br /><br />112 methods of meditation are
          described and introduced here with helpful background information to
          give contemporary people a door to meditation.<br /><br />Reading this
          book, not only will your outlook on life change, but so will your
          life. If you want to know more about life and yourself this is your
          book.<br /><br />Each chapter that focuses on describing specific
          meditation techniques is followed by a chapter of questions from those
          who were present during the talks. In most cases, their questions
          relate to the techniques given in the previous chapter. So, as you
          start to experiment with a technique, it will be helpful to look into
          these chapters for some extra hint, some greater depth of
          understanding, or response to a question that might have arisen for
          you in your experiments.

          <br />"These one hundred and twelve methods of meditation constitute
          the whole science of transforming mind. We will enter them one by
          one."<br /><br /><br />" That is why more people go for a prayer than
          for meditation because prayer gives you a consolation. It fits you,
          adjusts to you, to your world. Prayer was doing virtually the same
          thing that psychoanalysts are now doing. If you are disturbed they
          will make you less disturbed, adjusted to the pattern, to the society,
          to the family. So by going to a psychoanalyst for one, two or three
          years you will not get better, but you will be more adjusted. Prayer
          does the same thing, and priests do the same thing they make you more
          adjusted."<br /><br />"Meditation is a science. It is not going to
          help you in adjustment, it is going to help you in transformation.
          That is why I say these three signs will be there as indications.
          Silence will come, but not as an adjustment. Silence will come as an
          inner flowering. Then silence will not be an adjustment with the
          society, with the family, the world, the business no! Then silence
          will be a real harmony with the universe."<br /><br />"Is it true that
          you do not have any time? Really? You do not have any time to meditate
          to give one hour to meditation? Think twice. Ask again and again to
          the mind, Is this the case, that I do not have any time?‚Äù"<br /><br />"The
          moment you go deep in meditation, you will not survive on this earth
          at least you will disappear. From the circle of this life, this wheel,
          you will disappear. Meditation is like death, so the mind becomes
          afraid. Meditation is like love, so the mind becomes afraid. "
