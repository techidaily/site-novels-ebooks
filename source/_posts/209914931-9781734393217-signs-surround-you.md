          <p>Do We Ever Really Die?</p>
          <p>
            This is the true story of an unsuspecting mother who falls in love,
            and has a two-year relationship, with rock and roll’s music legend
            Mark Abrahamian, the lead guitarist of the band Starship. In love,
            she discovers life’s greatest joys as she is transformed by a
            connection that is deeper than anything she has ever known before.
            After parting ways and having no contact for three years, one day
            she has a terrible “knowing” that Mark died – and it was true. He
            had had a fatal heart attack two days earlier, shortly after
            stepping off the stage at the end of a concert. He was only 46. Her
            life was irrevocably changed... twice. First, when he was alive --
            and then after his tragic death.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            From the Other Side, Mark soon begins flooding her with astonishing
            communications in the form of music, dreams and uncanny
            synchronicities that are so incredible she can not deny something
            truly magical is happening. Is it possible we never really die? The
            signs Mark sent will astound you and may even help you to begin to
            recognize messages from your own loved ones on the Other Side. We
            are all capable of tapping into the signs that surround us, because
            love never dies…

          It is said that composer Johannes Sebastian Bach’s final words were,
          "Don't cry for me, for I go where music is born.” In Ancient Greece,
          Orpheus, endowed with superhuman musical skills, was able to navigate
          the underworld and charm even Hades with his songs. Throughout the
          centuries, music is associated with powers beyond our own, in the
          realm of the afterlife. Laurie Majka brings together music and the
          communications of her beloved in her fascinating book Signs Surround
          You. She offers a modern-day account of how a musician, the man she
          loves, brings her a connection to the other side and convinces her
          that, indeed, our loved ones can communicate with us even after death.
          Her story carries mythic importance, for it resonates with the tales
          over the centuries that bring together the makers of music with the
          mysteries of a world beyond this one.
