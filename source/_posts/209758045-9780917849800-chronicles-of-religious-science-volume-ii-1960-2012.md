          Building on the history documented in
          <i>Chronicles of Religious Science Volume I</i>, this second volume
          opens with the transition of Ernest Holmes in 1960. Each chapter
          highlights the growth and decisions of the Church of Religious Science
          and Religious Science International as the organizations grew and
          eventually merged back into one whole in 2012. Based on interviews,
          quotes, meeting minutes and commentary, these two volumes capture the
          essence of Religious Science and preserve its history for future
          generations.<br /><br /><i
            >Chronicles of Religious Science Volume II</i
          >
          is truly a work of heart by Dr. Marilyn Leo, “Living Treasure” and
          former neighbor to Ernest and Hazel Holmes. Dr. Leo delves deep into
          the oracles and wisdom of the Science of Mind Archives to share key
          events in the evolution of Science of Mind. In this book, we honor the
          transition of our founder, Dr. Ernest Holmes, in 1960, and we
          celebrate the healing and uniting of our movement in 2011-12. "This is
          a valuable resource and an essential read for anyone who has been
          touched by this profound teaching." —
          <b>Rev. Kathy Mastroianni </b>Executive Director, Science of Mind
          Archives and Library Foundation<br /><br />
          This latest volume of <i>Chronicles of Religious Science</i> embodies
          the spirit of our founder, Dr. Ernest Holmes’, statement that
          Religious Science should always remain “open at the top.” It opens the
          reader to the unfolding story of this amazing movement. In so doing,
          it is a valuable resource to every practitioner of the Science of
          Mind. "Dr. Marilyn Leo has a way of answering the questions of the
          curious in this, her latest contribution to Religious Science. Enjoy
          your journey through the annals of one of the major contributors to
          the Science of Mind." — <b>Rev. Stephen Rambo</b>, Spiritual Leader,
          CSL Simi
          Valley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;<br /><br />
          "Ernest Holmes writes, “When, through intuition, faith finds its
          proper place under Divine Law, there are no limitations, and what are
          called miraculous results follow.” The Chronicles of Religious Science
          II is one of those miraculous efforts. I offer deep gratitude to
          Marilyn Leo for capturing the essence and details of so many aspects
          of the life of Holmes and the Religious Science movement and honor the
          keen minds and huge hearts who worked tirelessly to bring it to you.
          Holmes also writes, “A thought of love is always healing.” May this
          work be a loving support to you on your spiritual path. The journey
          continues." — <b>Rev. David Goldberg</b>, Ph.D. Past Publisher and

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Marilyn Leo</b> has been part of Religious Science since childhood.
          Her father, Reginald Armor, was very close to Ernest Holmes, beginning
          in 1915, when Reginald was a boy of twelve. Their families remained
          intimate throughout Holmes’ life. Marilyn has served on many
          committees and served United Church (now Centers for Spiritual Living)
          as director of the World Ministry of Prayer, Ecclesiastical
          Officer/Vice President, Organizational Renewal Project, chair of the
          Global Ministries. She also served as president, secretary, and
          treasurer (at different times) for the Wisdom Council (retired
          ministers’ association). She has received several special
          recognitions, including the “Living Treasure Award” given by her
          ministerial colleagues. In 2009,&nbsp;&nbsp; Marilyn received the
          “Golden Heart Award,” also given by the United Clergy of Religious
          Science. United Church has honored her with honorary Doctor of
          Divinity and Doctor of Religious Science recognitions.<br /><br />
          Though retired from the usual ministerial duties, she has served as
          president of the Science of Mind Archives and Library Foundation, and
          presently serves on the Board of Trustees for The Hefferlin
          Foundation, an independent nonprofit foundation supporting the
          teaching of Science of Mind. In that capacity she is secretary of the
          board and co-chair of the Education/Scholarship Committee. Marilyn is
          the author of
          <i
            >Chronicles of Religions Science, Volume I: The Early Years, 1926
            through 1959</i
          >. Besides her book, <i>In His Company: Ernest Holmes Remembered</i>,
          she has written articles for <i>Science of Mind</i> and
          <i>Creative Thought</i> magazines, contributed the manuscript for
          <i>That Was Ernest</i> written by her father, Dr. Reginald Armor, and
          published by DeVorss &amp; Company. She compiled and edited
          <i>Love and Law </i>published by J. Tarcher/Putnam/Penguin, and she
          wrote the foreword for John Waterhouse’s book
          <i>Five Steps to Freedom</i>, which, incidentally, has been translated
          to Spanish and Russian and has become required reading for some
          Science of Mind classes. It is also being created as an audio book.
          Marilyn has been working in the Religious Science Archives for fifteen
          years and created the Archives and Library Foundation, a nonprofit
          organization that houses all archival information for Centers for
          Spiritual Living. It is a “living archive” in that there are
          constantly additions being made. Visit the website
          www.ScienceofMindArchives.com.
