            Research shows that Chinese medicine can be very effective in
            supporting the treatment of cancer by orthodox Western methods, and
            is particularly effective in alleviating many of the side effects of
            treatment. Henry McGrath draws on his many years as a practitioner
            of Traditional Chinese Medicine to explain how Chinese medicine
            approaches cancer in terms of understanding and treatment. He
            presents the wide range of approaches that Chinese medicine has to
            offer people with cancer, and offers practical strategies to promote
            the health of the body as well as methods with which to cultivate
            the mind, helping the patient develop both physical and mental
            wellbeing. He covers a wide range of treatments, from acupuncture to
            Qigong, giving readers a sound basis on which to explore further
            specific treatment. <br /><br />Traditional Chinese Medicine
            Approaches to Cancer will be an invaluable book for people with
            cancer and the medical professionals who work with them.

          Henry McGrath has made great contributions to the improvement of
          professional education in Chinese medicine. In this much-needed book
          he clearly explains Chinese medicine to a lay audience. It shows that
          there is a solid research base behind the practice of Chinese
          medicine, and gives clear information to those with cancer.
