              brilliant and brave investigation&nbsp;into the medical and
              scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs--and
              the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic
              experiences
            </b></b
          ><br /><br />When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and
          psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used
          to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat
          conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not
          intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon
          discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives
          not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to
          grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the
          landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus
          began a singular adventure into various altered states of
          consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain
          science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic
          therapists. Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth
          about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them
          since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists
          inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a
          promising field of research.<br /><br />A unique and elegant blend of
          science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine,
          <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> is a triumph of participatory
          journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account
          of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our
          understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The
          true subject of Pollan's "mental travelogue" is not just psychedelic
          drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a
          world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be
          fully present and find meaning in our lives.

          “Pollan’s deeply researched chronicle will enlighten those who think
          of psychedelics chiefly as a kind of punchline to a joke about the
          Woodstock generation and hearten the growing number&nbsp;who view them
          as a potential antidote to our often stubbornly narrow minds . . .
          engaging and informative.” —<b><i>Boston Globe</i></b
          ><br />
          <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b
          ><br />
          “Pollan keeps you turning the pages . . . cleareyed and assured.” —<b
            ><i>New York Times<br /></i></b
          ><br />“Michael Pollan’s
          <i>How to Change Your Mind: The New Science of Psychedelics </i
          >changed my mind, or at least some of the ideas held in my mind. . . .
          Whatever one may think of psychedelics, the book reminds us that the
          mind is the greatest mystery in the universe, that this mystery is
          always right here, and that we usually dedicate far too little time
          and energy to exploring it.” —<b
            >Yuval Noah Harari, author of <i>Sapiens</i> and
            <i>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          “A deep dive into the history of psychedelics . . . . Deliciously
          trippy.” —<b><i>NY Post</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Amid new scientific interest in the potential healing
          properties of psychedelic drugs, Pollan . . . sets about researching
          their history—and giving them a (supervised!) try himself.&nbsp; He
          came away impressed by their promise in treating addiction and
          depression—and with his mind expanded.&nbsp; Yours will be too.” —<b
            ><i>People</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Astounding.” —<b
            >Andrew Sullivan,&nbsp;<i>New York Magazine</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Sweeping and often thrilling . . . . It is to Pollan’s
          credit that, while he ranks among the best of science writers, he’s
          willing, when necessary, to abandon that genre’s fixation on
          materialist explanation as the only path to understanding. One of the
          book’s important messages is that the therapeutic benefits of
          psychedelics, for the dying or seriously ill, can’t be separated from
          the mystical experiences to which they give rise.” —<b
            ><i>The Guardian</i></b
          >
          <br /><br />“Makes a compelling case for the potential value of
          psychedelic experiences.” —<b><i>Pittsburgh Post Gazette</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Journalist Michael Pollan explored psychoactive plants
          in <i>The Botany of Desire&nbsp;</i>(2001). In this bold, intriguing
          study, he delves further…Pollan even ‘shakes the snow globe’ himself,
          chemically self-experimenting in the spirit of psychologist William
          James, who speculated about the wilder shores of consciousness more
          than a century ago.” —<b>Nature, International Journal of Science</b
          ><br /><br />“Revelatory . . . Immensely fascinating . . . Pollan
          approaches his subject as a science writer and a skeptic endowed with
          equal parts rigorous critical thinking and openminded curiosity.” —<b
            >Maria Popova, <i>Brainpickings</i></b
          >
          <br /><br />"Pollan,&nbsp;<i>Cooked</i>, 2013,&nbsp; has long
          enlightened and entertained readers with his superbly inquisitive and
          influential books about food. He now investigates a very different
          sort of comestible, psychedelics (from the Greek: “mind manifesting”),
          and what they reveal about consciousness and the brain.&nbsp; Pollan’s
          complexly elucidating and enthralling inquiry combines fascinating and
          significant history with daring and resonant reportage and memoir, and
          looks forward to a new open-mindedness toward psychedelics and the
          benefits of diverse forms of consciousness.” —<b
            ><i>Booklist </i>(starred review</b
          >)<br /><br />“Pollan,&nbsp;<i>Cooked,</i>&nbsp;shifts his focus to
          other uses of plants in this brilliant history of psychedelics across
          cultures and generations, the neuroscience of its effects, the revival
          of research on its potential to heal mental illness—and his own
          mind-changing trips . . . . This nuanced and sophisticated
          exploration, which asks big questions about meaning-making and
          spiritual experience, is thought-provoking and eminently readable.”
          —<b><i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “A trip well worth taking, eye-opening and even mind-blowing.” —<b
            ><i>Kirkus</i> (starred review)</b
          ><br /><br />“Known for his writing on plants and food, Michael Pollan
          . . . brings all the curiosity and skepticism for which he is well

          ><br /><br />“I've never regretted my adolescent use of LSD, but
          reading this&nbsp;fascinating, lucid, wise and hopeful book did make
          me wonder if those drug experiences weren't another example of youth
          wasted on the young. Michael Pollan, who waited until he was a grownup
          to experiment, is the perfect guide to today’s dawning psychedelic
          renaissance.”&nbsp;<b>—Kurt Andersen, author of <i>Fantasyland </i></b

          “Michael Pollan masterfully guides us through the highs, lows, and
          highs again of psychedelic drugs.
          <i>How to Change Your mind</i> chronicles how it’s been a longer and
          stranger trip than most any of us knew.”&nbsp;<b

          “Very few writers, if any, have the gravitas and journalistic cred to
          tackle this explosive subject—from both the outside and the
          inside—extract it from its nationally traumatic and irrationally over
          reactive past, and bring both reason and revelatory insight to it.
          Michael Pollan has done just that. This is investigative journalism at
          its rigorous and compelling best—and radically mind opening in so many
          ways just to read it.”&nbsp;<b
            >—Jon Kabat-Zinn, founder of mindfulness-based stress reduction, and
            author of <i>Full Catastrophe Living</i> and
            <i>Coming to Our Senses</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Michael Pollan assembles a great deal of information here on the
          history, science, and effects of psychedelics. I found his frank
          recounting of his recent experiences with LSD, psilocybin, and toad
          venom most revealing. They appear to have softened his materialistic
          views and opened him to the possibilities of higher consciousness. He
          did, indeed, change his mind.”&nbsp;<b
            >—Andrew Weil, author of <i>The Natural Mind</i> and
            <i>8 Weeks to Optimum Health</i></b
          ><br /><br />"Do psychedelics open a door to a different reality, or
          is it just the same-old, same-old reality seen through a different set
          of lenses? I quickly became engrossed in Pollan’s narrative—the
          intersection of science, consciousness-enhancing, and government
          prohibition. But at the center of Pollan’s story is the greatest
          conundrum of all—why should substances that have been so beneficial to
          so many people, be the focus of crazy criminal penalties? Why,
          indeed.” —<b>Errol Morris</b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Michael Pollan has applied his brilliant mind and fastidious prose to
          the Mind itself, specifically the modes by which psychedelic
          substances temporarily obliterate the ego and engender deep spiritual
          connectedness to the universe. Michael walks the tight-rope between an
          objective ‘reporter’ and a spiritual pilgrim seeking insight and
          sustenance from psychedelics, and his innocence and integrity serve as
          a balance bar between cynicism and partisan affirmation. His success
          here places these drugs and what they do at the center of a potential
          revolution in medicine. It’s an extraordinary achievement, and no
          matter what you may think you know about psychedelics, if you even
          know the word, you should read this book.”&nbsp;<b
            >—Peter Coyote, author and Zen Buddhist Priest</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “After 50 years underground, psychedelics are back. We are incredibly
          fortunate to have Michael Pollan be our travel guide for their
          renaissance. With humility, humor, and deep humanity, he takes us
          through the history, the characters, and the science of these “mind
          manifesting” compounds. Along the way, he navigates the mysteries of
          consciousness, spirituality, and the mind. What he has done previously
          for gardeners and omnivores, Pollan does brilliantly here for all of
          us who wonder what it means to be fully human, or even what it means
          to be." —<b
            >Thomas R. Insel, MD, former director of National Institute of
            Mental Health and co-founder and president of Mindstrong Health</b
          ><br /><br />“A rare and utterly engrossing exposition that will most
          certainly delineate a fundamental change in the understanding of the
          human mind and the mystery of consciousness. Pollan previously
          reshaped our knowledge of earthly landscapes in his writings. With
          this book, he transforms our understanding of the innerscape, the
          unbounded world we occupy every conscious second of our life
          experienced by thoughts, suffering, awareness, joy, and reasoning.
          This is more than a book—it is a treasure." —<b
