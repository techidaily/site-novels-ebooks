            discovered dwarf planets Ceres, Eris, and Sedna. Beginner and

            Rather than interpreting planetary influences as "good" or "bad,”
            thereby putting the individual in a box,
            <b><i>The Astrology Guide</i></b> looks at the "gift" and the
            corresponding "shadow" each planet, sign, house placement, and
            planetary combination in the astrology chart offers. The “shadow” is
            a concept first coined by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung that
            describes those aspects of the personality that we choose to reject
            or repress, and embracing the planetary shadow creates personal
            empowerment. The planets are not doing something to you; instead,
            you can learn to interact with them, dance with their energy, and
            exist in harmony with them. This informative guide aids in
            self-discovery and furthers self-empowerment by helping you answer
            questions such as …<i></i>
