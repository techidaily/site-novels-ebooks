          Reveals the historical roots of the symbology of the Tarot in the
          Mithraic tradition of the Persian Magi and the Hermetic tradition
          <br /><br />• Explores the Magian teachings on the
          <i>Stoeicheia</i> and how this magical alphabet was the template for
          the Tarot <br /><br />• Explains how the sequencing of the Major
          Arcana is related to the images used in Mithraic initiation
          <br /><br />• Looks at the original meanings of the Major Arcana using
          Mithraic symbolism, as well as the deep-level connections of the Tarot
          with Egypt, the Romani people, the Semitic tradition, and runes
          <br /><br />The Tarot is a mythic map of the world and of
          consciousness. It offers a meta-language of signs and symbols that
          communicate their meaning precisely. Yet the true origins of the Tarot
          remain shrouded in mystery. These oracular cards have long been
          thought to have come from Egypt or from the “Gypsies,” but as Stephen
          E. Flowers reveals, their original roots lie in the Mithraic tradition
          of the Persian Magi. <br /><br />In this book, Flowers explores the
          historical roots and mythology of the symbolic images that became
          known as the Tarot. Drawing on theories first pioneered by the Swedish
          scholar Sigurd Agrell (1881-1937), he reveals the genesis of the
          Tarot’s symbolism in the great Hermetic tradition at the same time the
          Magical Papyri were being written in Greco-Roman Egypt. He explains
          how the sequencing of the Major Arcana is related to the images used
          in Mithraic initiation, elements of which were then integrated into
          existing Roman and Egyptian traditions. Exploring the Magian teachings
          on the Stoeicheia, an alphabet that acted as a map for understanding
          the order of the cosmos, he demonstrates how this alphabet of magical
          symbols was the template for the Tarot. The author also shows how the
          22 Major Arcana cards were related to the 22 letters of the Roman
          alphabet used for oracular purposes in ancient times. Looking in-depth
          at the principles of Mithraism, the author explains how the Roman form
          of Mithraism, a guiding factor in the early shaping of the Tarot, was
          itself a synthesis of Iranian Magianism, Greek stoicism, Babylonian
          astrology, and Greco-Egyptian Hermeticism. <br /><br />Exploring the
          cards themselves, Flowers then looks at the original meanings of the
          Major Arcana using Mithraic symbolism and its offshoots. He also
          explains the truth behind many of the myths surrounding the Tarot,
          including their deep-level connections with Egypt, the Romani people,
          the Semitic tradition, and runes. By restoring the original mysteria
          to the icons of the Tarot and learning their true origins, we can
          better understand the insight these powerful cards impart in
          divination.

          "This is a serious scholarly treatise tracing the roots of TAROT
          imagery back to the beginnings of recorded history. Flowers gave me
          the thread that connected all the pieces of Western esoteric wisdom I
          have been collecting. He writes directly without the obscure trappings
          of esoteric writings from a century ago. If you know who the players
          are, it suddenly all makes sense."
