            >From Halloween expert Morton, a level-headed and entertaining
            history of our desire and attempts to hold conversations with the
            dead.</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br /><i>Calling the Spirits</i> investigates the eerie
          history of our conversations with the dead, from necromancy in Homer’s
          <i>Odyssey</i> to the emergence of Spiritualism—when Victorians were
          entranced by mediums and the seance was born. Among our cast are the
          Fox sisters, teenagers surrounded by “spirit rappings”; Daniel Dunglas
          Home, the “greatest medium of all time”; Houdini and Sir Arthur Conan
          Doyle, whose unlikely friendship was forged, then riven, by the
          afterlife; and Helen Duncan, the medium whose trial in 1944 for
          witchcraft proved more popular to the public than news about the war.
          The book also considers Ouija boards, modern psychics, and paranormal
          investigations, and is illustrated with engravings, fine art (from
          beyond), and photographs. Hugely entertaining, it begs the question:
          is anybody there . . . ?

          "An impressive piece of research. . . . <i>Calling the Spirits</i> is
          a must-read for anyone fascinated with Spiritualism."— Alma Katsu,
          author of "The Deep" and "The Hunger"<br />"It’s not only fearful
          fiction that is having a moment. With the world full of real-life
          terrors, nonfiction writers are also responding. Informational texts
          about horror have traditionally been limited to local ghost tales or
          explorations of horror in film. Now, authors are entering new
          territory that goes beyond the confines of the genre. Morton, the
          world’s eminent expert on Halloween, has a fascinating new book,
          <i>Calling the Spirits: A History of Seances</i>, a fun and thorough
          look at how humans have tried to communicate with the dead over
          time."— Library Journal<br />"Morton is clearly skeptical of most of
          the claims made for séances and the phenomena of Spiritualism, but
          presents the claims of those involved in an even-handed manner, whilst
          also presenting the voices of those, throughout history, who have
          found no evidence for the reality of any form of postmortem
          communication. The fascinating history of séances is filled with
          mystery, deception, self-deception, genuine belief, scientific
          inquiry, and personal transformation, which is well described in this
          extremely interesting and readable account."— Magonia Review of
          Books<br />"While Victorian obsessions are the meat of&nbsp;<i
            >Calling the Spirits</i
          >, it is bookended by the necromancy of the ancients and modern
          séances. . . . Morton’s book will interest anyone whose ancestors
          claimed psychic powers."— Who Do You Think You Are?<br />"An ambitious
          primer on the history of Spiritualism, . . .&nbsp;<i
            >Calling the Spirits</i
          >&nbsp;is engagingly written, well illustrated, and up-to-date."—
          Journal of the Society for Psychical Research<br />"In
          <i>Calling the Spirits</i>, Morton has provided the immediate turn-to
          book on the subject of mediums and seances."— The Pilgrim<br />"Morton
          tells the story of Spiritualism, writ large, in a highly readable book
          that provides a succinct, though impressively nuanced, summary of an
          otherwise sprawling social movement and religion."— Nova Religio<br />"A
          level-headed and entertaining history of our desire and attempts to
          hold conversations with the dead.
