            given rise to a revival of ancient spiritual traditions and a
            plethora of new movements</b
          ><br /><br />• Reveals the survival of ancient Slavic deities, pagan
          practices, and folk medicine tradition in modern Russia, including the
          indigenous pre-Christian customs of the Mari people and the shamanic
          traditions of Siberia<br /><br />• Examines the precursors to modern
          spiritual movements in the “Silver Age” (1880-1920) and discusses the
          impact of the Russian Revolution on spiritual and esoteric groups<br /><br />•
          Offers a deep look at the controversial Book of Veles, branded by some
          as a forgery and hailed by others as an epic chronicle of the Slavic
          people<br /><br />In this in-depth look at occult and esoteric
          traditions in Russia, Christopher McIntosh explores the currents of
          mysticism, myth, magic, and the spiritual to which the Russian soul
          has always been attuned. The author explains how the search for
          meaning in the post- Soviet era has given rise to a revival of ancient
          spiritual traditions and a plethora of new movements. He examines the
          precursors to these movements in the “Silver Age” (1880-1920) before
          the Revolution, when alternative forms of spirituality were finding
          new life as a reaction to the ongoing climate of violence, revolt, and
          repression. He discusses the impact of the Russian Revolution on
          spiritual and esoteric groups and shows how their activities were
          tolerated and even in some instances encouraged--until Stalin assumed
          power in 1924. <br /><br />Discussing the spiritual reawakening after
          the fall of communism in 1989, the author explores the survival of
          Slavic deities and pagan practices in modern Russia, including the
          indigenous pre-Christian customs of the Mari people and the shamanic
          traditions of Siberia. He examines the resurgence of the Orthodox
          Church and the burgeoning of alternative forms of spirituality. He
          offers a deep look at the controversial Book of Veles, branded by some
          as a forgery and hailed by others as an epic chronicle of the Slavic
          people. He also explores the interface between spirituality and the
          arts and the unique qualities of the Russian language as a medium for
          the sacred. <br /><br />Revealing the implications of the modern
          Russian spiritual and esoteric renaissance, McIntosh shows that it
          still remains to be seen whether Edgar Cayce’s prediction of Russia as
          the hope of the world will come true or if Russia will remain, as
          Churchill famously stated, “a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an
          enigma.”

          “This book of marvels might easily have been called
          <i>The Spirit of Russia</i>, or<i> The Spirit in Russia</i>, for that
          is its true trajectory. Christopher McIntosh wants to show us an
          unknown country with an immensely varied culture based on spiritual
          awareness of God or divine powers in humankind and in the natural
          world that brings us life. We cross the threshold from nature to
          super-nature with remarkable ease with the assistance of the uniquely
          Russian sensibility. It is enormously helpful to see this range of
          knowledge brought to bear with such vivid focus on a single country.
          That country is today one of the most controversial in the world. We
          hear much about Russia--or think we do. What we do <i>not</i> hear,
          and what I fear the prevailing mentality of our dominant news media
          <i>does not want us to hear</i>--you will find beautifully and simply
          expressed in this vital book. If ‘occult’ is taken in its true meaning
          of ‘something hidden,’ this book is indeed about an occulted Russia,
          hidden from the eyes of the West, which has so much to learn from it.
          This is a vital, engaging, always surprising text for anyone who wants
          to understand this massive neighbor of East and West, and who has the
          courage to build on the courage of those who have, against the odds,
          worked and suffered and died to maintain and promote spiritual
          consciousness in Russia. Christopher’s book also shows where
          spirituality can be harnessed to some rather unspiritual objectives.
          We see the beauty, and the warts, but all in all: a must-read.
          <i>Occult Russia</i> is sober, informed, provocative, clear, and
          important.”
