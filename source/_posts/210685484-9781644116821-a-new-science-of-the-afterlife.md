            >Reveals how the continuity of consciousness beyond the physical
            body can be objectively demonstrated</b
          ><br /><br />• Explores 15 promising avenues of post-materialist
          scientific investigation currently underway<br /><br />• Provides a
          succinct account of the experience of transition to the “next life”
          and what one might expect when one arrives there<br /><br />• Explains
          how materialism has prevented us from realizing a deeper understanding
          of the nature of space, time, life, death, and consciousness<br /><br />Sharing
          his more than three decades of research into the afterlife and
          paranormal phenomena, award-winning documentary filmmaker Daniel
          Drasin shows that the continuity of human consciousness beyond the
          physical body and after death constitutes a legitimate area of
          scientific inquiry and that it can be objectively demonstrated.
          <br /><br />Drasin begins by revealing how our belief in
          materialism—through its effects on our social norms, taboos, and even
          language—has deeply constrained our civilization’s understanding of
          the nature of space, time, life, death, and consciousness. However, as
          Drasin explains, our deeply ingrained cultural habits tied to
          materialism have begun to change. He explores 15 promising
          post-materialist scientific investigations currently underway,
          focusing in depth on three examples that offer the most objectively
          irrefutable evidence for the survival of consciousness, including
          electronic audio and visual communications from the other side, the
          groundbreaking five-year Scole Experiment in physical mediumship, and
          the profoundly evidential reincarnation case of James Leininger.
          <br /><br />Looking at how language frames our perceptions about life
          and death, the author presents thought experiments and simple
          exercises to help us see through materialist ideology and perceive a
          broader landscape of reality. He provides a succinct account of the
          experience of transition to the “next life” and explores what the
          afterlife is made of, where it’s located, how it works, and what it’s
          for. <br /><br />Drasin shows how, by thinking and speaking about
          death and the survival of consciousness in new ways, we can facilitate
          a clearer, more relaxed, comfortable, and rational conversation about
          what awaits us all sooner or later on the other side of life.
