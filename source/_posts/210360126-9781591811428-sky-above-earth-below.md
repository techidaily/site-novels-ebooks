          ><br /><br />
          Since the 1940's, meditation master and vision-quest leader John P.
          Milton has led over 10,000 vision quests into the wilds of Colorado,
          the Himalayas, Bali, the Arctic, Mexico, and other powerful sites
          around the world. Now this pathfinder guides readers back to the
          wilderness within themselves, to discover how they are connected to
          the vast and wondrous mystery of nature.<br /><br />
          In <i>Sky Above, Earth Below</i>, Milton shares his Twelve Principles
          of Natural Liberation, then walks readers through the practice of
          relaxation, presence, cultivating universal energy, and more. “Written
          out of boundless reverence for the Earth and life itself, [Milton]
          transfers the wisdom of Taoism into simple terms accessible to all
          readers regardless of personal background” (<i>Midwest Book Review</i
          >).

        </h4>
        <p>
          John P. Milton is a frequent lecturer and workshop leader, and a
          pioneering, renowned, and sought-after meditation and Qi Gong teacher.
          Thousands of people have sought his instruction since he began
          teaching in the 1950's. He has developed unique practices for uniting
          inner and outer nature through training in Buddhist, Taoist, Vedantic,
          Tantric, and Native American traditions, and he incorporates T’ai Chi
          and yoga in his work. Milton is also known for organizing and leading
          dozens of expeditions into some of the wildest areas left on Earth,
          starting in his late teens. He received his M.S. in ecology and
          conservation from the University of Michigan in 1963. A founding
          father of the environmental movement in the early 1960's, he was a
          professor of environmental studies and a Woodrow Wilson Center scholar
          at the Smithsonian Institute. He was one of the first ecologists on
          staff at the White House as a member of the President's Council of
          Economic Advisors, and was a founding member of the environmental
          organization Friends of the Earth. Milton was instrumental in
          introducing the vision quest to contemporary culture. In 1945, at the
          time he began his sacred solo retreats in the wilderness, vision
          quests were unknown in the Americas outside Native American culture.
          For years, this author has written books and articles on inner
          development and ecology. He founded Threshold, a foundation devoted to
          spiritual liberation in nature. His programs inspire Earth stewardship
          by cultivating natural wisdom and an open, loving heart in the wild.
