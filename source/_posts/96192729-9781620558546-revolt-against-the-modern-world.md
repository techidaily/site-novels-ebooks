          With unflinching gaze and uncompromising intensity Julius Evola
          analyzes the spiritual and cultural malaise at the heart of Western
          civilization and all that passes for progress in the modern world. As
          a gadfly, Evola spares no one and nothing in his survey of what we
          have lost and where we are headed. At turns prophetic and provocative,
          <i>Revolt against the Modern World</i> outlines a profound metaphysics
          of history and demonstrates how and why we have lost contact with the
          transcendent dimension of being. <br />
          <br />The revolt advocated by Evola does not resemble the familiar
          protests of either liberals or conservatives. His criticisms are not
          limited to exposing the mindless nature of consumerism, the march of
          progress, the rise of technocracy, or the dominance of unalloyed
          individualism, although these and other subjects come under his
          scrutiny. Rather, he attempts to trace in space and time the remote
          causes and processes that have exercised corrosive influence on what
          he considers to be the higher values, ideals, beliefs, and codes of
          conduct--the world of Tradition--that are at the foundation of Western
          civilization and described in the myths and sacred literature of the
          Indo‑Europeans. Agreeing with the Hindu philosophers that history is
          the movement of huge cycles and that we are now in the Kali Yuga, the
          age of dissolution and decadence, Evola finds revolt to be the only
          logical response for those who oppose the materialism and ritualized
          meaninglessness of life in the twentieth century. <br />
          <br />Through a sweeping study of the structures, myths, beliefs, and
          spiritual traditions of the major Western civilizations, the author
          compares the characteristics of the modern world with those of
          traditional societies. The domains explored include politics, law, the
          rise and fall of empires, the history of the Church, the doctrine of
          the two natures, life and death, social institutions and the caste
          system, the limits of racial theories, capitalism and communism,
          relations between the sexes, and the meaning of warriorhood. At every
          turn Evola challenges the reader’s most cherished assumptions about
          fundamental aspects of modern life. <br />
          <br />A controversial scholar, philosopher, and social thinker, JULIUS
          EVOLA (1898-1974) has only recently become known to more than a
          handful of English‑speaking readers. An authority on the world’s
          esoteric traditions, Evola wrote extensively on ancient civilizations
          and the world of Tradition in both East and West. Other books by Evola
          published by Inner Traditions include
          <i>Eros and the Mysteries of Love</i>, <i>The Yoga of Power</i>,
          <i>The Hermetic Tradition</i>, and <i>The Doctrine of Awakening</i>.
