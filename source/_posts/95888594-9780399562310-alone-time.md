            >"In Paris (or anywhere else, really) a table for one can be a most
            delightful place." --<i>Alone Time</i>, as seen in

          ><br /><b></b><br /><b
            >A wise, passionate account of the pleasures of traveling solo</b
          ><br /><br />In our increasingly frantic daily lives, many people are
          genuinely fearful of the prospect of solitude, but time alone can be
          both rich and restorative, especially when travelling. Through
          on-the-ground reporting and recounting the experiences of artists,
          writers, and innovators who cherished solitude, Stephanie Rosenbloom
          considers how being alone as a traveller--and even in one's own
          city--is conducive to becoming acutely aware of the sensual details of
          the world--patterns, textures, colors, tastes, sounds--in ways that
          are difficult to do in the company of others.<br /><br /><i
            >Alone Time</i
          >
          is divided into four parts, each set in a different city, in a
          different season, in a single year. The destinations--Paris, Istanbul,
          Florence, New York--are all pedestrian-friendly, allowing travelers to
          slow down and appreciate casual pleasures instead of hurtling through
          museums and posting photos to Instagram. Each section spotlights a
          different theme associated with the joys and benefits of time alone
          and how it can enable people to enrich their lives--facilitating
          creativity, learning, self-reliance, as well as the ability to
          experiment and change. Rosenbloom incorporates insights from
          psychologists and sociologists who have studied solitude and
          happiness, and explores such topics as dining alone, learning to
          savor, discovering interests and passions, and finding or creating
          silent spaces. Her engaging and elegant prose makes
          <i>Alone Time</i> as warmly intimate an account as the details of a
          trip shared by a beloved friend--and will have its many readers eager
          to set off on their own solo adventures.

          "[An] evocative, observant new book."<br />—<b><i>Time</i></b
          ><br /><br />"In a society that increasingly values connectivity,
          moments of solitude are hard to come by . . . In <i>Alone Time</i>,
          Stephanie Rosenbloom reflects on her solo trips to Paris, Florence,
          Istanbul, and New York and offers even the most social of social
          butterflies strategies to reap the benefits of being alone."<br />—<b

          in your own city, and to stay logged out while you explore."<br />—<b
            ><i>Bustle&nbsp;</i></b
          ><br /><br />"[Rosenbloom's] enthusiasm and eagerness are like that of
          a friend warmly reliving their favorite moments from a recent
          life-changing trip. And her happiness with her serendipitous
          discoveries along the way is infectious."<br />—<b
            ><i>Popmatters</i></b
          ><br /><br />"Rosenbloom offers a leisurely look at the simple
          treasures waiting to be uncovered by the solo traveler . . . She also
          unpacks research on the benefits to approaching the world with a
          willingness to try something new, and a commitment to staying in the
          present moment. The combination makes for a richly rewarding guide for
          any explorer, whether of distant lands or one's own backyard."<br />—<b
            ><i>Booklist</i></b
          ><br /><br />"<i>Alone Time</i> is both a paean to its title and an
          invitation to anyone who has ever longed to explore a new city&nbsp;<i
            >á seul</i
          >."<br />—<i><b>Shelf Awareness</b><br /></i><br />"A joyous, erudite
          new book that is sure to delight both travelers and armchair
          travelers, <i>Alone Time</i>&nbsp;is a shapeshifter. Much of it is an
          elegant and insightful travel memoir . . . but what gives the book its
          heft and intellectual grounding is the way Rosenbloom is able to use
          her own experiences as a jumping off point for discussions of the
          latest psychological and sociological studies into the nature of
          happiness. . . . It's a deeply satisfying mix for the reader, part
          travel guide, part guide to living."<br />—<b
