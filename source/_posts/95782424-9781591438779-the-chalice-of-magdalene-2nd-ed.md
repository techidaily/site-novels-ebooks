          Reveals the discovery of an artifact that many experts believe may be
          the Holy Grail <br /><br />• Traces the journey of the Grail from the
          Holy Land to Rome and eventually to a ruined chapel in Shropshire,
          England <br /><br />• Uncovers new evidence identifying the historical
          King Arthur and his connection to the Holy Grail <br /><br />The
          popular Arthurian stories of the Middle Ages depict the Holy Grail as
          Christ’s cup from the Last Supper, which was believed to have been
          endowed with miraculous healing powers and the ability to give eternal
          life to whoever drank from it. A much earlier tradition, however,
          claimed the Grail was the vessel used by Mary Magdalene to collect
          Christ’s blood when he appeared to her after rising from the tomb.
          While many vessels were claimed to have been the true Grail, there was
          only one thought to have been the chalice used by Mary. From Jesus’
          empty tomb, where it remained for almost 400 years, this holy relic
          known as the Marian Chalice was taken to Rome by the mother of the
          first Christian emperor, Constantine the Great. It was then smuggled
          from Rome in 410 A.D., according to the fifth-century historian
          Olympiodorus, to save it from the barbarians who sacked the city. Well
          into the Middle Ages legend persisted that it had been taken to safety
          in Britain, the last outpost of Roman civilization in Western
          Europe.<br /><br />This journey to England, and what happened to the
          Chalice there, is the focus of this book. Graham Phillips’s research
          uncovers the secret legacy of an ancient noble family over generations
          and a trail of clues hidden in the English countryside that lead to a
          mysterious grotto, a forgotten attic, and the lost chalice. In tracing
          the relic, Phillips offers the inside story behind an astonishing
          adventure that results in the identification of the historical King
          Arthur and the location of one of the most powerful symbols in Western
          tradition.
