          look at how we can better understand and improve our relationship both
          with ourselves and others. It ‘flows’ flawlessly.”

          “…a very introspective, compassionate, and thought-provoking read.
          There are many self-help books out there, but this one felt as if
          Katherine was personally guiding me through a journey with a
          genuineness that comes from an individual who is full of grace,
          humbleness, and love.”

          “I liked the format and structure of River to Ocean, with the concept,
          practices, and stories from the field. I found the personal stories,
          in particular, very honest, vulnerable, and relatable – in a way that
          connected me to Katherine and invited me to be honest and vulnerable
          in my own self-reflection. Katherine’s book has the voice of someone
          who has done the work and has reflected deeply on what she is speaking
          about.”

          work. Katherine’s transparency on the subject cemented it. She knows

          greatly appreciate the depth and breadth of this work and Katherine’s
          deep care and intention in writing it. This book will be deeply
