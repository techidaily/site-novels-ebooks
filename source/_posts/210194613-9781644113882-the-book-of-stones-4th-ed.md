          • Explores 455 crystals, minerals, gemstones, and their metaphysical
          energies, including vivid color photographs for each stone
          <br /><br />• For each stone, shares its scientific information, its
          element and chakra correspondences, its history, and its physical,
          emotional, and spiritual benefits <br /><br />• Includes guidance on
          how to work with crystals and stones and also explores the concept of
          crystal resonance <br /><br />Offering an illuminating alphabetical
          journey through the mineral kingdom, this comprehensive reference
          guide takes you deep into the world of crystals and their uses for
          spiritual awakening and self-healing. Exploring 455 gemstones and
          their metaphysical energies, the encyclopedia includes vivid color
          photographs for each stone to aid identification and showcase its
          beauty, as well as listing each gem’s physical, emotional, and
          spiritual benefits. <br /><br />The book begins with two introductory
          chapters by authors Naisha Ahsian and Robert Simmons detailing how to
          work with crystals and stones and exploring the concept of crystal
          resonance. Each stone entry includes the mineral name and photo, its
          elemental and chakra correspondences, keywords that indicate its
          properties, and a description of the crystal structure, hardness,
          history, and known locations of each mineral, plus any relevant legend
          or lore from the past. Each author then offers personal insights on
          the subtle energy properties and spiritual applications of the stone.
          The entries conclude with the spiritual, emotional, and physical
          healing qualities of the stone and an affirmation for evoking its
          potential benefits. This edition also includes an index of the stones’
          healing and energetic properties, making it easy to find the stone
          best suited to your needs.

          “In this time of social fragmentation and isolation, many of us who
          work to reclaim remembrance and participation in the living world
          lament the scarcity of elders and initiators to guide our efforts. As
          if in answer to our need,<i> The Book of Stones</i> carries us outside
          the human world to a gathering of wise elders. Here the stone people
          speak to us, in many voices, of forgotten stories and unknown wisdoms
          that will sustain us on the path of soul.”
