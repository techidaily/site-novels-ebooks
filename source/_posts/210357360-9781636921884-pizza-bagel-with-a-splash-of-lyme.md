          Growing up in suburban Northern New Jersey, on the border of New York
          City, Stacey spent a lot of time outside. Day camp, sleep-a-way camp,
          playing in the woods, being carefree with nature was normal in her
          childhood. Fast-forward to February 28, 2001. She moved to Florida to
          a different outside world. Stacey went camping in 2013, and her life
          changed forever. The ever-changing symptoms from a tick bite almost
          cost her life. Stacey was homebound and unable to work. Traditional
          doctors were baffled, with no diagnosis in sight. The approach she
          took is something anyone with an illness, disease, or diagnosis could
          benefit from and most definitely save your life, or someone you
          know.Stacey is a fighter, taught in her early years to never quit.
          With whatever she had left in her, basically on her deathbed, was used
          for research and journaling for her sanity. She didnâ€™t realize that
          she was writing a book of self-discovery, self-diagnosis and going
          head-to-head with traditional medicine to save her life.
          Natural/integrative, Eastern/Western medicine was the lifesaving
          answer. This has allowed her to manage her symptoms as she was
          diagnosed too late. Living a healthy, happy, active life now while
          helping others think outside the box. Through this journey, Stacey
          felt a passion and purpose to help others. After her own journey of
          self-discovery, Skin Deep with Stacey was created from a Lyme disease
          warrior mindset and 20-plus years of experience as a licensed
          esthetician. Your skin is the largest living organ of the body and
          everything comes out through your skin. Most people do not pay
          attention to early signs and symptoms that are the beginning of
          deep-rooted issues. Today is the first day of the rest of your life
          and it is not a dress rehearsal.
