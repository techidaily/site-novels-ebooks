            >Bestselling author Erich von Däniken delves into the mysteries of

            Includes a Foreword by Giorgio Tsoukalos.</b
          ><br /><br />High up in the Bolivian Andes-4,000 meters above sea
          level-lies Puma punku, an ancient ruined city that simply could never
          have been constructed by its Stone Age inhabitants. "Something here
          really stinks to high heaven," writes Erich von Daniken.<br /><br />"In
          <i>Twilight of the Gods</i>," says von Daniken, "I document precisely
          what it was that left the first visitors breathless as they stood
          before the mighty stone blocks some 400 years ago. I will show you
          what archeologists discovered hundreds of years ago and demonstrate
          how much has been destroyed over the centuries. Intentionally.<br /><br />"I
          will also prove that Puma punku was not built by any Stone Age
          people.<br /><br />"And in December 2012, the gods will return from
          their long journey and appear again here on Earth. At least that is
          what the Mayan calendar would have us believe.<br /><br />"The
          so-called gods—the extraterrestrials—will come again. We're headed for
          a 'god shock' of major proportions.<br /><br />"But doesn't anyone
          with half a brain know that interstellar travel is simply impossible
          because of the sheer distances involved? And that extraterrestrials
          would never look like us?<br /><br />"Well, dear readers, I destroy
          these preconceptions. Systematically. One bit at a time."<br /><br />In
          his own inimitable way, Erich von Daniken picks these preconceptions
          and prejudices apart with a clarity no other author could manage.

          Erich von Däniken is arguably the most widely read and most-copied
          nonfiction author in the world. He published his first (and
          best-known) book, Chariots of the Gods, in 1968. The worldwide best
          seller was followed by 40 more books, including the recent best
          sellers Twilight of the Gods, History Is Wrong, Evidence of the Gods,
          Remnants of the Gods, and Odyssey of the Gods (all published by New
          Page Books). His works have been translated into 28 languages and have
          sold more than 65 million copies. Several have also been made into
          films. Von Däniken's ideas have been the inspiration for a wide range
          of television series, including the History Channel's hit Ancient
          Aliens. His research organization, the A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com
          (Archaeology, Astronautics,&nbsp;SETI Research Association), comprises
          laymen and academics from all walks of life. Internationally, there
          are about 10,000 members. He lives in Switzerland but is an
          ever-present figure on the international lecture circuit, traveling
          more than 100,000 miles a year.
