          <p>
            My mother made sure that all of us were in church on Sunday and that
            we went to all the Revivals and to vacation Bible schools every
            summer, and after I was married, I continued that practice with my
            family.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In the '50sâ€“'60s and part of the '70s, all churches were always full
            with people, sometimes having to stand up in the back. But then near
            the end of the '70s, I noticed a decline in church attendance and
            fewer people were being baptized, and this has continued to be a
            trend today. I noticed this, and I'm sure others have also, and yet
            nothing was done.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I decided to start writing down my ideas about this several years
            ago, and I kept them in a notebook. After I retired, I had more
            time, so I decided to put together a plan to not only stop this but
            also to turn it around; and long before I wrote this book, I put
            this plan into action. The first church had between fifty and sixty
            people when this started, and in just about three years, this church
            had grown to almost three hundred members. So I tried it again with
            another church in another state, and basically the same thing
            happened.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            So being retired, I decided to put this plan together in a book that
            has taken me almost ten years to implement and write. It does work;
            however, you just can't wish it to happen. It takes work and work
            from everyone, but if we are to follow Christ's commandments, it
            should be a work that is enjoyable and a blessing both for you and
            to the souls you win, and the blessings will continue as you watch
            your church grow.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>May God bless you in your endeavor. Don't give up.</p>
