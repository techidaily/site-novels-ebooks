              >Imagine a world where everything is connected, where people work
              together for the mutual benefit of all living things. Imagine a
              world full of abundance, love, and prosperity, not driven by
              scarcity and fear. This is the world of Ayni (AY-Nee), and the
              people of the Andes have lived this way for hundreds of
              years.</span

              >Join Erin Lucero on her personal journey to inter-connectedness.
              Following the teachings of yoga and shamanism, she shed the fears
              and false stories in her own life and found love, balance, and
              harmony within herself and with the world. She offers her journey,
              along with several practical exercises, as a roadmap and
              invitation to find love and harmony in your own life. Through her
              own inner journey, Erin shows that we are all connected, that the
              world is full of love, and that we can be a part of making it a
              better place for all living things.</span

              >AYNI is a Quechua word that means "Today for you, tomorrow for
              me." It is a way of life that is based on giving, and an
              understanding that when you are in need the universe will provide.
              This idea is the foundation for this book and for an entire way of
              life, one that frees itself from the patriarchy and the
              destructive patterns of colonialism.</span

              >Erin explores this concept through the teachings of yoga and
              shamanism. The Yoga teachings are based on her lineage passed down
              from Swami Satyananda Saraswati and the ancient yoga texts. The
              Shamanic teachings are based on the Four Winds Medicine Wheel as
              developed by Alberto Villoldo, Ph.D, and Erin's journey around
              this wheel as a student at the Four Winds Institute. The Four
              Winds teaches shamanism based on the teachings of the Q'ero
              Shamans of Peru. It combines ancient wisdom and traditions with
              modern science.</span

              >The ancient sages and mystics knew and understood the
              mind-body-spirit connection in a profound way, and we can look to
              their ancient wisdom to uncover these long-forgotten secrets. Erin
              shares this wisdom and how she incorporates it into her own life.
              She offers simple yet powerful practices that you can try at home.
              She shows you how to listen to your inner intuition, how to find
              relaxation and grounding, and how to transform your fears into
              powerful strengths. She shows that the world can be full of hope
              and healing. She believes that we all have more power than we
              realize and that each of us can use that power to make the world a
              better place for all living things.</span
