          Join Wendy on her inspirational journey as she seeks healing from the
          effects of her childhood diabetes. This is an inspiring story about
          miracles and the rekindling of hope.... Wendy spent much of her life
          looking for answers to the health issues caused by childhood diabetes,
          and because of this she discovered a wealth of knowledge in this area.
          She consistently recovered from health issues in ways that both
          confounded and inspired the medical community. o After a major stroke,
          the medical community thought she would never speak again. But she
          went on to speak, write, walk, and live with passion and joy. o With
          gangrene, things did not look good for her foot....but she found ways
          to heal and continue. o With kidney failure, dietary factors played a
          significant role, but it was through a successful balance of thought,
          exercise, and happiness, that she was able to survive 19 years on
          dialysis. Wendy is living proof that anything is possible with Love,
          Determination, and Faith. By focusing mind, body, and spirit, she
          rediscovered the meaning of wellness. This is a story based on Wendy's
          life. Names have been changed in order to protect identities, but the
          story itself is truth. The process of writing this book took more than
          twenty-two years to unfold. The author hopes that this book will show
          you how to fill your days with magic and
          laughter.================================================== She
          Believes in Magic by Dr. Andre Pickersgill,
          MD================================================== I have known
          Wendy for over ten years, as a doctor and as a friend. When modern
          medicine had little to offer her, she showed courage and strength
          beyond expectation. She achieved significant, verifiable improvements
          in her medical condition through diet, supplements, and faith. She has
          taught me much about respecting patient autonomy, and I have learned
          to expand my reality, and experience life more fully. Reading this
          book has provided a fascinating glimpse of the spirit inside this
          person dealing with more than her share of challenges. Revealed are
          the pain, despair, love and joy which make Wendy more real than most
          people I know. And the best part is...she believes in magic.
          =========================================================== Keep
          Reaching for Dreams by Dr. Alastair Pirie Chiropractor,
          Cosmoneurobiologist
          ===========================================================It has been
          said, that courage is a special kind of knowledge, not the absence of
          fear, but rather the realization that something else is more important
          than fear. It can never be an easy task to keep reaching for dreams.
          Strength and courage can sometimes be lonely friends, but those who
          can reach, walk in stardust. Wendy is just such a being. In this
          difficult age we are experiencing on Earth, Wendy inspires us to
          broaden our horizons, to move out of our narrow reality tunnels and to
          embrace a model of life that is permeated by intelligence and wisdom
          far removed from the local and mundane. "A Quest for Healing, A Story
          of Love," is a remarkable piece of writing revealed to us from the
          heart and soul of an equally remarkable woman. Wendy's journey has
          been and will continue to be a source of tremendous insight for me
          personally as I too continue to try to contemplate and understand the
          intricacies of the mind-body system. Thank you Wendy!!!!!

          Wendy's unique quest for knowledge and answers transcends what most
          people believe is possible. Throughout the years, Wendy's perspective
          on life and health continue to inspire me while challenging many of my
          long held beliefs.She lives life as an art as she lives in hope and
          embraces the potential for self-healing. One of her most frequent
          lessons to me is that laughter in the face of great adversity is a
          very powerful thing. Keep smiling Wendy; you are a very special
          person.
