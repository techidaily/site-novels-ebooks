            ><br />In 20 short, gem-like chapters, meditation teacher Tracy
            Cochran invites us to explore living fully in the present moment as
            a revolutionary practice.<br /><br />Tracy’s vibrant essays from her
            storied life give plenty of encouragement to reframe and dive deep
            into our own experiences.</b
          ><br /><br />Mindfulness offers us a way to be fully in the present
          moment—and as we start to embrace this practice, we learn that our
          lives are made of present moments. That gift of presence is the
          palpable experience of awareness that appears when we remember to be
          mindful of those moments.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><b></b><br />In 20 short
          chapters, Cochran encourages us to see presence as a living force—and
          to recognize and explore how that shows up in our lives. She offers
          riveting and relatable stories from her life—a spiritually
          transformative wine-making trip in France, a near-death experience
          while being mugged, managing her feisty child while on a retreat with
          Thich Nhat Hanh, among many others—and Buddhist teachings to encourage
          us to see the power of presence to illuminate and transform our past,
          present, and future.&nbsp;<br /><b></b><br />Cochran's observations
          and reminiscences are wise and pithy, and she gives us plenty of
          encouragement to explore and reframe our own experiences.

          “This is a wonderful, wise, and tender book. Its elegant and gifted
          storytelling will change you—softening your heart, opening you to the
          gifts and beauty around you, bringing you into a presence that we so
          need in this fast-paced world.”<br />—<b>Jack Kornfield</b>, author of
          <i>A Path with Heart</i><br /><br />“Tracy Cochran awakens us to
          life’s moment-by-moment wonder, and to the teachings that come from
          what is both ordinary and extraordinary. She guides us to being fully
          present in our experience, reconnecting us to the deeper roots that
          can sustain us in our broken world.”<br />—<b>Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee</b
          >, Sufi teacher and author of <i>Spiritual Ecology</i
          ><br /><br />“Tracy Cochran is a clear, wholehearted, and humble guide
          who helps us find our way home. I am moved by the warmth of Tracy’s
          clarity and how she uses the authenticity of her own experience to
          uncover the archetypal thresholds we all face—as well as the
          constellations of association and metaphor that her deep reflection
          brings to the surface.”<br />—<b>Mark Nepo</b>, author of
          <i>The Half-Life of Angels</i><br /><br />“Every essay in this
          thoughtful and lyrical collection is a gem shining with deeply
          sensitive insights and reflections. From multiple angles, these essays
          show us how presence—close and clear attention to the realities of our
          lives—can open doors to wisdom and turn the humblest of events into
          revelations of beauty and goodness. Even danger and disappointment,
          Cochran demonstrates, can connect us to previously untouched
          dimensions of meaning.”<br />—<b>Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi</b>, Buddhist
          scholar and translator<br /><br />“<i>Presence</i> takes us on a
          delightful journey brimming with stories, wisdom, practices, and
          possibility. As Tracy Cochran draws from the well of her own life
          experience, she offers us a mirror into our own, inviting us to shed
          the myriad ways we create separateness and drop open to the authentic
          experience of being human. Wonderfully wise, gently compassionate,
          <i>Presence</i> shines as a beacon in our troubled world.”<br />—<b
