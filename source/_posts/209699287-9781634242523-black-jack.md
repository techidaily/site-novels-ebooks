          It's been a long time coming, and it's right around the corner... As
          author S.K. Bain detailed in The Most Dangerous Book in the World:
          9/11 as Mass Ritual, the events of September 11th, 2001, constituted a
          global occult ceremony. But that was mere child's play compared to
          what he's uncovered since. If 9/11 was a MegaRitual, this is a
          GigaRitual, or TeraRitual even. Its scope and scale are truly
          difficult to grasp.***If you thought that 2012 was the end of Galactic
          Alignment, think again. However, this book doesn't propose some new
          date for the made-up Mayan Doomsday, far from it. We are on the cusp
          of a once-in-a-26,000-year event, one that, in astrological terms,
          knows no equal. Do not think for one moment that the masters of our
          world will let it pass unmarked.Black Jack reveals the true date of
          the End of the Great Age, the Mother of All Auspicious Occasions, a
          date that the Cryptocracy has been fixated on—and feverishly preparing
          for—over the past two centuries, and well before. It will almost
          assuredly bring a ritualistic celebration like none other ever
          witnessed, involving mass human sacrifice and the biggest fireworks
          show in history.***The world approaches the dawning of a new Grand
          Cycle, which the elite will inaugurate as the New Great Age of Satan.
          As we draw near, ask yourself this question: if you were among the
          ranks of these precious few ultra-powerful, would you spare any
          expense or effort to properly commemorate this unique occasion, or to
          fittingly dedicate it to your Dark Lord? Of course you wouldn't.And,
          as a member of the Cryptocracy, you would be so bold and fearless as
          to announce your intentions to the entire world, far in advance. You
          would provide all the useless eaters with the obligatory fair warning,
          mockingly giving notice in plain sight in the most powerful city in
          the world. You would encode The End of the Old World Order in the
          streets of Washington, D.C., which, as is revealed in these pages, is
          nothing less than a Gigantic Black Magickal Spellcasting
          Machine.Furthermore, you would embed the ‘date of demise' in the
          modern calendar, as plain as day for those with eyes to see. You would
          orchestrate a string of foreshadowing, preparatory lesser false-flag
          attacks / mass rituals in the decades leading up to the grand
          occasion, rituals involving, for instance, consecrated sacrificial
          vessels such as—as was the case on 9/11—commercial airliners filled
          with dozens of innocent victims.Your elite family is among those who
          have instigated world wars and induced global famines. You think
          nothing of the use of false-flag terrorism to achieve your goals and
          objectives—even nuclear false-flag terrorism.***One doesn't have to be
          a religious fundamentalist to sense it, or see it all around us—the
          Satanification of the World. Practically every public event is now a
          thinly-veiled, if at all, Satanic ritual. We are being driven hard
          towards something in the near future, something whose hideous form
          becomes clearer by the day. All the while, the grip of the global
          dark-occult technofascist dictatorship grows ever tighter.Preparations
          have been underway for a very long time, even from the Founding of
          America, and the hour grows late. With bated breath, the entire
          planet, knowingly or unknowingly, awaits the arrival of Black Jack.
