            writing</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains how the 10 <i>sefirot</i>—the channels of
          divine creative life force—can be used to develop writing and give you
          the power to grow as a person and a writer<br /><br />• Explores each
          <i>sefira</i> in detail and how it can be used to manifest creative

          spiritual tradition known as the Kabbalah can be applied to the art of
          writing, award-winning author Sherri Mandell presents a mystical
          system for developing creativity and harnessing divine inspiration in
          your storytelling and other written works. <br /><br />Sharing insight
          from her own spiritual journey and her years of teaching writing,
          Mandell explains how the characteristics of the 10 sefirot—the
          channels of divine creative life force that make up the elemental
          spiritual structure of the world—can be used to think about and
          develop writing in a profound way and give you the power to grow as a
          person and a writer. She explores each sefira in detail and how it can
          be used to manifest creative visions through words. Showing how
          writing can be healing and redemptive, she provides writing exercises
          and imaginative techniques to help you create a writing practice that
          allows you to appreciate the richness of life, retrieve its divine
          beauty, and share your unique wisdom. <br /><br />By unveiling how
          writing can become a spiritual path, a pilgrimage to discover the
          sacred stories within, Mandell shows that sharing your inner truth and
          expressing your personal gifts of imagination through writing is part
          of your individual spiritual mission as well as an essential part of
          the spiritual evolution of the world.
