            <strong>You were born with a destiny.</strong>&nbsp;Do you know
            yours? Are you fulfilling it, or have unexpected tragedy, heartache,
            and obstacles stood in your way? In a world full of divorce,
            addiction, health issues, abuse, financial struggle, and loss of all
            kinds, it seems nearly impossible to find your purpose and become
            who you were born to be. In her book, Becoming Whole, Heather Falter
            guides you through what it takes to get back up after such
            tragedies.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Heather was an artist first. She wrote this book based on her
            painting&nbsp;Wings.&nbsp;The painting of a girl holding her broken
            wing was a piece of art scribbled into her journal and never
            intended to be shared with anyone. It was a lonely night's attempt
            at getting out a feeling that had been eluding her for years. As she
            painted she realized that through unexpected tragedy, and the
            pressures of life, she had lost parts of herself that she
            desperately wanted back. She felt lost and broken, and she wasn't
            sure where to go from there. On the back of her nearly-dry painting
            that night, she scribbled these words:
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            "I'm not sure how my wings got this way. I'm not sure how or when
            they broke. It was slow and something of subtlety... My wings were
            as colorful as they come. Out of my own fear, I've let them fall and
            turn gray. I've hidden myself. I've tried to be something that
            others will be pleased with, and in doing so, I've only found
            displeasure with myself. This image is me promising myself
            something... That I will pick up my wings and let them teach me to
            fly. Please, my loving God, let them fly."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This book takes you back to the beginning and shows how piece by
            broken piece she found the girl she once lost. Her story is not only
            hers-It is all of ours. It is the journey of feeling broken and
            putting yourself back together again. It is enduring heartache and
            trauma of all kinds and overcoming them all, becoming stronger than
            before. In this book, Heather will help you find all of your broken
            pieces, pick each one up, and nurse them back to joyful health. It
            is a roadmap to grief, forgiveness, acceptance, self-discovery,
            hope, healing, and love.
