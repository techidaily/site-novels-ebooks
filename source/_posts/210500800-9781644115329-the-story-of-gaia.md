            >Explores how the Universe, our planet, ourselves, and everything in
            existence has inherent meaning and evolutionary purpose</b
          ><br /><br />• 2023 Nautilus Gold Award<br /><br />• Examines our
          emergence as self-aware members of a Universe that is itself a unified
          and innately sentient entity that exists TO evolve<br /><br />• Shares
          leading-edge scientific breakthroughs and shows how they support
          traditional visions of Earth as a living being--Gaia<br /><br />•
          Rewrites evolution as not driven by random occurrences and mutations
          but by intelligently informed and meaningful information flows and
          processes<br /><br />Exploring our emergence as self-aware members of
          a planetary home and entire Universe that is a unified and innately
          sentient entity, Jude Currivan, Ph.D., shows that mind and
          consciousness are not what we possess but what we and the whole world
          fundamentally are. She reveals our Universe as “a great thought of
          cosmic mind,” manifesting as a cosmic hologram of meaningful
          in-formation that, vitally, exists to evolve. <br /><br />Sharing
          scientific breakthroughs, the author details the 13.8 billion-year
          story of our Universe and Gaia, where everything in existence has
          inherent meaning and evolutionary purpose. Showing how the Universe
          was born, not in an implicitly chaotic big bang, but as the first
          moment of a fine-tuned and ongoing “big breath,” she shares the latest
          evidence for the innate sentience that has guided our universal
          journey from simplicity to ever-greater complexity, diversity, and
          self-awareness--from protons to planets, plants, and people. She
          explains how evolution is not driven by random occurrences and
          mutations but by profoundly resonant and harmonic interplays of forces
          and influences, each intelligently informed and guided.<br /><br />In
          Gaia, the Universe’s evolutionary impulse is embodied in collaborative
          relationships and dynamic co-evolutionary partnerships on a planetary
          scale and as a wholistic gaiasphere. She reveals how the conscious
          evolution of humanity is an integral part of Gaia’s own evolutionary
          progress and purpose. By perceiving and experiencing our planet as a
          sentient being and ourselves as Gaians, we open ourselves to a deeply
          ecological, evolutionary, and, above all, hopeful worldview.

          “A breathtaking journey into the ever-increasing intelligence,
          ingenuity, and creative wisdom of our Universe and the
          consciousness-actualizing ways in which this becomes manifest and
          expressed through Gaia and her children and our creative
          relationships. I highly recommend this masterpiece for discovering the
          principles, processes, and cosmological architecture that makes life
          possible and able to thrive.”
