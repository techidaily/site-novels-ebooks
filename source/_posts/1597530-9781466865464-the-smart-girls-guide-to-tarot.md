            HEY! SMART GIRL! YES, YOU! Are you tired of vague, new agey
            fortune-telling? Readings that say, maybe you'll meet Prince
            Charming or maybe you'll get a dog? Do you want to know the future
            without checking your third eye or contacting your inner goddess?
            <br />Then you need
            <i>The Smart Girl's Guide to Tarot</i>!<br /><br />Every tarot tells
            a story. This book will tell the modern user how to read that story,
            using language and examples relevant to contemporary life. Tarot can
            provide a glimpse into the future and help to clarify one's choices.
            Just like therapy, but a lot cheaper.
            <i>The Smart Girl's Guide to Tarot</i> provides a sharp, funny,
            fresh update of those old, stuffy, mystical tarot guides, unmuddling
            the meaning of the tarot for the general reader, and making readings
            more fun, diverting, and accurate.<br /><br /><i
              >The Smart Girl's Guide</i
            >
            not only clarifies the archaic meanings of the cards, but it
            instructs the modern reader in how to interpret them, allowing her
            to be her own mystic--- because, let's face it, who knows your
            twisted psyche better than you?

          “You'll only manage to put down this stimulating guide to the Tarot
          long enough to purchase or unearth a deck of cards---with which you'll
          be doing readings right away. But be warned, consulting the cards with
          The Smart Girl's Guide to Tarot is a lot like opening a box of Belgian
          chocolates: once you start it's really hard to stop.” —Susi Rajah,
          author of How to Spot a Bastard by His Star Sign<br /><br />“While
          having the cards read by a gypsy crone is atmospheric, you can bet the
          fifteen bucks you just forked over to Madame Zorah that her reading
          will not be terribly trustworthy. Emmi Fredericks shows you how to do
          everything yourself---from asking good questions to interpreting the
          cards correctly.” —Thomas J. Craughwell, author of The Cat in the
          Dryer and 222 Other Urban Legends
