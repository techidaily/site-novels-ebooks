          Mindahi Bastida is a uniquely gifted ceremonial and thought leader
          from a rich cultural tradition. In this extraordinary piece of work,
          he frames a diverse collection of reflections on mystical experiences
          with his own powerful truths. ANCESTORS is more than a book-it is a
          multi-dimensional experience with the capacity to expand both minds
          and hearts. -<strong>Karenna Gore</strong>, founder and executive
          director of the Center for Earth Ethics
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          This book is a gift to its readers: an evocative guide to
          understanding the consciousness behind Indigenous focus on ceremonies,
          sacred sites, ancestors, prayers, offerings, and other expressions of
          human relationship with Mother Earth. Clearly written, ANCESTORS brims
          over with its author's respect for all life. Readers will be inspired
          and begin to feel connected just reading how Mindahi and his
          Otomi-Toltec People have interwoven themselves with the natural world.
          The many anecdotes from individuals whose hearts have been touched by
          occult moments contribute to the sense of wonderful mystery that
          pervades ANCESTORS. -<strong>John Briggs</strong>, distinguished
          professor and author of Fire in the Crucible and Fractals: The
          Patterns of Chaos

        <p>
          In ANCESTORS, Dr. Mindahi Bastida lays out a pathway of universal
          remembrance open to all, harmonizing the insights of his own deep
          spiritual lineage with other wisdom traditions and with emerging
          scientific understandings. It is a profound work, building on his many
          decades of academic research and experiences of sacred sites all over
          the world and includes contributions from some of the greatest
          spiritual thinkers alive today. I would encourage anyone who is
          sincerely seeking the path of remembrance to read this wonderful book.
