              >Have you ever hated what you looked like in the mirror? Have you
              ever wished you weren't born? What about having an addiction that
              kept you up all night until you satisfied it's craving? Ever been
              angry with God? Ever walked away from your faith or attempted
              suicide? Well, if you haven't,&nbsp;I have. I suffered from low
              self-esteem,&nbsp;suicidal thoughts and even rejected my faith in
              God.But guess what??? God didn't give up on me as easily.&nbsp;He
              brought me back to Himself and a proper view of myself.&nbsp;If
              God can do it for me He can do it for anyone. Within these pages
              lies freedom and restoration for those who feel
              hopelessness,&nbsp;lost, lonely,&nbsp;forgotten and without
              purpose and direction . God still has a plan for you and this book
              will confirm it.</span

              have seen him around town, followed his ministry, and interacted
              with him on a couple of occasions. He is a thought-provoking
              person, in full command of his purpose and guided by strong
              Christian principles. Prior to reading this book, I was completely
              unaware of his backstory. This book gripped me.</span

              reminder that God will meet us wherever we are! Thank you, Mr.
              Thurston, for your boldness in being so open about your
              experiences. Not only were you open on your story, but you ended
              your book with the word of God and provided great wisdom to help
              those who may be in the middle of their struggle! Mental illness
              is something that our community is scared to speak on. We sweep it
              under the rug, or ignore the signs.. I'm so glad this young man
              was open enough to start the dialogue! Great read!</span

              >I just want to thank Antoine Thurston for writing such a touching
              book! The best thing about this book is that it was transparent
              and real life! The book My Bondage &amp; My Freedom resonated with
              me on so many levels that I had a spiritual moment during my
              reading! It actually put me in touch with some feelings I thought
              I had dealt with and overcame but obviously not.. (I Cried) (I
              Praised). I can also say that it made me revisit those feelings
              and areas of my life. I was truly set free from some things during
              my reading. I'm grateful I had the opportunity to read this
              book!</span

              >The book is phenomenal. Dr. Thurston presented his vulnerability
              allowing the forum to be set for others especially in the African
              American to come forth with the need to discuss spiritual and
              mental health maintenance. This book will break yolks of bandage
              and let others know that they are not alone, not all is lost, and
              there is a savior that can lead them to freedom. Its a wonderful
              read so wonderful I had to read it again. Great work Dr.
              Thurston!!!</span
