            >A <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author and counselor takes us
            on “a riveting journey” through karmic energy, reincarnation, and
            consciousness—demonstrating how many aspects of our lives can be
            linked to experiences from the past” (Gregg Braden,
            <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author of
            <i>The Wisdom Codes</i>)</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Have you ever wondered why certain life patterns have been so hard to
          turn around? Well, the reasons may be encoded in your eternal
          history—in karmic sources that were set lifetimes ago. Perhaps you
          keep struggling with money problems, feel hopeless about finding true
          love, or have an addiction you can’t seem to beat.<b><br /></b><br />
          These current issues could be traced back to previous lives. Even
          psychological and physical ailments such as chronic pain, allergies,
          weight problems, and self-doubts could originate in unknown past
          events.&nbsp; Yet these past-life sources don’t have to remain a
          mystery—or have any power over you anymore!<br /><br />
          In this enlightening and truly liberating book,
          <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author&nbsp;Sandra Anne
          Taylor&nbsp;explores the energy of karma and reincarnation, revealing
          how your eternal consciousness can become encoded, influencing your
          destiny today.<br /><br />
          When you learn how to release and rescript your karma, you can pave
          the way to joy and personal power—now and in years to come!

          “Through this book, Sandra gives us an understanding of why we’ve made
          certain choices in our life, based on our past lives. She shows us how
          we can break cycles and live the life that we want. This is a
          remarkably eye-opening book that will make you think about the journey
          you’re on.”<br /><b>— Lisa Williams</b>, the best-selling author of
          The Survival of the Soul<br /><br />“Sandra Anne Taylor is a rare
          genius and one of the most remarkable women on the planet today. In
          <i>The Hidden Power of Your Past Lives</i>,&nbsp;she reminds you that
          the opposite of death is birth and that there’s no opposite to life.
          Rather, there’s a continuum from physical life to nonphysical life and
          back again. Through decades of strong focus and conscious living,
          Sandra has brought forth a deeply insightful body of work that offers
          meaning to so many unanswered questions. I enthusiastically endorse
          her teachings—there is much to learn here.”<br /><b
            >— Dr. Darren R. Weissman</b
          >, the best-selling author of Awakening to the Secret Code of Your
          Mind<br /><br />“<i>The Hidden Power of Your Past Lives</i> is a
          powerful tool for healing and success and a truly unique approach to
          the subject of reincarnation. Sandra Anne Taylor’s rare insights,
          techniques, and affirmations can free readers from old blocks and
          attachments and lift them to a wonderful new future that has long been
          buried in the past.”<br /><b>— Colette Baron-Reid</b>, the
          best-selling author of The Map<br />&nbsp;<br />“If the soul evolves
          through many lifetimes, <i>The Hidden Power of Your Past Lives</i> is
          a great user’s manual for this stop on the journey. Not just a
          metaphysical treatise on reincarnation, the book is a practical and
          sophisticated guide for using an understanding of past lives to
          transform the deep coding that shapes your current life.”<br /><b
            >— Donna Eden</b
          >, the best-selling author of Energy Medicine<br /><br />“Along the
          way, there’s content that advances your spiritual realization in one
          quantum burst. Sandra Anne Taylor’s new book,
          <i>The Hidden Power of Your Past Lives</i>, possesses exactly this
          content.<br />“I’ve studied philosophy and religion most of my life.
          During my adventure, I’ve looked into many paths and secret societies
          and even served at the highest of levels in ancient orders, all in my
          quest to become enlightened. Common to almost all of this work is the
          understanding generally referred to as reincarnation. Even the
          Christian tradition is full of references that can only be to past
          lives. <br />“With this background, I must admit that I’ve never read
          anything as clear and cogent as Sandra’s distilled teachings from her
          many years of research and collaboration on the subject. Deep within
          your subconscious mind exists infor-mation that propels you. Whether
          you think past lives are real or not, you’ll want to read this book
          for the power and insight gained from this perspective.”<br /><b
            >— Eldon Taylor</b
          >, the best-selling author of&nbsp;<i>Choices and Illusions</i> and
          <i>Mind Programming</i><br />&nbsp;<br />“Could the key to life’s
          mysteries be hidden in the plain sight of everyday living? Sandra Anne
          Taylor believes so, and in her new book
          <i>The Hidden Power of Your Past Lives</i>, she gives us good reasons
          to believe so as well.<br />“In a riveting journey of case histories
          and personal revelations, she demonstrates how everything from the
          healing of our bodies to the success of our relationships is often
          linked to experiences from the past. If her ideas are right, they
          catapult us light years beyond conventional explanations of the
          seemingly meaningless events in life. One thing is certain: there’s
          something missing in the traditional story of why things ‘are’ as they
          are, and only new thinking will reveal the missing link of our soul’s
          meaning and purpose.<br />“Whether you’re an artist or an engineer,
          this book is about you, your world, and every relationship that you’ll
          ever experience in life.”<br /><b>— Gregg Braden</b>,&nbsp;the
          best-selling author of <i>The Divine Matrix</i> and
