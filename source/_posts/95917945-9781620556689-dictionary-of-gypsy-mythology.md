          A comprehensive A-to-Z reconstruction of the oral tradition of the
          Rom--gypsies--based on sources never before available in English
          <br /><br />• Presents the origin myths and magical traditions of the
          gypsies, including their legendary ties to Egypt, animal ancestors,
          and tree spirits <br /><br />• Examines the three major settings of
          gypsy folktales--the forest, the waters, and the mountain--and shows
          how their world is full of spirits <br /><br />• Shows how the
          religious concepts of the Rom testify to a profound syncretism of the
          pagan traditions and Christianity <br /><br />Although their own myths
          and their common name point to Egyptian origins for the gypsies, the
          Rom, as they call themselves, originated in India, as evidenced by
          studies of their language. They arrived in Europe in the ninth century
          and spread across the continent from East to West, reaching England in
          the 15th century and Scandinavia by the end of the 16th century. A
          nomadic people, these wanderers were reviled by local populaces
          wherever they went and regarded as misfits, intruders, foreigners, and
          thieves. <br /><br />Drawing on a number of sources never before
          available outside of Eastern Europe, Claude Lecouteux reconstructs the
          gypsy oral tradition to provide a comprehensive A-to-Z look at gypsy
          mythology, including their folktales, rites, songs, nursery rhymes,
          jokes, and magical traditions. His main source is material collected
          by Heinrich Adalbert von Wlislocki (1856-1907), an ethnologist who
          lived with gypsies in Romania, Transylvania, and Hungary in the latter
          half of the 19th century. He presents the origin myths of the gypsies,
          legends which form the ancestral memory of the gypsy tribes and often
          closely touch on their daily life. <br /><br />Lecouteux explores the
          full range of supernatural beings that inhabit the gypsy world,
          including fairies, undines, ogres, giants, dog-people, and demons, and
          he examines the three major settings of gypsy folktales--the forest,
          the waters, and the mountain, which they worshiped as a sacred being
          in its own right. He also reveals how coexisting with peoples of
          different religions led the gypsies to adapt or borrow stories and
          figures from these groups, and he shows how the religious concepts and
          sacred stories of the Rom testify to a profound syncretism of pagan
          traditions and Christianity. <br /><br />Complete with rare
          illustrations and information from obscure sources appearing for the
          first time in English, this detailed reference work represents an
          excellent resource for scholars and those seeking to reconnect to
          their forgotten gypsy heritage.

          “<i>Dictionary of Gypsy Mythology</i> by Claude Lecouteux is an
          eye-opening revelation of the wealth and riches of a people and
          culture struck by hatred and poverty from their fellow humans due to
          their needs and ways. A deeply needed recognition and sharing of a
          group long reviled and antagonized that was able to keep its soul
          alive in the face of persecution. Truly the heart of the Gypsy is
          worth its weight in gold. An invaluable history and insight into a
          unique and strong people.”
