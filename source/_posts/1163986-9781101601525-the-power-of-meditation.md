          “Finally a book has been written that explains everything you need to
          know about meditation and how to get started again.&nbsp; Dr.
          Viljoen's wisdom is profound and yet also forgiving for those of us
          who've been feeling guilty for not using this ancient practice.”<br />—<b
            >Chris Michaels</b
          >, author of <i>Your Soul’s Assignment</i><br />&nbsp;<br />“Edward
          Viljoen is to meditation what water is to thirst. This marvelous book
          guides both the novice and the experienced through a series of steps
          that aids in quelling the cacophony of everyday life and allowing the
          inherent peacefulness of being to emerge in one's experience and
          expression of the beauty of life. It is a constructive and productive
          guide to living a life that is balanced, calm and peaceful.”<br />—<b

          ><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;“Edward Viljoen’s new book,
          <b>The Power of Meditation</b>, is a gift. It serves as a practical
          guidebook for those who are new at spiritual practice, as well as a
          beautiful reminder of simplicity and essence for those who have been
          engaged in spiritual practice for a lifetime. Edward helps us find the
          strength we need to be present with whatever life brings. He takes the
          reader by the hand, dispels the mysteries, and makes this elusive
          thing called meditation very real and doable.”<br />—<b>Alan Seal</b>,

            >The Power of Meditation</b
          >
          opens a window from antiquity that blows in a breath of fresh air for
          the seeker looking to trade in the “rush hour rat race” for a "hush
          hour life break.” The meditation practices that he offers in this book
          are so inclusive that even the most skeptical will be hooked in the
          stillness. Edward Viljoen has masterfully introduced us to the “new
          action” that is sure to inspire and empower people to design and live
          the lives of their dreams.”<br />—<b>Kevin Kitrell Ross</b>, author,
          <i>The Designer Life</i><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thank goodness for this
          book! Until I read <b>The Power of Meditation</b>, I wondered if
          something was wrong with me. My friends and colleagues seemed to have
          a great relationship with meditation—they even appeared to enjoy
          it—while I struggled and wondered if there was a better way to
          enlightenment. Now that I've read <b>The Power of Meditation</b>, I
          have a renewed enthusiasm for this spiritual practice and I even look
          forward to it. Thank you, Edward!”<br />—<b>David Bruner</b>, Center
          for Spiritual Living, San Jose<br />&nbsp;<br />“Edward Viljoen never
          ceases to amaze me with his depth of compassion, wisdom and
          peacefulness. I believe all this comes from his personal commitment to
          all kinds of mindfulness practices. If he is an example of a person
          who meditates, then we all should read this book.”<br />—<b
