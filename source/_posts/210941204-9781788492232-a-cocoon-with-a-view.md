            Back in the last weeks of February, which now feels like a hundred
            years ago, we here in Innishannon were busy planning what was&nbsp;
            termed 'The Big Rake Off' of the dead grass on the long sloping bank
            beside the road coming into the village.&nbsp;Happily unaware of
            forthcoming events, we were totally focused on creating our wild
            flower bank: to get something like this going you need a 'metheal',
            a word which prior to the corona virus was unknown to anyone under
            40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Then everything changed ... Exploring the themes of community,
            family and personal wellbeing, Alice Taylor examines a world changed
            utterly by the arrival of a once-in-a-century infectious disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Heart-warming, reflective yet always practical, Alice is a wonderful
            guide in a world unlike the one we lived in only a few short months
            ago.

          Alice Taylor lives in the village of Innishannon in County Cork, in a
          house
          <br />
          attached to the local supermarket and post office. Since her eldest
          son has
          <br />
          taken over responsibility for the shop, she has been able to devote
          more time
          <br />
          to her writing. Alice Taylor worked as a telephonist in Killarney and
          Bandon.
          <br />
          When she married, she moved to Innishannon where she ran a guesthouse
          at
          <br />
          first, then the supermarket and post office.
          <br />
          To School Through the Fields was published in May 1988. It was an
          immediate
          <br />
          success, and quickly became the biggest selling book ever published in
          <br />
          Ireland. Alice has written nearly twenty books since then, large
          exploring her
          <br />
          village of Inishannon, and the way of life in rural Ireland. One of
          Ireland's most
          <br />
          popular authors, her most recent book is And Life Lights Up.
