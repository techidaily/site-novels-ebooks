            <i>Find your Soul Path</i> seamlessly blends spirituality with
            self-help as it seeks to give the reader the tools to begin to live
            in a more conscious way. Author and eclectic witch Emma Griffin
            shows the reader how to discover their soul-purpose and move through
            the world in a way that starts from a place of purpose and
            authenticity and allows that to radiate out. Starting in the home,
            all areas of life are explored, with mindfulness, intuition, and
            empowerment leading the way. A fantastic introduction to developing
            a spiritual practice, <i>Find your</i> <i>Soul Path</i> is a gentle
            exploration of the most easily accessible aspects of witchcraft
            presented - alongside genuinely helpful life advice - in a way that
            will appeal to those interested in new age spirituality and the role
            it can play in modern life.<br /><br />Written with the busy modern
            woman in mind, ideas and tips for practical ways to find moments of
            peace and connection are included that are easy to fit into everyday
            life, such as creating a morning ritual, a bath ritual and
            journaling prompts. Author Emma Griffin shares her wisdom and sage
            advice, gained over a lifetime of seeking deep connection with
            nature and the soul, for moving through the challenges of the modern
            world in an empowered way that celebrates the divine feminine.<br /><br />With
            a focus on connecting to the true self,
            <i>Find Your Soul Path</i> presents the ancient wisdom of womanhood
            to a new generation of witches and the spiritually curious, with
            easily followed rituals for celebrating the sabbats of the Wheel of
            the Year and practical journaling exercises that help the reader to
            dive deep on their quest for personal peace and enlightenment.<br /><br />A
            beginner's guide, this is a book for the open-minded reader who is
            interested in getting in touch with their more spiritual side, and
            exploring how they can use their intuition to lead a life that feels
            more authentic and full of intention.

        <p>
          Emma Griffin is a fine artist, fashion illustrator, photographer, and
          eclectic witch based in Cornwall. Brought up in a magical household
          with a well-known tarot reader for a mother and a psychic medium for a
          father, her career took her into the world of corporate fashion which
          left little space for magic.<br /><br />In 2019, she launched her
          online platform Sacred Spaces as a means of reconnecting with her
          magical roots, and living a more authentic life. Since then, she has
          amassed over 80k followers on Instagram and built a reputation as a
          modern-day sage. Emma believes in looking within to harness the power
          of intuition and is the perfect guide for all those looking to do the
          same.
