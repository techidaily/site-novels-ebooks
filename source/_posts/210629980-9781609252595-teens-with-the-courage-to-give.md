          Lately, troubled teens have been dominating the headlines. But there
          are other stories that deserve the spotlight--stories about the many
          teenagers who have dedicated themselves to important, socially useful
          volunteer work and who will lead their generation toward a more
          hopeful tomorrow. The fourth in Conari Press' "Call to Action" series,
          <i>Teens with the Courage to Give</i> profiles thirty amazing young
          people throughout the United States and Canada who overcame great
          personal odds to reach out and help others while healing themselves in
          the process. Each has founded or is linked to a nonprofit organization
          that is also profiled in the book, to encourage other teens to embrace
          volunteerism. In these inspiring pages, to name just a few of these
          heroic teenagers, you'll meet an amputee who runs in the Paralympics
          and spurs others on with his inner resolve; the son of a cancer
          patient who created support groups around the country for kids with
          sick parents; a girl who helped her mother and younger sister as they
          died of aids and who is now an aids awareness and prevention
          volunteer; and one of the students from the Littleton, Colorado,
          shooting who has gone on to create a teen drop-in center. Through
          their courageous first-person stories, these teens show that they are
          part of the solution to what ails today's society. Includes an
          extensive resource guide of volunteer opportunities and a
          classroom/group discussion guide.
