          A guide to the 60,000-year-old healing system of the Aborigines
          revealed through one man’s journey to overcome multiple sclerosis
          <br />
          <br />• Written at the request of the Aboriginal people the author
          stayed with <br />
          <br />• Explores the use of dreamtime, spirit guides, and telepathy to
          discover and reprogram the subconscious motivations, thought patterns,
          and beliefs behind illness <br />
          <br />• Reveals how to tap in to healing support through the
          body/mind/spirit connection <br />
          <br />• Nautilus Silver Medal Winner and <i>ForeWord Reviews</i> Book
          of the Year Finalist <br />
          <br />In 1983 award-winning physicist Gary Holz was diagnosed with
          chronic progressive multiple sclerosis. By 1988 he was a quadriplegic.
          Then, in 1994, his doctors told him he had two years to live.
          Desperate and depressed, he followed a synchronistic suggestion and
          went to Australia to live with a remote Aboriginal tribe. Arriving in
          a wheelchair, alone, with almost no feeling left from the neck down,
          Holz embarked on a remarkable healing transformation of body, mind,
          and spirit and discovered his own gift for healing others. <br />
          <br />Written at the request of the Aboriginal healers Holz worked
          with, this book reveals the beliefs and principles of the
          60,000-year-old healing system of the Aborigines of Australia, the
          world’s oldest continuous culture. Chronicling the step-by-step
          process that led to his miraculous recovery, he explains the role
          played by thought in the creation of health or disease and details the
          five essential steps in the Aboriginal healing process. He explores
          the use of dreamtime, spirit guides, and telepathy to discover and
          reprogram the subconscious motivations behind illness--a process that
          enacts healing at the cellular and the soul level, where the root of
          physical illness is found. <br />
          <br />Supported by modern science, including quantum physics,
          Aboriginal medicine enables each of us to tap in to healing support
          through the power of the body/mind/spirit connection.

        <p>
          Gary Holz, D.Sc. (1950-2007), was an award-winning physicist and a
          psycho-neuro-immunologist. In 1994, confined to a wheelchair with
          multiple sclerosis, he went to Australia to stay with an Aboriginal
          tribe and experienced miraculous healing. Robbie Holz is a holistic
          health consultant dedicated to continuing the healing work of her late
          husband. She healed herself of hepatitis C and has also worked with
          Aboriginal healers in Australia. She lives near Seattle.
