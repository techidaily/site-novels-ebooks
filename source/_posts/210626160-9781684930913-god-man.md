          <p>
            God-Man: The Word Made Flesh (1920) is a book of mysticism exploring
            how the allegories of scripture relate to the truths of the cosmos
            and the human body. Within many of the Biblical parables, George W.
            Carey and Inez Eudora Perry find that many of the people described
            were in fact personifications of the wisdom needed to reach
            spiritual enlightenment.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            George Washington Carey (1845-1924) and Inez Eudora Perry
            (1871-1961) were collaborators on topics of astrology, homeopathy,
            and biochemistry. Combining Christianity, ancient religions,
            physiology, anatomy, and more, Dr. Carey and Ms. Perry sought the
            answers to the nature of humanity and God.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            One of the pair's lasting contributions was to the field of
            biochemistry. Influenced by Dr. Wilhelm Heinrich Schüßler who
            identified cell-salts-naturally occurring minerals that could
            supplement deficiencies in the human body-Dr. Carey went further,
            associating the signs of the zodiac to a natural deficiency in these
            minerals. Through careful supplementation, he believed that one
            could cure a host of physical and psychological ailments.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Astrologer Inez Eudora Perry was an adherent to Dr. Carey's ideas.
            The pair wrote several works together, including The Tree of Life
            and Relation of the Mineral Salts of the Body to the Signs of the
            Zodiac. In 1923, Dr. Carey made Ms. Perry a partner in his
            biochemical foundation, which was renamed The Carey-Perry School of
            The Chemistry of Life.

          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            God-Man: The Word Made Flesh explores the allegory within scripture.
            Rather than taking each parable as literal truth, their
            interpretation draws on knowledge of the human body, astrology,
            world religions, and symbolism to find the real meaning behind the
            Biblical text.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In the story of Sara and Abram, for example, they explain that
            rather than a literal story in which a 90-year-old woman (Sara) and
            100-year-old man (Abram) give birth to a son (Isaac), their real
            "child" is happiness-the meaning of the word Isaac in Hebrew. The
            true lesson is that "...age imposes no limit or barrier to the birth
            of the 'Incorruptible Seed' (Peter) for it is eternal life."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            "Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Noah, David, Solomon, Isaiah, etc., etc.,
            are not historical characters," he writes. Nor are Pontius Pilate,
            Pharaoh, or Herod, which are names of offices or functions rather
            than individuals. Through exploring the meanings of these names,
            down to the letters that create them in the original Hebrew, the
            writers find new truth in the stories that have been misinterpreted
            for so long.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            At the center of this truth is the idea that the parables in the
            Bible were meant to describe the human body as a microcosm of the
            universe. But at the council of Nicea, it was voted that "...the
            symbols of the human body were persons; that Jesus was a certain
            historical man, a contention utterly and indubitably without
            foundation, in fact, and that all who believed (?) the story would
            be saved and forgiven here and now." From this vote, the true
            meaning of the scriptures was hidden from us, preventing us from
            reaching our highest physical and spiritual wellness.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Further complicating these misunderstandings are the myriad
            translations of the Biblical text. By revisiting and retranslating
            the original Greek and Hebrew, the authors seek to return to the
            original meaning of the words rather than relying on another's
            interpretation of them.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            For the seeker of truth and the student of mysticism, God-Man: The
            Word Made Flesh is a valuable contribution to your studies.
