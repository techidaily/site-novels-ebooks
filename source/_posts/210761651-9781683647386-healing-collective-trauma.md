              >A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding and Healing Shared
              Trauma</b
            ><br /><br />What can you do when you carry scars not on your body,
            but within your soul? And what happens when those spiritual wounds
            exist not just in you, but in everyone in your family, community,
            and even beyond?<br /><br />Spiritual teacher Thomas Hübl has spent
            years investigating why it is that old and seemingly disconnected
            traumas can seed their way through communities and across
            generations. His work culminates in
            <i>Healing Collective Trauma</i>, a new perspective on trauma that
            addresses both its visible effects and its most hidden roots. Thomas
            combines deep knowledge of mystical traditions with the latest
            scientific research. “In this way,” writes Thomas, “we are weaving a
            double helix between ancient wisdom and contemporary
            understanding.”<br /><br />Thomas details the Collective Trauma
            Integration Process, a group-based modality for evoking and
            eventually dissolving stuck traumatic energies. Providing structured
            practices for both students and group facilitators,
            <i>Healing Collective Trauma </i>is intended to build a practical
            tool kit for integration.<br /><br />Here, you will learn:<br /><br />•
            The innumerable ways trauma shapes our world—from identity and
            health to economy, geopolitics, and the state of the environment<br />•
            The concept of “trauma loyalty”—unconscious group bonds based in a
            pain narrative<br />• How the climate crisis is both a manifestation
            of humanity’s collective trauma and an opportunity to heal<br />•
            “Retrocausality”—how the power of presence can reshape the past and
            make new futures possible<br /><br />Including essays contributed by
            experts such as Dr. Gabor Maté, Dr. Otto Scharmer, Dr. Christina
            Bethell, and Ken Wilber, <i>Healing Collective Trauma </i>offers not
            just an advanced look at community trauma but also a hopeful glimpse
            of the future. As Thomas declares, “Together, I believe we can and
            must heal the ‘soul wound’ that marks us all. In so doing, we will
            awaken to the luminous possibility and profound potential of our
            true, mutual nature as humankind.”

          <b>Thomas Hübl</b> is a renowned teacher, author, and international
          facilitator whose lifelong work integrates the core insights of the
          great wisdom traditions and mysticism with the discoveries of science.
          Since the early 2000s, he has been leading large-scale events and
          courses that focus on the healing and integration of trauma, with a
          special focus on the shared history of Israelis and Germans. Over the
          last decade, he has facilitated dialogue with thousands of people
          around healing the collective traumas of racism, oppression,
          colonialism, and genocides, in the US, Israel, Germany, Spain, and
          Argentina. He has been teaching workshops and presenting trainings for
          Harvard Medical School since 2019. His nonprofit organization, the
          Pocket Project, works to support the healing of collective trauma
          throughout the world. He is the author of the book
          <i
            >Healing Collective Trauma: A Process for Integrating Our
            Intergenerational and Cultural Wounds</i
          >, which outlines his methodology called the Collective Trauma
          Integration Process as a safe framework for guiding groups through
          collective trauma. Learn more at thomashuebl.com.<br /><br /><b
