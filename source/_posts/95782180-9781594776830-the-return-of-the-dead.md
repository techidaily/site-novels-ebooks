          How the ghost stories of pagan times reveal the seamless union
          existing between the world of the living and the afterlife <br />
          <br />• Demonstrates how Medieval Christianity transformed the more
          corporeal ghost encountered in pagan cultures with the disembodied
          form known today <br />
          <br />• Explains how the returning dead were once viewed as either
          troublemakers or guarantors of the social order <br />
          <br />The impermeable border the modern world sees existing between
          the world of the living and the afterlife was not visible to our
          ancestors. The dead could--and did--cross back and forth at will. The
          pagan mind had no fear of death, but some of the dead were definitely
          to be dreaded: those who failed to go peacefully into the afterlife
          but remained on this side in order to right a wrong that had befallen
          them personally or to ensure that the law promoted by the ancestors
          was being respected. But these dead individuals were a far cry from
          the amorphous ectoplasm that is featured in modern ghost stories.
          These earlier visitors from beyond the grave--known as
          revenants--slept, ate, and fought like men, even when, like Klaufi of
          the <i>Svarfdaela Saga</i>, they carried their heads in their arms.
          <br />
          <br />Revenants were part of the ancestor worship prevalent in the
          pagan world and still practiced in indigenous cultures such as the
          Fang and Kota of equatorial Africa, among others. The Church, eager to
          supplant this familial faith with its own, engineered the
          transformation of the corporeal revenant into the disembodied ghost of
          modern times, which could then be easily discounted as a figment of
          the imagination or the work of the devil. The sanctified grounds of
          the church cemetery replaced the burial mounds on the family farm,
          where the ancestors remained as an integral part of the living
          community. This exile to the formal graveyard, ironically enough, has
          contributed to the great loss of the sacred that characterizes the
          modern world.
