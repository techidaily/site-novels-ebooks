          Slaves of Satan is an extraordinary book that looks at the darkest
          corners of the human and diabolical mind and answers the question of
          why. Why do human beings commit some of the most horrific, appalling,
          and unspeakable acts known to man. What is it that drives these evil
          people; serial killers, cult leaders, occultists, and dictators to
          leave a trail of murder, violence, sexual depravity, and total
          unmitigated destruction in their wake. Author Patrick Bell through
          years of extensive research has done a deep dive into one of religions
          most controversial and terrifying subjects, diabolical possession, and
          the most serious and horrifying form of it known as Perfect
          Possession. When a human being has given themselves, their intellect,
          mind, will and body, their very souls over completely to the source of
          all evil, Lucifer. The author examines the theology and church
          teaching behind perfect possession, the three types of it, who it
          occurs to and why and then examines people from history (Slaves of
          Satan) who were perfectly possessed including serial killers,
          dictators, the international occult elite and the diabolical deeds and
          destruction they have perpetrated, led on by their master the devil,
          upon the human race.

        <p>
          Patrick Ryan Bell was born and raised in West Bend, WI. From the very
          earliest age Patrick was fascinated by the supernatural and all things
          mysterious. He was raised in the Catholic faith and all the stories
          about the Devil, Diabolical Possession, Miracles, and Ghosts that are
          part of Catholic history greatly interested him. From age 7 Patrick
          started reading books about Ghosts, Haunted Houses, The Devil,
          Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, The Bermuda Triangle, Ancient Egyptian
          Curses and Miraculous Phenomena. His studies continued until age 14
          when he got involved in the wrong crowd in High Patrick Ryan Bell was

          books about Ghosts, Haunted Houses, The Devil, Bigfoot, The Loch Ness
          Monster, The Bermuda Triangle, Ancient Egyptian Curses and Miraculous
          Phenomena. His studies continued until age 14 when he got involved in
          the wrong crowd in High School and started using drugs. When Patrick
          was 23 years old, he had an amazing, miraculous and intense conversion
          experience when he saw a diabolic apparition and subsequently had an
          encounter with a possessed person. This experience terrified Patrick
          and changed the entire course of his life. From that day on Patrick
          devoted himself to the study of religious demonology, angelology,
          possession and exorcism to try and come to an understanding of what
          happened to him and what he saw. Patrick began work on the current
          volume in 2015 and spent many years researching and writing the book
          before you. Patrick has been studying demonology and all related
          subjects for over 20 years now and is an expert in demonology, the
          Devil, and diabolical phenomena. Patrick is currently doing research
          on and working on two additional books. Patrick plans on finishing his
          degree at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and eventually wants
          to start work on advanced degrees in psychology and Catholic theology.
          Patrick currently lives in Wisconsin, on the shores of Lake Michigan
          with his two beautiful daughters.
