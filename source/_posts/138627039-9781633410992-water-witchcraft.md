            Let Annwyn Avalon, a practicing water witch herself, take you into
            the world of water magic. The water magic and lore in this book
            focuses on the Celtic tradition, but draws on other water magic
            traditions as well, and features rainwater, as well as lakes,
            rivers, oceans, canals, swamps, and other watery locations, together
            with the folk and magical customs that have been and are still
            practiced at these places. The book teaches the reader how to set up
            a water altar at home, how to connect with water spirits, and how to
            gather or create water witch tools. Readers are encouraged to visit
            local water sites but will also find an abundance of material to
            perform at home. Included are practical examples, visualizations,
            and exercises so any reader can start to take up spell work and
            establish their spiritual connection to water.
