          <p>
            When it comes to understanding the dead, there is something unusual
            about the Hudson Valley; so many ghost stories have come out of this
            region. Some have become a part of our national lore such as
            Washington Irving’s retelling of the legends about Rip Van Winkle
            and Sleepy Hollow. Most, however, have remained in the Valley where
            they have been retold from generation to generation. Ghosts in
            Residence is a collection of stories told by – and in many cases,
            witnessed by – renown photographer H.A. von Behr during his time
            living in the Hudson Valley.
          </p>
          <p>
            The intimate stories have, since the original publication of this
            book, become classics in the region and taken on a legendary quality
            all their own. The book also includes original black and white
            photographs taken by von Behr of the houses, graves, and people
            featured within. From the hauntings of dilapidated country manors
            and castles, unexplained phenomena along the Valley hillsides, and
            strange apparitions found lingering within ancient Quaker
            cemeteries, this collection of stories reveals the otherworldly
            legacy of the Hudson Valley as a place of ancient spirits.

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          H.A von Behr began his career as a research metallurgist, but
          photography drew his interest from childhood on, and in 1931 he
          started his own studio in New York City. A few years later he was
          elected a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society of Great Britain
          and was awarded the Diplome D’Honeur L’Association Belge De
          Photographie et De Cinematographie. His pictorial photographs have
          been awarded prizes in London, Paris, Brussels, Copenhagen, Boston,
          Chicago, and New York. He has been an instructor of Photography at New
          York University, introducing Photo-Journalism there and he has written
          and illustrated many magazine articles. A number of famous men and
          women have had portraits done by Mr. von Behr, including Eleanor
          Roosevelt, Gloria Vanderbilt, Mrs. Charles Dana Gibson, Lee Remick,
          Claudio Arau, Sir William Elliott, Count Felix von Luckner and the
          Eisenhower grandchildren. Retired from his studio and residing in
          Manhattan, he and his wife, Ruth, are nature lovers and try to retreat
          to their woodland farm in Columbia County, New York as much as
          possible. It is there that he is inspired to do much of his writing.
