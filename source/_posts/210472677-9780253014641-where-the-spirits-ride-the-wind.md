            personal mythology and parapsychology</b
          ><br /><br /><i
            >“And suddenly the understanding of my own vision washed over me
            like a mighty wave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For life or for death, I was
            committed to that mighty realm of which I was shown a brief
            reminder, the world where all was forever motion and emergence, that
            realm where the spirits ride the wind.” —from the Prologue</i
          ><br /><br />Anthropologist and spiritual explorer Felicitas Goodman
          reexamines our notions of the nature of reality by studying the ritual
          postures of native art assumed by her subjects during trance states.
          For readers desiring to discover this world of ancient myths, she has
          included a practical guide on how to achieve such ecstatic
          experiences.<br /><br /><b
            >“The book is clearly written for the general reader and includes
            many descriptions of trance experiences. It may serve as a good
            introduction to the nature and appeal of the shamanic revival in
            modern Western cultures.” —<i>Theological Book Review</i></b

            >“A case study in experiential anthropology that offers a unique mix
            of autobiography, mythology, experiential research, and
            archaeological data to support a challenging thesis—that certain
            body postures may help induce specific trance states.” —<i

          Academic backgroundIn 1965, at age 51, she returned to graduate school
          completing a master's degree at Ohio State University in linguistics
          in 1968 and a doctorate in cultural anthropology in 1971. From 1968
          until her forced retirement in 1979, she taught linguistics, cultural
          anthropology and comparative religions at Denison University,
          Ohio.Contributions to anthropologyFelicitas Goodman made two major
          contributions to the field of anthropology: one concerned
          "glossolalia" or "speaking in tongues;" the other concerned religious
          ecstatic trance. Felicitas noted frequent discussion of an odd kind of
          speech people spoke while they were "possessed." As a linguist, this
          intrigued her. Ethnographers called it "unintelligible speech."&nbsp;
          She developed a working hypothesis that the striking accent and
          intonation patterns of such speech, as well as certain phonetic
          features were NOT a different kind of natural language, which was the
          "received view" on her field. (1969. "Phonetic Analysis of Glossolalia
          in Four Cultural Settings." Journal for the Scientific Study of
          Religion. 8: 227-239.) Religious ecstatic trance Dr. Goodman's
          research, publications, and on-going experience in this field are her
          major contribution to anthropology. In her book, Where the Spirits
          Ride the Wind, she notes how trance experience was a normal part of
          her life until the age of puberty when she was advised to leave behind
          the experiences of childhood. Happily, Felicitas did not do that. The
          Cuyamugue Institute in Santa Fe, NM In 1963 she purchased 270 acres
          for her in the area known as Cuyamungue, the name of an ancient pueblo
          in the area. In 1965, she discovered a place to erect a building on
          her property, and thus the Institute had its beginning.&nbsp;
          Cuyamungue: The Felicitas D. Goodman Institute which continues her
          research and holds workshops about the postures which are one of the
          doors to the alternate reality.
