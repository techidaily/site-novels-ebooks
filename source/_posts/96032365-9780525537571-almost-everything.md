              >From Anne Lamott, the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling author of
              <i>Dusk, Night, Dawn</i> and&nbsp;<i>Help, Thanks, Wow, </i>comes
              the book we need from her now: How to bring hope back into our
              lives<br /></b></b
          ><br />"I am stockpiling antibiotics for the Apocalypse, even as I
          await the blossoming of paperwhites on the windowsill in the kitchen,"
          Anne Lamott admits at the beginning of <i>Almost Everything</i>.
          Despair and uncertainty surround us: in the news, in our families, and
          in ourselves. But even when life is at its bleakest--when we are, as
          she puts it, "doomed, stunned, exhausted, and over-caffeinated"--the
          seeds of rejuvenation are at hand. "All truth is paradox," Lamott
          writes, "and this turns out to be a reason for hope. If you arrive at
          a place in life that is miserable, it will change." That is the time
          when we must pledge not to give up but "to do what Wendell Berry
          wrote: 'Be joyful, though you have considered all the facts.'"
          <br /><br />In this profound and funny book, Lamott calls for each of
          us to rediscover the nuggets of hope and wisdom that are buried within
          us that can make life sweeter than we ever imagined. Divided into
          short chapters that explore life's essential truths, Almost Everything
          pinpoints these moments of insight as it shines an encouraging light
          forward. <br /><br />Candid and caring, insightful and sometimes
          hilarious, <i>Almost Everything </i>is the book we need and that only
          Anne Lamott can write.

          <b>Praise for <i>Almost Everything</i>:</b> <br /><br />“Anne Lamott
          has a rare talent for making writing look easy... Given the warmth,
          liveliness and intimacy of her prose, time with one of her books can
          feel like a visit with a friend.”<b> —</b><i>Wall Street Journal</i>
          <br /><br />“Part memoir, part manual and part sermon from the church
          of Lamott, this satisfying escape points to notes of beauty in our
          uncertain world.” <b>—</b><i>People</i> <br /><br />“Like a feminist
          C.S. Lewis, [Lamott] talks about God, politics and other
          unmentionables, and gently exhorts her readers, as she does herself,
          to find joy in a bleak and chaotic world: a leftie guru of optimism.”
          <b>—</b><i>The New York Times&nbsp;</i> <br /><br />“[Lamott] cheers
          us on with her blend of sobering truth and essential inspiration.”<b
            >—</b
          ><i>Parade Magazine</i> <br /><br />“Plenty of us have grown to trust
          Lamott’s spiritual compass. We settle in quickly here, knowing just
          around the next sentence she might pry open our heart, and pack in
          truths we will mull long after we’ve put down her pages... Again and
          again, Lamott steers us in and out of the canyons and potholes of
          despair.” <i>—Chicago Tribune</i
          ><b
            ><b><br /></b
          ></b>
          <br />“By the time you finish&nbsp;<i
            >Almost Everything: Notes on Hope</i
          >&nbsp;by Anne Lamott, you might find yourself just a little bit
          changed as a person. In the book, she candidly discusses her journey
          to finding hope, and it's full of beautiful pieces of advice that
          you'll find yourself highlighting on your Kindle over and over again.”
          —PopSugar, Recommended Books of 2018<br /><br />“Many are deeply
          blessed by Ms. Lamott’s down-to-Earth spirituality, her cleverness,
          her ability to tell a story with a moral, or at least with a sensible
          point.”<b> —</b><i>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</i> <br /><br />“That is
          what the wise and wonderful&nbsp;Anne Lamott&nbsp;considers with
          uncommon self-awareness and generosity of insight throughout&nbsp;<i
            >Almost Everything: Notes on Hope</i
          >— the small, enormously soul-salving book that gave us Lamott
          on&nbsp;love, despair, and our capacity for change.” —<i
            >Brain Pickings<br
          /></i>
          <br />“Lamott boldly sets out to share . . . she veers from the
          intensely personal to the philosophical, highlighting some of the ways
          joy and pain are close companions in life. . . . Anyone reading with
          an open mind and heart will come away with more than a few nuggets of
          useful wisdom.” —<i>BookPage</i><b> </b> <br /><br />“<i
            >Anne Lamott</i
          >&nbsp;is our wickedly funny, self-deprecating, insightful guardian
          angel, and she's given us the gift of hope” —<i>Pasadena Star News</i>
          <b><br /></b> <br /><b>Praise for Anne Lamott and Her Books:</b>
          <br /><br />“Lamott is a superb writer. Her voice is one-of-a-kind:
          deft, folksy, cheerfully hostile. . . . She is witty and funny and
          smart.” —<i>The Washington Post</i> “A clarion call to the better
          angels of our nature.” —<i>Chicago Tribune</i> <br />“I keep learning
          a lot from the clear and great Annie Lamott. I think you will, too.”
          —Gloria Steinem <br /><br />“Lamott is beloved by legions for her
          smart, irreverent take on the human condition, filtered through her
          unique brand of compassionate Christianity and delivered with
          delicious, self-deprecating wit. Lamott goes even deeper in these
          essays.” —<i>People </i> <i> </i> <i> </i> <br /><br />“Anne Lamott is
          a cause for celebration. [Her] real genius lies in capturing the
          ineffable, describing not perfect moments, but imperfect ones . . .
          perfectly. She is nothing short of miraculous.”<i>
            —The New Yorker
          </i>
          <i> </i> <br /><br />“Lamott is funny, witty and irreverent. . . . Her
          basic message is love and forgiveness. . . . Not a bad message for any
          faith.” —<i>The Denver Post</i> <br /><br />“Best bathtub read for me
          would be anything by Anne Lamott. . . . She always makes me laugh and
          she embraces all the broken bits.” —Andie MacDowell, actress
