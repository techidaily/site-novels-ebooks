            In this transformational classic, Florence teaches the power of
            positive thought. She explains how our thoughts and words affect the
            experience we have in our daily lives, and uses concrete examples to
            show how we can use them to bring more of what we want into our
            lives, including abundance, love and success. A wonderful and
            simple-to-follow book on the power of right thinking. This little
            book has inspired thousands of people around the world to find a
            sense of purpose and belonging. Whatever we send out into the world
            will eventually be returned to us, which means that if we give love,
            we will be loved, but if we hate we will in turn feel hated. Through
            what we give and receive, we shape our reality.<br />The book
            includes the following chapters:<br /># &nbsp;The Game<br />#
            &nbsp;The Law of Prosperity<br /># &nbsp;The Power of the Word<br />#
            &nbsp;The Law of Nonresistance<br /># &nbsp;The Law of Karma and the
            Law of Forgiveness<br /># &nbsp;Casting the Burden Impressing the
            Subconscious<br /># &nbsp;Love<br /># &nbsp;Intuition or Guidance<br />#
            &nbsp;Perfect Self Expression or the Divine Design<br />#
            &nbsp;Denials and Affirmations

            <strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</strong><br /><strong
              >Florence Scovel Shinn</strong
            >
            was a woman ahead of her time. To many, she is considered to be
            among the likes of James Allen, Wallace D. Wattles and Napoleon
            Hill. She had the ability to explain her success principles and how
            they work in an entertaining and easy-to-read style. She can be
            considered one of last century's most popular success teachers.<br />Florence
            Scovel Shinn was born on September 24, 1871, in Camden, New Jersey
            to Alden Cortland Scovel and Emily Hopkinson. She had an older
            sister and a younger brother. She was educated at Friends Central
            School in Philadelphia. She later studied art at the Pennsylvania
            Academy of Fine Arts from 1889 to 1897. While there, she met Everett
            Shinn, a painter of impressionistic canvases and realistic murals.
            They married shortly after Florence graduated from the art academy.
            The Shinns moved to New York where both pursued their separate
            careers, Everett in the theatre while Florence did illustrations for
            children's literature in magazines and books.<br />In 1925, Florence
            decided to publish her first book 'The Game of Life and How to Play
            It'. After unsuccessfully finding a publisher for her work, she
            published it herself. Her second book, 'Your Word is Your Wand'
            followed in 1928 and her final book 'The Secret Door to Success' was
            published in 1940 shortly before her death on October 17, 1940. A
            fourth book, 'The Power of the Spoken Word' is a compendium of her
            notes, gathered by one of her students and published posthumously in
            1945.
