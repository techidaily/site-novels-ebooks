              >If someone really wants to change, to grow as a person, what is
              the best medicine? What are the most direct routes? How do you
              discover who you are? How do you find the courage to share it with
              the world once you know?&nbsp;</span

              >Reading is one. We read to understand. We read to learn, to find
              something we didn't even know we were looking for. We read to find
              community -- both with past and present authors, and with the
              others who read with us. We read to be enriched.</span

              >Meditating is another. Here you have, at your disposal, 365
              different quotes and the books they came from, along with a
              question (or two or three) for meditation. The world does not need
              another grabbag of quotes. We wanted a book more like the kind it
              was influenced by. We wanted it to contain the transformative
              potential it celebrated, discussed, and meditated
              upon.&nbsp;</span

            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >This book is designed to bring you clarity, not clutter. We live
              in the information age. Marcus Aurelius says, "What doesn't
              transmit light creates its own darkness." On the other hand,
              Erasmus points out, "Give light, and the darkness will disappear
              of itself." We're infiltrated by information fighting for our
              attention, fighting to persuade us, to manipulate us, to shape who
              we are, how we think, believe, and behave. This book is intended
              -- with a focus on self-exploration and personal identity -- to
              help you construct who you are, and how you want to feel, think,
              believe, and behave for yourself.&nbsp;</span

            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"
              >The quotes inspire, comfort, and challenge. They represent a wide
              diversity of experiences and ideas. They are intended for you to
              actively think, reflect, feel, and meditate upon. This book meets
              you where you're at. The power of reading with a purpose, combined
              with meditating's transformative potential, will bear fruit in
              your life. What that fruit is, how long it will take you to
              arrive, how dedicated you are to the process, all that is up to
              you. It all depends on the seeker, the curious one, why you're
              seeking, and what you're going to do about what you discover. This
              book is a guide, a traveling companion. This book is about
              you.&nbsp;</span
