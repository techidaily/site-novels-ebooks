          <p><strong>Awaken Your Shamanic Soul</strong></p>
          <p>
            Respected kamasqa curandero Oscar Miro-Quesada teaches shamanism as
            a tradition of healing, power, and wisdom that sees all life as
            interconnected and sacred. Understand the shamanic art of a noble
            death, becoming a hollow bone, traveling through the three worlds,
            and how to embrace the imaginal beauty of a living, sentient, and
            ever-evolving cosmos.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel soul-animating moments with Creation itself as don Oscar and
            our sacred storytellers share their transformative experiences,
            including those of:
          </p>
          a woman who meets a sister she never knew-child to child, soul to
          soul.a man whose animal ally gives him the gift of unconditional
          love.a woman who connects with the Amazigh women who served as oracles
          long ago.a granddaughter who conquers her fear and completes her first
          vision quest.a woman whose reverence and songs to Gaia bring much
          needed rain.a man who is protected from harm by sacred plant allies.
          <p>
            You must live the path to understand it. Cultivate spiritual
            discernment, learn how to consecrate your shamanic ceremonial space,
            practice an ancient Andean earth walk ritual, internalize the
            soul-nurturing beauty of Mother Earth with the Pachamama Renewal
            Process, work with the five principal animal allies of Universal
            Shamanism, and discover the loving grace that sparked the emergence
            of shamanism as a universal path of healing service.
          </p>
          <p>
            SHAMANISM is the medicine our world needs for seven generations and
            beyond.

          I found myself going to new levels of understanding, genuinely feeling
          mesmerized by his weaving of Shamanism and other wisdom traditions,
          including Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, cross-cultural shamanism,
          mythology, and western psychology. -Jose Luis Stevens, Ph.D.

          This fascinating book by don Oscar Miro-Quesada is filled with
          perennial wisdom teachings, and shamanic ritual practices meant to
          hasten our shift to a higher vibration, our birth into the life of
          Spirit transparent to itself in the material world. -Sandra Ingerman,

          Oscar Miro-Quesada speaks to us from his Heart Island - the cosmology
          and Earth-centered spiritual practices of Peru - to offer us ways of
          healing and knowing that can touch all peoples and help us reconnect

          don Oscar's words flow like a river, a river of thought, a song made
          of words, and it is music to my eyes. Grateful for this song that
          guides us back into shamanic reunion with a vastly sentient and sacred
          cosmos. -Joe Tafur M.D., author of The Fellowship of the River
