          • Explains in detail how the demotion or proved nonexistence of a
          planet marks the beginning of a roughly 30-year period in which that
          planet’s influence wanes <br /><br />• Explores Pluto’s arc of
          influence on individual and collective life in depth, from its
          discovery in 1930 to the end of its influence in 2036 <br /><br />•
          Offers examples from other demoted planets, such as Ceres, whose
          fifty-year reign as a planet corresponds very closely to the Romantic
          Era of history <br /><br />Recent research in astrology has shown that
          the discovery of a new planet correlates with the emergence of a new
          set of influences in individual and collective life. As John Michael
          Greer reveals, the opposite is also true: the demotion of a planet
          correlates with the decline of a set of influences into the
          background.<br /><br />Exploring the waxing and waning of planetary
          influences in astrology, Greer explains in detail how the demotion or
          proved nonexistence of a planet marks the beginning of a roughly
          30-year period in which that planet’s influence fades out. He examines
          several examples of planet demotion, including Ceres, whose influence
          began to take shape some 30 years before its discovery in 1801 and
          gradually faded over the three decades following its demotion in the
          1850s. <br /><br />Examining Pluto’s astrological influence in depth,
          from the beginning of the search for “Planet X” in 1900 to the end of
          its influence in 2036, the author shows how during the Plutonian era
          the concept of cosmos--from the ancient Greek meaning “that which is
          beautifully ordered”--was in eclipse. Pluto’s influence led to the
          rejection of unity, beauty, and order, exemplified through the
          splitting of the atom by physicists, the splitting of the individual
          into conscious and subconscious halves by psychoanalysts, and the
          splitting of the world into warring camps by politicians.
          <br /><br />Offering an essential guide not only to the astrology of
          the future but also to the twilight of the Plutonian era, Greer shows
          how as Pluto’s influence fades out in the years ahead, a great many
          disruptive phenomena of the recent past will fade with it.

          “In this relatively small volume, John Michael Greer accomplishes
          major feats, both intellectual and spiritual. Firstly, he has the
          scholarly wisdom to place planetary discoveries within the widest
          possible context, reminding us that the discovery of the visible
          planets is really the ‘Big Bang’ of Civilization. Then he masterfully
          applies the alchemical formula<i> solve et coagula</i> to break apart
          the more modern discoveries, purifying and distilling our
          understanding of them, before putting them back together into a
          hopeful new form, using the esoteric tools and cunning for which he’s
          well known. The result is medicine, in the truest sense of the word.”
