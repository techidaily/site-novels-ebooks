          <p>“I don’t have time to meditate!”</p>
          <p>
            Rebekah “Bex” Borucki has heard this a lot. A certified yoga and
            meditation teacher, she’s taught hundreds of thousands of people how
            to create simple yet powerful meditation practices. In fact, as
            she’ll show you in this book, in as little as <i>4 minutes</i>, you
            can change your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of suffering from anxiety and depression, both as a
            child and as an adult, Bex took control of her mental and physical
            health by establishing a rigorous fitness and yoga routine that
            quickly evolved into her own regular, homegrown 4-minute daily
            meditation practice. Bex’s 4-minute meditations combine mantras,
            affirmations, breathing and bodywork techniques, and they’re
            designed so that even the busiest people can fit them into their
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this book, Bex guides you through 27 different meditation
            practices, and shares personal stories that demonstrate how
            meditation has helped her overcome various challenges. She also
            answers commonly asked questions like
            <i>“Do my eyes have to stay closed?”</i> and
            <i>“What do I do if my body starts to hurt?”</i>; provides technical
            information about props, postures, and mantras; and offers tools to
            cope with complex issues such as grief, body acceptance, and
            relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            By spending just 4 minutes a day with this practice, you will find
            deep, meaningful, and lasting healing.

          "I love this book and its approach. It’s so easy to think that
          meditation needs to be difficult and that there’s no time to do it,
          and this book shatters that myth. Whatever challenge you’re facing, I
          know this book contains answers for you, and results you can
          experience in just a few (4) minutes."<br />— Nick Ortner, New York
          Times best-selling author of The Tapping Solution<br /><br />"Wow!
          This isn’t just a book. This is a journey. Rebekah’s beautiful
          personal story flows through these pages and I couldn’t help but feel
          so connected to her words like she was taking the words out of my
          mouth in numerous chapters. This book’s inspiring words are truly
          incredible and I recommend this book to anyone on the path to finding
          more peace within themselves. In a time when our world is stressed out
          and chaotic, this book is a beautiful reminder to go within and learn
          how to love yourself—something I needed many years ago before I
          started my journey to healing. I wish I had this book 10 years ago to
          help me navigate life because I’ve learned that true healing starts
          within. Thank you, Rebekah, for showing women how to let go, love
          themselves, and cultivate a radiant relationship with their inner
          selves. I am buying this book for all the women in my life."<br />—
          Amie Valpone, best-selling author of Eating Clean<br /><br />"Rebekah
          breaks down all the pathways to not simply meditating more, but also
          shares her busy-mother-of-five-tested practical and doable strategies
          to actually take the time to connect to yourself in a meaningful and
          consistent way. From where I stand, the hormonal balance benefits of
          this kind of doable stress management are game changing. Do this
          book."<br />— Alisa Vitti, functional nutritionist, founder of Flo
          Living and author of WomanCode<br /><br />"I love efficiency and
          feeling good. This book combines the two beautifully. It’s fun and so
          useful!"<br />— Kate Northrup, best-selling author of Money: A Love
          Story<br /><br />"What Rebekah shares in this book is heartfelt,
          inspiring, and effective. Her simple approach to meditation transcends
          the noise of spiritual trends and allows the reader to find true
          connection and healing in a way that works for real life."<br />—
          Robyn Youkilis, wellness expert and author of Go with Your Gut<br /><br />"A
          new, fresh perspective on an ancient practice, Rebekah brings a
          real-world, tried-and-tested approach to meditation. Hands down, I
          trust her advice and guidance on how to include meditation in a busy
          life. Loving, honest, and authentic, this book gives both new and
          experienced meditators direction on how to make meditation work."<br />—
          Alexandra Jamieson, co-creator of Super Size Me and author of Women,
          Food, and Desire<br /><br />"This is the most practical and
          busy-mom-friendly book on meditation I’ve ever read. Comprehensive,
          relatable, and easy to digest, these 4-minute meditations have the
          potential to shift your day, your energy, and your life."<br />—
          Meggan Watterson, author of Reveal and How to Love Yourself (and
          Sometime Other People) <br /><br />"Rebekah has the uncanny ability to
          tell it like it is in the most nurturing and uplifting way. She is
          whip-smart and quick witted with her feet firmly planted in reality.
          She is able to take age-old complex spiritual concepts and make them
          relatable, enjoyable, and easy to apply to your own life in any and
          all situations. Rebekah will become your best gal pal while leading
          you into a better version of yourself."<br />— Erin Stutland, wellness
          and fitness expert, author, and TV host<br /><br />"I am a big fan of
          Rebekah’s work. She does everything with a sense of playfulness and
          authenticity that’s contagious. I am a firm believer and practitioner
          of meditation, and I think that You Have 4 Minutes to Change Your Life
          is a great book for people who are looking for the best way to get
          started."<br />— Patricia Moreno, founder of Sati Life and the
          intenSati Method<br /><br />"You Have 4 Minutes to Change Your
          Life&nbsp;is a groundbreaking guide that&nbsp;demystifies and
          myth-busts meditation, making it accessible to everyone! This book is
          a potent partner on your journey to limitless self-love, courage, and
          joy.&nbsp;Let&nbsp;Rebekah Borucki lead you in creating a personal
          practice so inviting and transforming that you’ll find yourself
          looking for excuses&nbsp;to actually do it&nbsp;instead of get out of
          it!"<br />— Nancy Levin, author of Worthy<br /><br />"Reading this
          book is like sitting down with Rebekah, sharing a green smoothie, and
          getting all her best secrets to self-care. You really can change your
          life just 4 minutes at a time, and this book shows you not only how to
          do it, but also the incredible ways in which your life will expand
          when you do."<br />— Jennipher Walters, co-founder of Fit Bottomed
          Girls<br /><br />"Rebekah is the real deal. She is so genuine with
          everything she creates and this book is no exception."<br />— Katie
          Dalebout, author of Let It Out<br /><br />"Such a refreshing and
          relatable read.&nbsp;It’s amazing how Rebekah guides you to make
          nourishing, beautiful, and lasting changes in just four 4 minutes!"<br />—
          Christine Hassler, master coach, best-selling author of Expectation
          Hangover<br /><br />"Finally! A book that helps the ‘I want to
          meditate but can never make the time person’ feel completely at ease
          by realizing that meditation can fit into anyone’s life, and we can
          create our own rules without feeling like it’s necessary to devote an
          entire hour to peacefully sitting on the floor. I love how Rebekah
          breaks down meditations by the end result our bodies are craving and
          lays out optimal timing, locations, and positions, making it a
          no-brainer decision for me to pick up the book and meditate. After
          reading You Have 4 Minutes to Change Your Life, meditation is no
          longer a foreign concept that I once deemed appropriate only for yogis
          and crunchy-granola-type people, but rather, it’s become a daily habit
          that has and will impact my life for years to come. Thank you,
          Rebekah!"<br />— Amanda Morgan, clinical nutritionist<br /><br />"You
          Have 4 Minutes to Change Your Life is the perfect road map to the
          healing power of self-awareness and mindful meditation. Her story is
          one of regeneration and her methods are simple, accessible, and
          available to all of us! Through this book, we’re all able to
          experience possibility personified."<br />— Quentin Vennie, wellness
          expert and author of Strong in the Broken Places<br /><br />"Rebekah
          is a no-BS truth-teller who makes meditation fun and accessible for
          everyone. You Have 4 Minutes to Change Your Life is a true reflection
          of just that. If you’re new to meditation, this book is perfect for
          you and will become your new best friend. It will move you to your
          core and make you fall in love with meditating. If you’re a seasoned
          meditator, this book will help you press the reset button on your
          practice and see it from a fresh and powerful perspective. The
          simplest things are often most profound, and Bex truly teaches us this
          through this book."<br />— Heather Waxman, spiritual life coach,
          meditation guide, author of BODYpeace<br /><br />"Whether you are just
          beginning your meditation practice, fine-tuning the one you have, or
          searching for quick well-being solutions to heal your mind-set,
          Rebekah’s 4-minute meditations provide a platform for you."<br />—
          Rachel P. Goldstein, founder and CEO of Agent of Change<br /><br />"Rebekah
          shares from the heart in this inspirational, uplifting, yet practical
          guide that will no doubt change the lives of everyone who reads it.
          This book is truly the answer to the question, ‘How do I take care of
          myself when so many people are counting on me and I have no extra
          time?’ Thank you, Rebekah, for showing us the way to truly sustainable
          self-care in an age where it is so easy to put ourselves last."<br />—
          Grace Smith, celebrity hypnotherapist, founder of Grace Space, and
          author of Close Your Eyes, Get Free<br /><br />"I have admired
          Rebekah’s realness from the moment I met her. This woman shows up for
          her kids, her husband, and her business every single day with
          authenticity and joy. Showing us how she finds peace, calm, and
          capability amidst all that is a gift to us all."<br />— Elizabeth
          DiAlto, creator of Wild Soul Movement and author of Untame Yourself<br /><br />"Rebekah
          provides simple meditation techniques that can be implemented
          anywhere, at any time, by anyone. She has proven time and again that
          you only need 4 minutes to change your mood, your perspective—even
          your life. The strategies provided in&nbsp;You Have 4 Minutes to
          Change Your Life&nbsp;are tried and true, as Rebekah has shown us
          throughout her career. If you’ve experienced any level of stress,
          anxiety, grief, or heartbreak, you owe it to yourself to read this
          book."<br />— Gina Kirk, founder of Mom Life Must Haves<br /><br />"Rebekah
          Borucki is like a beacon of light for busy women everywhere! In her
          uniquely accessible book, Bex dispels the reasons for not trying
          meditation and shows you how to make meditation fit into your routine,
          so you can experience the power of this practice in your daily
          life."<br />— Nicole Jardim, certified women’s health coach and
          creator of Fix Your Period<br /><br />"This book transformed my
          meditation practice and in turn, my life. This is the quickest and
          most effective approach to incorporating mindfulness that I’ve ever
          encountered."<br />— Anna Gannon, yoga teacher
