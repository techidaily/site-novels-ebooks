          <p>
            Every creation begins as a thought, from a symphony to a marriage to
            an ice cream cone to a rocket launch. When we have an intention, a
            complex chain of events begins in our brains. Thoughts travel as
            electrical impulses along neural pathways. When neurons fire
            together they wire together, creating electromagnetic fields. These
            fields are invisible energy, yet they influence the molecules of
            matter around us the way a magnet organizes iron filings.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Mind to Matter</i>, award-winning researcher Dawson Church
            explains the science showing how our minds create matter. Different
            intentions produce different fields and different material
            creations. The thoughts and energy fields we cultivate in our minds
            condition the atoms and molecules around us. We can now trace the
            science behind each link in chain from thought to thing, showing the
            surprising ways in which our intentions create the material
            world.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The science in the book is illustrated by many authentic case
            histories of people who harnessed the extraordinary power of the
            mind to create. They include:
          </p>
          <p>
            • Adeline, whose Stage 4 cancer disappeared after she imagined
            "healing stars" <br />• Raymond Aaron and two of his clients, each
            of whom manifested $1 million in the same week<br />
            • Elon Musk, who bounced back from devastating tragedy to found
            Tesla and SpaceX <br />• Graham Phillips, who grew the emotional
            regulation part of his brain by 22.8% in two months <br />• Jennifer
            Graf, whose grandfather’s long-dead radio came to life to play love
            songs the day of her wedding <br />• Harold, whose 80% hearing loss
            reversed in an hour <br />• Joe Marana, whose deceased sister
            comforted him from beyond the grave <br />• Rick Geggie, whose
            clogged arteries cleared up the night before cardiac surgery <br />•
            Matthias Rust, a teen whose "airplane flight for peace" changed the
            fate of superpowers <br />• Wanda Burch, whose dream about cancer
            told the surgeon exactly where to look for it <br />• An MIT
            freshman student who can precipitate sodium crystals with his mind
            <br />• John, who found himself floating out of his body and
            returned to find his AIDS healed <br />• Dean, whose cortisol levels
            dropped by 48% in a single hour
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Mind to Matter</i>, Dawson Church shows that these outcomes
            aren’t a lucky accident only a few people experience.
            Neuroscientists have measured a specific brain wave formula that is
            linked to manifestation. This "flow state" can be learned and
            applied by anyone. New discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience,
            electromagnetism, psychology, vibration, and quantum physics connect
            each step in the process by which mind creates matter. They show
            that the whole universe is self-organizing, and when our minds are
            in a state of flow, they coordinate with nature's emergent
            intelligence to produce synchronous outcomes. The book contained
            over 150 photos and illustrations that explain the process, while an
            "Extended Play" section at the end of each chapter provides
            additional resources. As <i>Mind to Matter</i> drops each piece of
            the scientific puzzle into place, it leaves us with a profound
            understanding of the enormous creative potential of our minds. It
            also gives us a road map to cultivating these remarkable brain
            states in our daily lives.

          "If you’ve been wondering whether your thoughts really do affect your
          life, this marvelous book will make you a believer. From the level of
          the atom to the level of our bodies to the level of the galaxies,
          Dawson Church’s painstaking research shows that mind is profoundly
          creative. Synthesizing hundreds of studies in the fields of biology,
          physics, and psychology, he shows that moment by moment, the energy
          fields of our brains are literally creating reality. These insights
          can have a radical effect on your health and prosperity, and I highly
          recommend you apply them in your life."<br />— John Gray, #1 New York
          Times best-selling author of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from
          Venus<br /><br />"We have entered an era of healing in which the
          influence of consciousness in health and illness is being validated as
          never before. For a view of these crucial insights, researcher Dawson
          Church’s Mind to Matter is invaluable."<br />— Larry Dossey, M.D.,
          author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater
          Consciousness and Why It Matters<br /><br />"Dawson Church’s careful
          scientific work shows that the Law of Attraction isn’t just a
          metaphysical proposition—it’s a scientific reality. Drawing from
          hundreds of studies, and illustrated with inspiring real-life stories,
          it demystifies the intricate mechanisms by which thoughts become
          things. As the boundaries of what you believe is possible for your
          life are stretched by Dawson’s work, they may never snap back to their
          old shape."<br />— Marci Shimoff, #1 New York Times best-selling
          author of Happy for No Reason<br /><br />"I love this book. It
          constantly fascinated me with delicious facts and so many captivating
          stories. And it is wonderful to see science catching up with what the
          shamans and sages have always known!"<br />— Donna Eden, author of
          Energy Medicine<br /><br />"Once in a long while, a profoundly
          disruptive vision shatters the scientific paradigm, refocuses the
          entire way we see the world, and opens up vast new horizons of human
          potential. For our generation, this book is that vision."<br />—
          Raymond Aaron, New York Times best-selling author of Chicken Soup for
          the Parent’s Soul<br /><br />"Dawson Church has again proven himself
          to be one of the great thinkers of our time, demystifying the most
          complex principles in the universe that influence our lives, with a
          story-telling ability that makes it all fun and easy to understand. By
          weaving eye-opening research into engaging, heart-warming stories, an
          awareness emerges of the power your own mind has to not only direct
          your life but influence the collective consciousness of the universe
          itself which binds us together as one."<br />— Robert Hoss, co-author
          of Dreams That Change Our Lives; Director, DreamScience Foundation<br /><br />"This
          groundbreaking book presents the exciting new scientific evidence
          demonstrating that our thoughts have a direct impact on the world
          around us, and it shows us how to harness this knowledge for joyful
          and effective lives."<br />— David Feinstein, Ph.D., co-author of
          Personal Mythology<br /><br />"I believe that Mind to Matter is one of
          the most important books ever written. Chapter after chapter it shows
          us how we are masters of our bodies and the world around us. It’s
          filled with mind-blowing research that has completely changed the way
          I approach my life. The results I’m getting by applying the techniques
          are astonishing. They can transform your mind and the world of matter
          around you. I can’t recommend this book highly enough."<br />— Matt
          Gallant, author of Triple Your Productivity<br /><br />"Mind to Matter
          challenges the core principles of modern medicine and conventional
          science. Dawson Church makes a compelling case that the mind/body link
          is more profound than we ever suspected, and that science must expand
          its paradigm to include forces like consciousness, resonance, and
          energy. Profusely illustrated, the book includes an impressive
          compendium of research citations, from classic papers to recent
          breakthroughs. Many practical examples and exercises provide tools to
          work on our own personal transformation and, if the book’s thesis of
          interconnection is correct, our social transformation as well. I
          highly recommend this book."<br />— Eric Leskowitz, M.D., Department
          of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School<br /><br />"Dawson Church has
          been a pioneer in the field of healing for decades, his research far
          ahead of its time. His book Mind to Matter is perfectly timed for an
          era in which people are opening up to the science and research behind
          energy techniques. Dawson offers a brilliant and insightful guide to
          how our thoughts create our reality. Packed with fascinating history
          from the dawn of evolution to the latest brain research, his work is a
          blueprint for both experts and non-professionals looking for effective
          healing strategies. Dawson succinctly shows us not just that these
          methods work, but the empirical basis for how they work. If you have
          ever wanted to learn the science of manifestation and how your
          thoughts affect your material world, this book is a must-read. It will
          change your thoughts, and applying these principles every day will in
          turn change your reality. The question is—what will you create after
          you read it?"<br />— Peta Stapleton, Ph.D., School of Psychology, Bond
          University, Australia<br /><br />"Many in our culture are shifting
          from powerless victims to powerful co-creators. Yet as this
          evolutionary impulse toward greater power emerges, we are coming face
          to face with what happens when power is abused. As we face global
          crises of unpredictable proportions, we need heart-based creators of
          deep integrity in touch with their power now more than ever. What
          would be possible in our lives and on our planet if we connected our
          power with our hearts? What does science have to say about such
          manifesting power? Mind to Matter explores this edge of how our power
          to participate in the co-creation of reality functions from the
          scientific perspective. It also calls us out on how to avoid
          overstating our human power, as so many ‘law of attraction’ books
          mistakenly promise. As our power grows, we are called to acknowledge
          with humility the paradoxical nature of how powerful we are as
          creators, yet how uncontrollable the great Mystery really is. May
          those who read this book step fully into their power, their hearts,
          and their integrity, and may the world be blessed by how this book
          affects you."<br />— Lissa Rankin, M.D., New York Times best-selling
