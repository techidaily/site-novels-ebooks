          Consulting plant spirits for spiritual and psychological guidance and
          healing <br />
          <br />• Reveals how, by communing with the deva or spirit of a plant,
          we can call forth its medicine without even needing to ingest it
          <br />
          <br />• Includes wisdom from the devas of 13 herbs, such as rosemary,
          datura, and uva ursi <br />
          <br />• Empowers readers with the tools to develop their own inner
          resources for healing in relationship with the plant devas around them
          <br />
          <br />Each plant has a story to share with us, a healing story to
          guide us in trying times, a spirit medicine for the New Earth that is
          presently unfolding. Herbs are some of the most powerful allies we
          have for these transitional times--we just need to learn how to listen
          as they share their knowledge with us. <br />
          <br />In <i>Wisdom of the Plant Devas</i>, Thea Summer Deer reveals a
          new dimension of herbal medicine, one where the plant’s spirit is
          consulted for guidance and healing beyond the physical. Examining the
          botany, modern and traditional uses, history, and folklore of 13
          special herbs, such as rosemary, uva ursi, and datura, she shares
          divinations and messages from their devas, or plant spirits,
          explaining how these stories carry the herbs into our lives, letting
          them work their magic on us. Exploring herbal medicine from an
          energetic perspective, she reveals that by communing with the deva of
          a plant, we can call on the plant’s physical, psychological, and
          spiritual medicine and guidance--without ingesting it or even being in
          its presence. <br />
          <br />Detailing the sacred space of a Medicine Wheel Garden, whether
          in a backyard or our imaginations, she connects us with the devas and
          empowers us to seek our own answers with their much-needed spiritual
          guidance and divinatory advice. Creating a bridge between botanical
          medicine and plant spirit medicine, she shows how by coming into
          community with the devas and co-creating with the world of nature, we
          can gain tremendous insights to help heal our hearts, our minds, and
          our spirits and consciously evolve as together we birth the New Earth.
