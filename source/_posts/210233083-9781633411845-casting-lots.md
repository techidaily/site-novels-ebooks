            &nbsp;<br />
            Lots are an ancient Hebrew form of divination and magic that may
            also be used for healing, blessing, cursing, meditation, and
            spiritual interaction. A set of lots contains twenty-two small
            discs, each one bearing one of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew
            alphabet. In a manner similar to runes, these lots are then cast and
            interpreted. Though lots were once so common that explanations of
            how to cast them were unnecessary, over the centuries their methods
            and uses fell into obscurity.<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            In this practical guide, author and seer Elisheva Nesher has
            reconstructed the ancient art of lot casting for modern times. Her
            book contains explanations for each of the twenty-two lots and
            explores their meanings, both mystical and mundane. It also includes
            detailed instructions on how to cast, as well as craft your own set
            of lots. In addition to divination, <i>Casting Lots </i>explores the
            magical gifts of the lots as well as how to use them to contact and
            interact with the Hebrew spirits, such as Asherah. A brief guide is
            included for those unfamiliar with these spirits.<br />
            &nbsp;<br /><i>Casting Lots</i> is a complete instruction manual for
            mastering the art of lot casting.
