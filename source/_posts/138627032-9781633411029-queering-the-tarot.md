            Tarot is best used as a tool for self-discovery, healing, growth,
            empowerment, and liberation. Tarot archetypes provide the reader
            with a window into present circumstances and future potential. But
            what if that window only opened up on a world that was white,
            European, and heterosexual? The interpretations of the tarot that
            have been passed down through tradition presuppose a commonality and
            normalcy among humanity. At the root of card meanings are archetypes
            that we accept without questioning. But at what point do archetypes
            become stereotypes?

            Humanity is diverse--culturally, spiritually, sexually. Tarot has
            the power to serve a greater population, with the right keys to
            unlock the tarot's deeper meanings. In <i>Queering the Tarot</i>,
            Cassandra Snow deconstructs the meanings of the 78 cards explaining
            the ways in which each card might be interpreted against the norm.
            <i>Queering the Tarot</i> explores themes of sexuality, coming out,
            gender and gender-queering, sources of oppression and empowerment,
            and many other topics especially familiar to not-straight folks.
            Cassandra's identity-based approach speaks directly to those whose
            identity is either up in the air or consuming the forefront of their
            consciousness. It also speaks to those struggling with mental
            illness or the effects of trauma, all seekers looking for personal
            affirmation that who they are is okay.

          "As a straight, middle-class Baby Boomer, I admit to being slightly
          uncomfortable with the word “queer”. It is also true that I have made
          up my mind not to die of mental rigidity. So a few years back, I began
          consciously trying on other people’s perspectives and I have come to
          understand that the LBGTQ+ community speaks the word clearly as a
          powerful badge of honor. For the moment, as Beth Maiden points out in
          her brilliant foreword to this book, the queer experience is
          substantially different from the hetero experience. Both from that
          perspective, and from the perspective of a long time student of all
          things tarot, I herald the release of this book and the new dimensions
          that it adds to the magical symbolism of the cards. In the
          page-and-a-half “Word” that follows Maiden’s “Foreword”, Cassandra
          Snow says that the word “queer” has come to mean the intention to
          create a community where “others” (all those who need a safer space)
          are welcomed with open arms. I can think of no better definition of
          the symbolism of the tarot. Snow is asking The Fool to “walk in
          another man’s shoes” along the path to enlightenment. The lessons
          learned are invaluable." --<b>Anna Jedrziewski</b>, Retailing
