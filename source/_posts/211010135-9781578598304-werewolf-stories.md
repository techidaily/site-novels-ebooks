          “… <i>Werewolf Stories</i> is the latest compilation of stories and
          research by intrepid researcher Nick Redfern, along with research
          contributed by the late Brad Steiger. The accounts and anecdotes
          assembled for this book are entertaining, intriguing, and downright
          terrifying. This is another excellent offering from the prolific
          Redfern.” —<i>Los Angeles Book Review</i><br /><br />“… the stories in
          <i>Werewolf Stories</i> read like stories instead of encyclopedia
          articles, which makes much of it good fun to read for spooky-tale
          aficionados, whether you're the kind who believes such things could be
          true or the kind who lives with your paws on planet Earth.” —<i
            >Psychobabble</i
          ><br /><br />“… a thought-provoking book on the werewolf mythology. …
          The knowledge that pours out from Nick Redfern and the late Brad
          Steiger on werewolves is mind staggering. If you want to go beyond
          Hollywood's version of werewolves, I would highly suggest that you
          pick up this masterpiece book and get an in depth look at these
          monsters!” —<i>Unexplained-Mysteries.com</i><br /><br />“… book takes
          readers on a journey that spans centuries. … learn about real people
          who claimed to be werewolves and folks who could manifest otherworldly
          beasts. Learn about werewolf hunters, werewolf experts, and different
          kinds of canine-like beasties. And then keep going and find out why
          you probably shouldn’t go into the woods alone in the dark. Duh, like
          you need to be told. …” —<i>Keizertimes</i><br /><br />“The 1930s
          brought us Lon Chaney Jr. as the classic <i>Wolf Man</i>. Decades
          later, Rick Baker’s far more advanced special effects gave us
          <i>An American Werewolf in London</i>. And our Hollywood werewolves
          have only gotten more sophisticated and terrifying. But centuries
          earlier, there was Gilles Garnier, who in 1572 was accused of being a
          real-life werewolf. With real horror. And real victims. … As
          <i>Werewolf Stories</i> recounts, “Garnier … ‘being in the form of a
          wolf,’ seized a ten-year-old girl in a vineyard and ‘there he slew her
          with both hands, seemingly paws, and with his teeth carried some of
          her flesh home to his wife.’” This is just one of many lycanthropic
          tales spanning the course of humanity presented in
          <i>Werewolf Stories</i>. Others include exorcisms that freed the
          possessed from evil werewolf spirits, serial killers who believed they
          were werewolves and modeled their crimes on them, the Ouija Wolf Girl
          who was cursed by a spirit, and even werecats. … The collection was
          culled from Redfern’s research and from the prolific cryptozoology
          files of Steiger, who passed away in 2018 at the age of 82. …” —<i
