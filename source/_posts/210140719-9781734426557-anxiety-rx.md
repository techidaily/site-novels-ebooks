              >On February 8, 2013, I was a highly anxious and burned-out
              fifty-two-year-old physician. That night, as I left my clinic in
              my usual chronic state of anxiety, I wondered if life was worth
              living. But I had to be onstage as a stand-up comedian an hour
              later, so killing myself would have to wait. However, I never got
              to the comedy club. I suffered an injury that night that would end
              my medical career.</span

              >I've dealt with anxiety since I was a teenager. My father was
              schizophrenic and bipolar, and the chaos and pain of his illness
              created tremendous alarm in my system. My mother did her best to
              love and take care of my brother and me, but she had her own issue
              with chronic anxiety. I often say my mother was neurotic and my
              father was psychotic, so my psyche didn't stand much of a
              chance!</span

              >I wrote this book to make my father's suicide and the suffering
              of my family mean something: to help others who experienced
              chronic worry to understand and fix the pain that is sucking the
              life out of them. I have degrees and advanced training in
              medicine, neuroscience, and developmental psychology, but much of
              what I'll share came out of my experiences in very unscientific
              places. This book is a unique blend of hard neuroscience and soft
              spirit.</span

              >For over thirty years, I searched for relief from anxiety and saw
              practitioners ranging from Indian shamanic energy healers to
              highly accomplished psychiatrists. (I was lucky I was a doctor so
              I could afford to be a patient.) Have you, too, gone to
              extraordinary lengths to resolve your chronic compulsion to worry
              and are still suffering? Read on.</span

              >What makes this book different is a relentless focus on calming
              anxiety at its true source, which I will share with you in detail.
              That source is in a place most doctors and psychologists fail to
              explore, and that oversight is why the positive effects of most
              anxiety therapies tend to wear off over time.</span

              unique, novel, and effective. This is my life's work and the
              ultimate book of high-impact solutions for escaping the trap of
              chronic worry. I truly do not want you to suffer as I have!</span
