          A detailed guide to awakening your powers of supersensory perception
          <br /><br />• Details methods and techniques for the acquisition of
          supersensory powers distilled from Rudolf Steiner’s 400 published
          volumes and from Patañjali’s <i>Yoga Sutra</i> <br /><br />• Explores
          acquisition of these powers at birth (genetic) and through entheogens,
          mantra and prayer, effort and exercise, and nondual meditation
          <br /><br />• Includes a map of consciousness based on the work of
          neuroscientist Karl Pribram and physicist David Bohm
          <br /><br />According to philosopher Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), there
          exists within every human being the potential for developing
          supersensory powers and, with these powers activated, the ability to
          awaken the higher self and attain knowledge of non-physical higher
          worlds. Steiner himself worked diligently throughout his life to
          develop his faculties of “supersensible perception” and, scattered
          throughout his many works, he describes methods by which to activate
          and operate these supersensory-cognitive systems.
          <br /><br />Distilling techniques from Steiner’s more than 400
          published volumes, Shelli Renée Joye, Ph.D., presents a practical,
          modern approach to acquiring, cultivating, and maintaining
          supersensible perception and developing higher consciousness. The five
          approaches she studies include acquisition by birth (genetic),
          entheogens, mantra and prayer, effort and exercise, and
          Samadhi--equated by many with nondual awareness. Adding another
          dimension to Steiner’s methods, the author shows how these steps are
          powerfully aligned with 4th-century South Indian sage Patañjali’s
          teachings in the <i>Yoga Sutra</i>. <br /><br />The author explores
          how to develop what you have acquired through imaginative, active, or
          intuitive thinking, as well as how to learn through inner guidance and
          how to transform knowledge gained from books into spiritual
          advancement. She also shares her own extraordinary experiences of
          supersensory networks of consciousness. <br /><br />Connecting
          Steiner’s ideas to modern advances in quantum physics, psychedelic
          science, and consciousness studies, Dr. Joye shows how each of us is
          capable of developing supersensible perception and expanding our
          awareness to connect with cosmic consciousness.

          “. . . a clearly written comparison of Western (Steiner) and Eastern
          (Patañjali) approaches to developing ‘supersensory powers,’ an ability
          said to allow one to perceive domains far beyond the ordinary,
          including the esoteric realms called the astral and the etheric.
          Shelli Joye shows that surprisingly these two mystics were describing
          the same underlying methods. But what is unique about this book is the
          appendix in which Joye applies modern scientific concepts to help
          explain what ‘supersensory’ might mean. An intriguing work, well worth
          reading.”
