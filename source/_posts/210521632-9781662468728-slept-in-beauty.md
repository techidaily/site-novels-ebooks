            Slept in Beauty is a description relating to a young girl going into
            a deep sleep at four years old after being raped and sodomized. The
            body of the young girl continued to grow and live through thirteen
            years of horrific abuse; all the while, the young four-year-old girl
            slept in memory, feeling protected in that sleep, knowing that one
            day she would wake. She was told to be quiet at every turn, and her
            voice was silenced. Her family moved from city to city and state to
            state as the family secret continued, and the little girl kept her
            voice in silence regarding her experiences. On the outside, one
            would think she was fine and she would say she was, but the truth is
            she was broken and could not see a way out. This girl did well in
            school, joined in groups including cheerleading, choir, and drama,
            all the while keeping the little girl asleep so no one would ever
            know the truth. As she got older into her teens and could start to
            think of a future on her own, she started to see that there could be
            a way toward independence and escape.

            During her last year in high school, a major change came in the form
            of another student who used American Sign Language to communicate as
            she was deaf. This language intrigued the young woman as a voice
            within her began to stir. Using American Sign Language had no sound,
            but the communication could be understood nonetheless. Would it be
            possible to speak from the silence using these signs, body language,
            facial expression, and posture? Yes, it was possible and would come
            to fruition. As this young woman learned sign language, the voice
            within began to scream to be heard. One day it all came out.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The signing of the trauma, the cries, the tears, the questions, the
            pain and hurt all came out without a voice heard. The four year old
            was now seventeen, and her voice was finally heard. American Sign
            Language allowed her to say what could not be said with sound and
            gave her a voice to live in the truth. Why “slept in beauty”?
            Because she was protected in that state, and as the scripture of
            Isaiah 61:3 says, He will give us beauty for ashes in finding good
            in the midst of so much evil. Her life is a culmination of these
            events, and her voice is loud and clear now as she advocates on
            behalf of those who have no voice.
