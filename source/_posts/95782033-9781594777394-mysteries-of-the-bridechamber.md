          Jesus was an initiate and adept of the ancient Judaic mysteries who
          strove to reinstate the tradition of the bridechamber sacrament in his
          time <br /><br />• Shows that Jesus sought to establish equity of
          masculine and feminine in both spiritual practice and social
          traditions, particularly in the sacrament of marriage <br /><br />•
          Reinterprets Jesus’ key teachings in light of the ancient tradition of
          sacred consortship <br /><br />• Reveals what happened to the gnostic
          heart of Christianity that Jesus embodied <br /><br />Jesus was a
          high-initiate and master adept of the ancient Judaic mysteries who
          strove to free people from the dead hand of the ritualists. He was
          trained in a dissident Jewish brotherhood that arose in Egypt before
          he was born, which sought to bring back the ancient Judaic mysteries
          outlawed by the Jerusalem temple. At the heart of this movement was a
          yogic-based practice known in the apocrypha as the Gnosis of the
          Heart, which espoused the union of both sexes in a secret initiatic
          teaching.<br /><br />As a fearless social reformer, Jesus wanted to
          restore the authority of the feminine principle, including asserting
          the equality of man and woman in the social contract of marriage. He
          reinstated in his own life the tradition of sacred consortship--a rite
          known to early Church fathers as the bridechamber sacrament, whereby
          the marriage of the masculine and feminine energies was effected. This
          rite, Victoria LePage suggests, was the primary focus of Jesus’
          teachings, the very heart of his exhortations to love thy neighbor,
          and the source of his healing power. <br /><br /><i
            >Mysteries of the Bridechamber </i
          >explains how, as a master adept of the Temple of Solomon, Jesus
          derived these teachings directly from ancient Judaic mystery
          traditions, revealing both a life story for Jesus that differs
          markedly from the version the Church has offered as well as a
          spiritual practice based on a mystical wisdom tradition of
          self-initiation and transformation.
