          <i>Entheogens and the Development of Culture </i>makes the radical
          proposition that mind-altering substances have played a major part not
          only in cultural development but also in human brain development.
          Researchers suggest that we have purposely enhanced receptor sites in
          the brain, especially those for dopamine and serotonin, through the
          use of plants and fungi over a long period of time. The trade-off for
          lowered functioning and potential drug abuse has been more creative
          thinking--or a leap in consciousness. Experiments in entheogen use led
          to the development of primitive medicine, in which certain
          mind-altering plants and fungi were imbibed to still fatigue, pain, or
          depression, while others were taken to promote hunger and libido. Our
          ancestors selected for our neural hardware, and our propensity for
          seeking altered forms of consciousness as a survival strategy may be
          intimately bound to our decision-making processes going back to the
          dawn of time.<br /><br />Fourteen essays by a wide range of
          contributors—including founding president of the American
          Anthropological Association’s Anthropology of Religion section Michael
          Winkelman, PhD; Carl A. P. Ruck, PhD, Boston University professor of
          classics and an authority on the ecstatic rituals of the god Dionysus;
          and world-renowned botanist Dr. Gaston Guzma, member of the Colombian
          National Academy of Sciences and expert on hallucinogenic
          mushrooms—demonstrate that altering consciousness continues to be an
          important part of human experience today. Anthropologists, cultural
          historians, and anyone interested in the effects of mind-altering
          substances on the human mind and soul will find this book deeply
          informative and inspiring.
