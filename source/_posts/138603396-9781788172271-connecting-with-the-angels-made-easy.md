          are miracle-workers. So, welcome their help and allow them to be your
          new role models and guides. They won’t have you wearing some crazy
          fashion accessory, but they will change you.<br /><br />"They’ll
          remove the barriers around your heart and help you align with your
          true self– the self that loves and is loved.<br /><br />"Fears and old
          beliefs will prevent you from making a direct connection with your
          angels, and are reasons why many people don’t experience the angels’
          love and support.<br /><br />"This is why I’m encouraging you to let
          go of the old and let in the love. This is why you’re making room!
          You’re clearing out the challenging stuff and making room for the
          loving stuff!<br /><br />"You’ve been called to this book for a
          reason. Probably because you’re ready to make some sort of change in
          your life and you’d like to think there’s help out there for you.<br /><br />"Well,
          the good news is you’ve come to the right place and the exciting part
          of it is that there’s greater support than you know just waiting to
          help you. Take time to soak that up.”<br /><br />Love,<br />Kyle

          <b>Kyle Gray</b> is one of the UK's youngest, most sought after angel
          experts. He discovered his spiritual connection at the tender age of
          four, when he communed with his deceased grandmother. Since then, he
          has been blessed with a strong connection to the angels, who have
          guided him as he developed his intuitive gifts. After years of hiding
          his abilities, Kyle was called to share the angels' incredible
          messages with the world. Now, Kyle dedicates his life to helping other
          people crack open to the angels through his workshops, talks and his
          online Angel Team. He is the author of seven books and co-creator of
          four oracle card decks. <b>www.kylegray.co.uk</b>
