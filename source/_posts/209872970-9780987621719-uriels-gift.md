            "I died on the17th July 1996 - life became very interesting after
            that."
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, in the middle of a car accident I found myself with Jesus,
            Archangel Uriel, and a third spiritual presence looking down at my
            body still strapped inside the wreck of my car.
          </p>
          <p>
            They showed me my life, where I was up to, and how this life
            connects to past and future lives, then they offered me a choice:
            stay with them or go back to my physical life and share my story.
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose to return and when I did&nbsp;I woke to pain, a vision of my
            Lifeline, and the promise of a new beginning that would be more
            wonderful and exciting than anything I had ever experienced in my
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            A little while later during meditation, Archangel Uriel came to me
            and presented me with a gift. It was a book, and when I opened it I
            found every single page to be totally blank. I asked Uriel: "What's
            supposed to go in the book?"
          </p>
          <p>
            He said: "Your experiences. Fill it with the things you see on your
            journey."
          </p>
          <p>
            Two weeks after that and again in meditation, Jesus came to me. I
            asked him: "Why are you here?" He looked at me with laughter in his
            eyes and said: "Write your book. All the answers are in it."
          </p>
          <p>
            He let me think about that for a bit and then said: "I have been
            with you always, and I will be with you always. I am always with
            you. I do not want you to follow me, nor will I follow you, although
            I will always walk beside you. I will teach &nbsp;you through
            visions and dreams, through meditations like this one, and through
            astral travel. Put the things that you see on your journey into your
            book. As you write, the answers you seek will come to you. For now,
            take my hand and walk with me."
          </p>
          <p>
            Uriel's Gift is not just for me, it's for anyone who chooses to
            delve into it.
