            It was an irrational decision. Despite having just moved into a
            beautiful new house, the Williams family gave in to an odd,
            overwhelming desire to purchase and move into a Victorian home they
            had come upon by chance. They were curious, of course, as to why the
            house had in the past had such a high vacancy rate. But that
            curiosity didn’t last long, because shortly after moving in, strange
            things began to happen. At first the family tried telling themselves
            there were logical explanations for the strange things they all were
            witnessing. But before long they came to accept the fact that they
            were sharing their home with ghosts. <i>Haunted</i> is the Williams
            family’s story from the point of view of the mother, Dorah. Through
            her chilling reminiscences, we witness the all-too-real goings-on in
            the house.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon writing <i>Haunted</i>, Dorah thought her situation was unique.
            What she didn’t realize was how many others would relate to how it
            feels to be haunted, too. After being flooded by emails from people
            with similar experiences, Dorah began to realize this wasn’t
            uncommon at all. So <i>Haunted Too</i> came to be. Not only will it
            entertain the reader, as good ghost stories always have, but it will
            also help the reader to better understand this phenomenon, with the
            inclusion of shared experiences, opinions, and advice of
            professionals in this field.
