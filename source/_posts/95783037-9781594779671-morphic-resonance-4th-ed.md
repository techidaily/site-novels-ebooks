          New updated and expanded edition of the groundbreaking book that
          ignited a firestorm in the scientific world with its radical approach
          to evolution <br />
          <br />• Explains how past forms and behaviors of organisms determine
          those of similar organisms in the present through morphic resonance
          <br />
          <br />• Reveals the nonmaterial connections that allow direct
          communication across time and space <br />
          <br />When <i>A New Science of Life</i> was first published the
          British journal <i>Nature</i> called it “the best candidate for
          burning there has been for many years.” The book called into question
          the prevailing mechanistic theory of life when its author, Rupert
          Sheldrake, a former research fellow of the Royal Society, proposed
          that morphogenetic fields are responsible for the characteristic form
          and organization of systems in biology, chemistry, and physics--and
          that they have measurable physical effects. Using his theory of
          morphic resonance, Sheldrake was able to reinterpret the regularities
          of nature as being more like habits than immutable laws, offering a
          new understanding of life and consciousness. <br />
          <br />In the years since its first publication, Sheldrake has
          continued his research to demonstrate that the past forms and behavior
          of organisms influence present organisms through direct immaterial
          connections across time and space. This can explain why new chemicals
          become easier to crystallize all over the world the more often their
          crystals have already formed, and why when laboratory rats have
          learned how to navigate a maze in one place, rats elsewhere appear to
          learn it more easily. With more than two decades of new research and
          data, Rupert Sheldrake makes an even stronger case for the validity of
          the theory of formative causation that can radically transform how we
          see our world and our future.

          "Sheldrake's theories continue to gain verification, and this book is
          particularly important because its implications affect the way we view
          the natural world, as well as ourselves, as one small part of it.
          <i>Morphic Resonance</i> is therefore strongly recommended to anyone
          interested in understanding current thought about what may lie behind
          the formation of all natural systems."
