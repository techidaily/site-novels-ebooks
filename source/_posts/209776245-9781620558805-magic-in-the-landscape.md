          Learn to cultivate a traditional, beneficial relationship with the
          land by embracing the forgotten practices of our ancestors
          <br /><br />• Details the ancient art of geomancy and Earth magic,
          including how to work with ley lines, astrology, and the four
          directions to honor a space and make it a place of power <br /><br />•
          Explores the magic of the land around us and how our ancestors
          interacted with Earth energies and the forces of Nature <br /><br />•
          Discusses the power of boundaries and magic circles, the proper “feng
          shui” of graveyards and cemeteries, and magically powerful places such
          as crossroads, fairgrounds, and the mystic triangles found in
          “no-man’s lands” <br /><br />Our ancestors were deeply aware of the
          magical power of their local landscape, no matter where they lived.
          Every interaction with their environment--from building to farming to
          the layout of ancient cities--took into account terrestrial energies,
          ancestral memory, and the many seen and unseen presences in Nature.
          They developed sophisticated procedures for orienting their living
          spaces and respectfully working with the magic of the landscape. Yet,
          much of the art of geomancy and of working with the forces of Nature
          has been forgotten by modern builders, architects, foresters,
          gardeners, and homeowners. The treatment of land as mere property has
          led to a loss of its meaning for those who dwell upon it. Our
          landscape has become disenchanted. <br /><br />In this book, geomancy
          expert and scholar Nigel Pennick details the ancient and sacred
          practices of geomancy and Earth magic and reveals how we can reenchant
          and reconnect to the sacred landscape that surrounds us, whether you
          live rurally, in the suburbs, or in cities. Pennick begins with a
          vivid look at our modern “wasteland” and what he calls “the ensouled
          world,” with specific examples from Britain and Iceland of our
          ancestors’ way of perceiving the world they lived in. Exploring the
          art of geomancy, he examines how its techniques work with ley lines,
          astrology, and the old understanding of the four directions and the
          eight winds to honor a space and make it a place of power. He looks at
          the power of boundaries and magic circles, including laying ghosts and
          dismissing spirits, as well as the proper “feng shui” for cemeteries
          and graveyards. The author then takes the reader back into the
          traditional landscape to discuss magically powerful places, such as
          crossroads, the occult nature of the “fairground,” and the mystic
          triangles found in what are popularly known as “no-man’s lands.”
          <br /><br />Revealing how the landscape can be reenchanted, Pennick
          shows how the magic of place is a living system that each of us can
          interact with.
