          ><b>, and the path to enlightenment</b><br /><br />
          Two and a half decades ago, Ascended Master Teachers Arten and Pursah
          appeared to&nbsp;Gary Renard&nbsp;and held a series of conversations
          with him that elaborated on the teachings of two spiritual classics,
          <i>The Gospel of Thomas</i> and <i>A Course in Miracles</i>. Gary
          immortalized what he learned in the books of his best-selling series:
          <i>The Disappearance of the Universe, Your Immortal Reality</i>, and
          <i>Love Has Forgotten No One</i>. This fourth book is a companion to
          the original trilogy, yet written to stand alone—an invitation for new
          readers into this fascinating work.<br /><br />
          This book explores six of the lifetimes in which the incarnations of
          Jesus and Buddha lived together, beginning in 700 B.C. when they were
          known as Saka and Hiroji. Through the spiritual lessons that Jesus and
          Buddha learn on their path, Arten and Pursah clarify the difference
          between duality and nonduality. When you are able to internalize these
          lessons, you will be saved countless years in your spiritual
          development.

          "This book is shocking, and that's what I like about it. How did Jesus
          become the Christ and how did the Buddha attain Buddhahood? Are their
          stories somehow connected? These are just a few of the questions that
          Gary Renard and his teachers, Arten and Pursah, pursue in this book.
          At the very least, they challenge our willingness to consider the
          impact these masters can have on our lives today, not just in ancient
          times. I really think you're going to enjoy this journey."<br />—
          James F. Twyman, best-selling author of The Moses Code and Emissary of
          Light<br /><br />"Arten and Pursah are back and better than ever, with
          their uncompromising message and pull-no-punches attitude, all the
          while reinforcing the importance of seeing in the light of pure
          nondualism. Additionally, they share with us a very intriguing and
          pleasantly surprising historical connection between Jesus and Buddha
          that the world doesn’t even know about! Gary is his usual humorous
          self, and as always, candidly shares his forgiveness opportunities
          that we can all learn from. Giddy up!"<br />— Mike Lemieux, author of
          Dude, Where’s My Jesus Fish?
