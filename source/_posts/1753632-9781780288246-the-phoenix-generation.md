          <p>
            According to futurist and sociologist, Kingsley L. Dennis, humanity
            is entering a momentous phase in its history. Being born today is a
            generation of children that will radically reinvent human society,
            moving our culture from competition, control, and censorship toward
            connection, communication, and compassion. The Phoenix Generation's
            impact will begin to be felt in 2030, but there much to do to
            prepare for their arrival.<br /><br />The book is divided into three
            parts. Part one briefly describes the thorny issues (e.g. global
            warming, nationalism, and food and water shortages) that the
            solution-oriented ways of the Phoenix will resolve. Dennis posits
            that the generations of adults living today are the bridge to the
            Phoenix and he shows how such developments as the worldwide web and
            the explosion of mobile technologies are paving the way for them.
            Part two describes the changes in our own consciousness being
            brought about by technology and what we need to do to speed their
            arrival. Part three gives details how the Phoenix generation will be
            different from us. <br /><br />The Phoenix Generation will work
            toward forming a planetary society a transition more radical than
            the shift from agrarian to urban life during the Industrial
            Revolution. These children are being born with increased instinctive
            intelligence and with a greater degree of inherited wisdom. With
            them, the quantum revolution begun 100 years ago will become
            mainstream. This will bring about a shift away from external
            dependencies (e.g. our dependency on higher education for career
            advancement). This normalizing of new perspectives, cosmic
            awareness, and of multi-dimensional realities will usher in a great
            wave of change. The Phoenix Generation is a deeply positive
            examination of our collective future.

          Kingsley Dennis and I seem to be writing the same books with slightly
          different filters, and it’s very interesting to see the transformation
          through his eyes. I love the detailed way he outlines the process of
          the shift in consciousness, with clear description of the stages and
          symptoms. I also love that he is able “to turn a phrase,” to say
          something from a new angle that just clicks an understanding into
          place. In addition, Dennis takes time to intuitively examine the
          transformed shape and function of specific arenas like politics,
          education, media, and medicine. This is such a big help for us in
          imagining how the new reality will feel. Excellent job!<br />&nbsp;—Penney
          Peirce, expert intuitive and author of <i>Leap of Perception,</i>
          <i>Frequency, and The Intuitive Way</i><br /><br /><br />A new phase
          in human history is in the making, one that is as inevitable as
          tomorrow's sunrise. Kingsley Dennis sees this new dawn clearly. The
          Phoenix Generation is a blueprint for tomorrow -- a vision of renewed
          meaning, hope and optimism.<br />-Larry Dossey, MD, Author of One
          Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of a Greater Consciousness and
          Why It Matters
        </p>
        <p>
          Kingsley Dennis has dialed into our collective emergence by laying out
          the complex evolutionary assignment for the rising generation and then
          revealing their capacity to lead us into a thriving planetary
          civilization. A thrilling peek at the curriculum for a new
          humanity!<br />-James O'Dea, Award winning author of Cultivating Peace
          and former President of The Institute of Noetic Sciences.

          Finally! A book that puts a thoughtfully positive and powerful face on
          the future, The Phoenix Generation reveals a new narrative for an
          rapidly evolving species—a narrative that rethinks world systems and
          world mythologies and tells the tale of a collaborative future where
          feminine and masculine energies are balanced and values of love,
          compassion, mutual support and tolerance are part of the living
          intelligence guiding our lives.<br />&nbsp;- Cate Montana, author

        <p>
          Rarely do we hear a clarion call of hope and engagement resonate so
          deeply in the human heart as does The Phoenix Generation by Kingsley
          L. Dennis. A timely, hopeful and engaging book, an important guide for
          the new era that awaits us.<br />-Jim Conlon, PhD, Holy Names
          University/Sophia Center

          Kingsley Dennis has a remarkable gift: he writes about topics that go
          beyond our everyday horizons but writes so clearly that they appear to
          be directly in front of us - as indeed, the transition that is the
          underlying topic of this book, truly is. To ground and balance the
          Phoenix Generation is an epochal mission - perhaps the most important
          educational task we could undertake today, and could ever have
          undertaken in humankind's eventful history. This book tells us why
          this is so, and how we could live up to it. It is a "must read" for
          everyone concerned with our future, and aware of our moral and
          all-human obligation to do our best to make it a future of
          breakthrough rather than of breakdown.<br />-Ervin Laszlo, Author of
          <i>Science and the Akashic Field</i><br /><br /><br />The scope of
          <i>The Phoenix Generation</i>, which is addressed to those of us who
          are the bridge generation between the old paradigm and the one already
          starting to come in, is nothing short of the future of our species on
          planet Earth. Dennis dedicates this book to the Phoenix Generation
          itself, for knowing who they are and what they have to do – even if
          they are not necessarily the ones who will read his book.<br /><br />This
          book, amazingly readable, accessible and exciting, is a comprehensive
          exploration of 3 things: the issues concerning our current, outworn
          mindset; the nature of the emerging consciousness and human values;
          and the changes we will see when the intuitive, multi-dimensional
          awareness of the coming generations come into play. How this man has
          covered all of this successfully in under 200 pages is a mystery to
          me! But that is the nature of this new world we are entering. Perhaps
          Kingsley Dennis is himself a representative of the Phoenix
          Generation!<br /><br />It is an optimistic tour de force, an almost
          encyclopedic overview of the values we are shedding as we struggle
          through a very scary transition time, to what we are evolving towards.
          &nbsp;Dennis has his finger on the new generation’s pulse, the one
          that is born with intuitive access to a higher frequency of vibration,
          a multi-dimensional worldview, and an instinctive ability to love each
          other, all life, and the miraculous planet we inhabit. Bravo! Everyone
          who chooses to be optimistic while the world as we know it crumbles to
          make way for the new, should read this book! And those who are
          pessimistic, even more so.<br />- Carolyn North, author of “Worldshift
          Happens” and “In the Beginning, Creation Myths from Around the
          World.”<br /><br />"Again,&nbsp;Kingsley&nbsp;Dennis demonstrates that
          he is one of very few thinkers who seem to understand the scope and
          subtlety of the immense transition that humanity is
          experiencing.&nbsp; Weaving both theory and practice together in an
          always elegant way, he paints an extraordinary, emerging picture of
          nothing less than a new reality that operates very differently from
          the familiar.&nbsp; It would be hard to overstate the importance of
          this message to a reader who deeply desires to contribute to this
          epochal shift."<br />&nbsp;- John L. Petersen, futurist, strategist,
          and founder of the Arlington Institute&nbsp;<br /><br />“Where do I
          begin with such a powerful book?&nbsp; Perhaps with
          impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><i>The Phoenix Generation</i></b
          >&nbsp;by Kingsley Dennis gives us a more accurate, in-depth look at
          the societal impact of those born since around 1982 than any other
          source I know.&nbsp; He talks about cities and governments and
          businesses and education, and science and medicine – even the very
          roots of spirituality-turned-religion-and-back-again - &nbsp;to show
          the veritable renaissance of restoration now inborn throughout the
          human race.&nbsp; There are no borders to this upsweep, no landmass
          that can avoid or miss this upheaval.&nbsp; The new kids are here, and
          they have a different mind, a different consciousness. &nbsp;And they
          are changing the world.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />"I wrote extensively
          about the evolutionary aspects of this shift in&nbsp;<b
            ><i>Children of the Fifth World</i></b
          >, and I did an in-your-face reality check, plus and minus, on what
          they and their parents must contend with.&nbsp; These kids are more
          in-tune with the global village, collaboration not competition, making
          the impossible real.&nbsp; They are brilliant innovators who find
          school boring – most of them know more than their teachers do anyway.
          Their focus is on reinventing everything from banking to farming to
          distribution networks to designing machines that run better with less
          overhead.&nbsp; Their intuition, their inner knowing, is
          non-stop.&nbsp; They need mentors, not bosses – a little nudge or two
          – that’s it.&nbsp; As Kingsley Dennis makes clear in his book, our new
          kids function best on the quantum level – they pattern the phoenix,
          new life from the old."<br />&nbsp;-&nbsp;P. M. H. Atwater, L.H.D.,

          world dying and on the wings of a New world being born, a new
          generation is coming of age, and they, with the generations to come in
          the 21st century, are remaking our world in every way. The Phoenix
          Generation will be the crescendo of our evolving species, and the
          hallmark of a new era. Let us all join Kingsley in welcoming the
          future to our world's stage." <br />- Joshua Gorman, founder of
