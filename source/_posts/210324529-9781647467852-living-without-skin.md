          <p><strong>Feeling vulnerable is frightening. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>Being fiercely vulnerable is phenomenal. </strong></p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Most of us spend a lifetime trying to avoid pain and insecurity
            while overlooking the power we inherently possess. What would you do
            differently with your life if you knew you were failsafe at birth?
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            If you've ever felt vulnerable, weak, or like a complete failure,
            you can transform those feelings into fierce superpowers.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Life can leave you feeling raw, naked, and skinless. Learning to
            live without skin can turn you into the superhero of your dreams!
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Prepare for an extraordinary and sometimes humorous journey that
            begins with a child's imagination and ends with an ordinary adult's
            transformation on unexpected paths.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>You'll discover how embracing vulnerability can help you:</p>
          <p>- Learn how to find and wear the skin you were created for.</p>
          <p>
            - Uncover the core of your individual insecurities, and transform
            them into strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Connect internally and externally to humanity-defining power in a
            personal and public environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            - Heal from trauma so it isn't passed to the next generation as
            culture.

            with us the lessons she learned over her lifetime. Her courage,
            tenacity, and lifelong commitment to learn about herself ensured her
            survival through addiction, divorce, and her own rebellious antics.
            She learned the only way to clean up her life and find meaning and
            happiness was to do it herself, one step at a time. Through the
            power of vulnerability, she learned the only way out is through and
            the reward is becoming her authentic self, feeling comfortable in
            her skin, giving herself compassion and finding the love of her
            life. </span
