            in him and what he'll see in you.

          <p>
            The AstroTwins have been using the zodiac for over 15 years to help
            couples find the love affair of their dreams. A good relationship

            relationship with a man of any zodiac sign—the key is to learn what
            makes him tick. Using this definitive guide to understand his
            personality, his preferences, and his values will help you decide
            whether you're in it for the long haul—or not.

            "The thing that sets Ophira and Tali apart is an innate, intuitive
            nature that can't be learned or read from a chart. They absorb the
            messages of the planets and then personalize them in a way that is
            uncanny and spot-on. I never make a move without consulting them!"

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Tali and Ophira Edut (The AstroTwins) began their astrological journey
          in 1992, when a computerized printout of their charts jolted them into
          a metaphysical awakening. Wanting to know how the heck someone's time,
          date, and place of birth could reveal so much about their character,
          they delved into an inquiry, using friends, family members, historical
          figures, and pop stars as case studies. Their fascination grew into an
          obsession—and then, a career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, The AstroTwins reach over 40 million readers a month with their
          horoscopes in print, online, and broadcast. Their columns and
          predictions have appeared in Teen People, Us Weekly, OK!, Brides.com,
          Lifetime TV's website, and numerous other places. The AstroTwins have
          been featured on MTV, E!, The Style Network, and in the New York
          Times. They have read charts for celebrities including Beyonce, Stevie
          Wonder, and Sting at red-carpet events, and appear regularly on Sirius
          Radio to give live astrological advice. Tali and Ophira are Detroit
          natives who live in New York City with their posse of miniature
          dachshunds. Ophira also lives with her husband and stepdaughter.
