          A hands-on guide for designing a passionate, meaningful life that
          benefits you and the whole planet <br /><br />• Provides reflective
          visioning exercises and practical tools to help you examine your life
          as it is, the influences of your past, and the future you envision for
          yourself <br /><br />• Supports you to consciously weed out the
          thoughts and activities that get in the way of your authenticity and
          resonant heart <br /><br />• Helps you gain clarity in how to
          contribute more fully to a thriving regenerative future for both
          yourself and our world through your choices and actions
          <br /><br />When we choose to live more consciously, we benefit not
          only ourselves but all of life. In these turbulent times of transition
          and healing, women in particular are being called to reevaluate their
          lives and redirect their passion and actions toward purpose and
          meaning. By consciously redesigning our lives, we can reclaim our life
          force, connect more deeply with Nature and all life, and bring
          positive change to the world around us. Thus we become the true
          sovereign of our lives. <br /><br /><i>Life Design for Women</i>
          engages you in a simple, reflective visioning process to help you
          redesign your life to be more satisfying, meaningful, and aligned with
          your goals. Step by step, you will examine your life as it is, the
          influences of your past, and the future you envision for yourself. You
          will survey the domains of your life--from how you create “home” to
          your relationships with loved ones, food, your body, the Earth, and
          even Death. Applying the regenerative principles of sustainability to
          life design, author Ariane Burgess provides reflective exercises and
          practical tools to help you examine each of these domains, engage with
          natural systems, honor the feminine life force, and design your
          future. She shows how deep work in these areas gives you the resources
          needed to cut ties with the past and redirect your energy and passion
          toward your authentic purpose. You will learn to consciously weed out
          the thoughts and activities that get in the way of your resonant
          heart, take full responsibility for being the creator of your
          experiences, and make decisions that nurture your authentic self,
          rather than living your life through the dreams and fears of others.
          <br /><br />With this hands-on guide, you can reclaim your power
          through the Life Design process and choose to live more consciously.
          Gaining clarity on how you want to be, you bring well-being into your
          life and become a force for positive change, contributing to a
          thriving, regenerative future for life on Earth.
