            For the past forty years, doctors at the University of Virginia
            Medical Center have conducted research into young children's reports
            of past-life memories. Dr. Ian Stevenson, the founder of this work,
            has always written for a scientific audience. Now, in this
            provocative and fascinating book, Dr. Jim B. Tucker, a child
            psychiatrist who currently directs the research, shares these
            studies with the general public. <i>Life Before Life</i> is a
            landmark work—one that has the potential to challenge and ultimately
            change our understandings about life and death.<br />Children who
            report past-life memories typically begin talking spontaneously
            about a previous life when they are two to three years old. Some
            talk about the life of a deceased family member, while others
            describe the life of a stranger. They may recount details about
            previous family members, events in the previous life, or the way
            they died in that life. The children tend to show a strong emotional
            involvement with the apparent memories and often cry to be taken to
            the previous family. In many cases, parents have taken their
            children to the places they named, where they found that an
            individual had died whose life matched the details given by the
            child. During the visits, some children have recognized family
            members or friends from that individual's life. Many children have
            had birthmarks that matched wounds on the body of the deceased
            individual. <br />Researchers have studied more than 2500 such
            cases, and their careful investigations have produced an impressive
            body of work. <i>JAMA</i>, the Journal of the American Medical
            Association, stated in a review of one of Dr. Stevenson's scientific
            books that, "in regard to reincarnation he has painstakingly and
            unemotionally collected a detailed series of cases . . . in which
            the evidence is difficult to explain on any other grounds."<br /><i
              >Life Before Life</i
            >
            explores the various features of this world-wide phenomenon,
            describing numerous cases along the way. We meet a boy in Michigan
            who, after being born with three birthmarks that matched wounds on
            his deceased brother, begins talking about events from the brother's
            life; a boy in Turkey who gives a number of accurate details,
            including the name, of a man who lived 500 miles away and died fifty
            years before the boy was born; and a girl in Sri Lanka who is able
            to recognize the family members of a deceased stranger as they are
            presented to her one by one, giving specifics about their lives that
            she could not have known from their appearance. <br />Dr. Tucker
            presents this material in a straightforward way, relating
            extraordinary stories that have been amassed with a scientific
            approach. He then considers how best to interpret the evidence, and
            he lets readers reach their own conclusions—which, for many, will be
            profound.

          “In this very elegant book, Dr. Tucker offers the most convincing
          scientific evidence for the fact that our consciousness survives
          physical death. And indeed, takes quantum leaps of creativity in the
          form of reincarnation. The model that Dr. Tucker presents opens a new
          vision of who we are, limitless beings that fill up all of space and
          time.” —<i
            >Deepak Chopra, author of Life After Death: The Burden of Proof</i
          ><br /><br />“[A][ solid case for reincarnation…. Tucker introduces
          powerful grounds for credulous speculation.” —<i>Booklist</i
          ><br /><br />“Jim Tucker gives us a clear, concise and eminently
          rational insight into a 40 year investigation of what is
          unquestionably the best evidence for the existence of reincarnation.
          We are lucky to have in him a worthy successor to Ian Stevenson.” —<i
            >TOM SHRODER, author of Old Souls: Compelling Evidence From Children
            Who Remember Past Lives</i
          ><br /><br />“Anyone with an open mind, on reading Dr. Jim B.
          Tucker's<i> Life Before Life</i>, will realize that our conventional
          concepts of life and death are ripe for revision. The possibilities
          raised by this book for human destiny are as hopeful as the current
          view is grim.
          <b><i>Life Before Life </i>is extraordinarily important.</b>” —<i
            >Larry Dossey, M.D., author of The Extraordinary Healing Power of
            Ordinary Things, Reinventing Medicine, and Healing Words</i
          ><br /><br />“With his training as a pediatric psychiatrist, and the
          mind of an inquiring scientist, Dr. Jim Tucker takes a fresh look at
          one of life's most intriguing questions: 'Does consciousness survive
          death?' Through the hundreds of case studies of his predecessor, Dr.
          Ian Stevenson, and his own cases, Dr. Tucker adds new insight to this
          amazing research, and draws us closer to understanding this perennial
          mystery.” —<i
            >CAROL BOWMAN, author of Children's Past Lives and Return From
            Heaven</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Life Before Life</i> adds to the increasingly
          impressive science of consciousness and the continuity of
          mind/memory…this book is the tip of an important iceberg that will
          continue to expand our knowledge of the spiritual reality of Life.”
          —C. NORMAN SHEALY, M.D., Ph.D., President, Holos University Graduate
          Seminary; Founding President, American Holistic Medical Association;
          author of Youthful Aging—Secret of the Fountain<br /><br />“Jim B.
          Tucker's fine presentation of Ian Stevenson's decades of rigorous
          scientific research into evidence of children's apparent past-life
          recollections expresses the true spirit of scientific skepticism,
          rather than the knee-jerk materialism that all too often waves that
          proud banner.” —<i
