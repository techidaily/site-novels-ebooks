            >Doctors Cry, Too</i
          >
          is a collection of essays from the heart of physician Frank H. Boehm,
          M.D. This moving and inspirational book deals with issues surrounding
          doctors, nurses, patients, their loved ones, and the perplexing issues
          that relate to these individuals. These essays portray a medical
          profession that is sensitive, emotional, spiritual, and
          compassionate.<br /><br />They include special moments in the life of
          Dr. Frank Boehm, such as a son and daughter going off to college,
          coping with the personal grief of losing loved ones, the birth of a
          granddaughter, and the healing that comes from joy. The essays also
          address his point of view on such subjects as strength and courage,
          faith, happiness, depression, forgiveness, death and dying,
          friendship, the heartbreak of infertility, parenting, and medical
          expectations.<br /><br />
          It is the author’s hope that this book will help you understand that
          doctors are subject to the same stresses and pressures of life as
          everyone else, and that by gaining insight into the heart of one
          physician, you will gain insight into the heart of many.

          “A loving and lovely book. It will remind patients to see their
          doctors as human beings and remind doctors of their obligation to be
          human beings first.” — <b>Rabbi Harold Kushner</b>, author of
          <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People<br /><br /></i>“I believe
          that <i>Doctors Cry, Too</i> makes an important contribution toward
          guiding physicians, as well as others in the helping professions, to
          recognize their personal feelings of compassion without interfering
          with their professional responsibilities. I read this book with great
          interest and found it to be thought-provoking.” —
          <b>Dr. Ruth Westheimer</b>, author and TV personality<br /><br />“Boehm’s
          stories are filled with examples of what can happen when compassion is
          a part of the process. . . . This book should be read by every present
          and future doctor and every patient.” — <b>Bernie Siegel, M.D.</b>,
          author of <i>Love, Medicine &amp; Miracles</i> and
          <i>Prescriptions for Living<br /><br /></i>“With healing doses of
          humor, insight, and just plain common sense, Dr. Frank Boehm takes us
          into his heart more skillfully than any scalpel, revealing deep wells
          of compassion and restoring our faith and trust in the medical
          profession. With each essay, he assures us that the patient is
          paramount, the physician humane and caring, and the profession better
          prepared than ever before to meet the challenges of the century ahead.
          <i>Doctors Cry, Too</i> is must-reading, not only for patients, but
          for the next generation of physicians, as well.” —
          <b>Bill Frist, M.D.</b>, U.S. senator from Tennessee<br /><br />“For
          many years I have known Dr. Frank Boehm as a great physician.
          <i>Doctors Cry, Too</i> proves with warmth and wisdom that he can also
          heal with his words.”— <b>Crystal Gayle</b>, singer
