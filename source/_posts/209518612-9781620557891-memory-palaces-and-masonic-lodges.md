          Reveals how the art of memory is the origin of the Masonic method
          <br /><br />• Explains the classical techniques of the art of memory,
          how they were reworked by hermetic thinkers during the Renaissance,
          and how they contributed to the transformation of operative
          Freemasonry into speculative Freemasonry <br /><br />• Traces the
          creation of speculative Freemasonry to 1637, one hundred years earlier
          than previously thought <br /><br />• Explores how the “memory
          palaces” created with the art of memory enabled access to universal
          knowledge as well as represented the Masonic temple in its imaginary
          state <br /><br />In Antiquity, the art of memory was a mnemonic
          device that allowed an orator, such as Cicero, to recall all the
          points he wished to make by associating each of them with an image or
          architectural element in the site he was speaking. When this art was
          rediscovered in the Renaissance, hermetic thinkers like Giordano Bruno
          reworked it into a method that allowed them to acquire knowledge with
          the creation of “memory palaces.” The elements of these memory palaces
          were not intended to trigger the memory but would actually transform
          into talismanic objects with knowledge entirely new to the seeker.
          <br /><br />In this book, Charles B. Jameux shows that this hermetic
          reworking of the classical art of memory was no mystery to operative
          Masons, who grafted it onto their own rituals, catalyzing the
          transformation of operative Masonry into speculative Masonry. He shows
          how the hieroglyphic writing used during the Renaissance in the art of
          memory provided the groundwork for one of the most esoteric elements
          of masonic practice: the grasp of the realm of image by the letter,
          where symbols were “buried” within words. Using archival evidence from
          17th-century Scotland and earlier, combined with the research of
          modern scholars such as Frances Yates and David Stevenson, Jameux
          argues that the creation of speculative Freemasonry can be traced back
          100 years earlier than conventional history records--to 1637, when the
          first recorded use of the Mason’s Word appeared and with it, the first
          known appearance of the symbolic Temple of Solomon. He follows
          Giordano Bruno’s visit to the British Isles in the late 16th century
          and the subsequent activities of the men he met there, showing that
          Masonic symbolism owes much of its current form to early memory
          palaces, which represented the Masonic lodge and temple in their fully
          imaginary states. <br /><br />Revealing the pivotal role of the memory
          palace and hermetic traditions in early Masonic symbolism, Jameux
          sheds new light on the Masonic questions asked of each initiate and
          the spiritual importance of the Temple of Jerusalem to Freemasonry.

          “<i>Memory Palaces and Masonic Lodges</i> is a masterpiece of research
          on two topics: the art of memory and the lost Word of Freemasonry.
          Jameux’s examination of Bruno’s theories of the memory palace as a
          means to accessing celestial realms, coupled with how its application
          transforms Masonic trestle boards and temples into veritable
          talismans, is indispensable to understanding the history and practice
          of the transmission of knowledge in all its forms. This is a book I
          was planning on writing. Now I do not have to. Jameux has done the job
          for each of us--now all we need to do is apply it!”
