            ><b
              ><br />“We cannot separate the earth from its greater cosmic
              environment. What is needed is a new story and Alan Steinfeld’s
              <i>Making Contact</i> is part of that story.” —Deepak Chopra,
              Author,<i> Total Meditation<br /><br /></i>How can we prepare for
              an event that is literally beyond anything humanity has ever
              faced? </b
            ><br /><br /><i>Making Contact </i>presents multiple perspectives on
            what no longer can be denied: UFOs and their occupants are visiting
            our world. The book answers questions which remain in the wake of
            the recent Pentagon’s disclosures as to who and why these beings are
            here. <br /><br />The volume contains original writings by the
            leading experts of the phenomena such as: <b>Linda Moulton Howe</b>,
            Earthfiles reporter, <b>Whitley Strieber</b> best-selling author of
            <i>Communion</i>, <b>Professor John E. Mack</b>, former head of the
            Harvard Medical school of psychiatry and an alien abduction
            investigator, <b>Darryl Anka</b> internationally known for his
            communication with the extraterrestrial Bashar, <b>Nick Pope</b>,
            former UK Ministry of Defense UFO investigator,
            <b>Grant Cameron</b> expert on American presidents and UFOs,
            <b>Drs. J.J. and Desiree Hurtak</b>, globalists and founders of the
            worldwide organization, The Academy for Future Science,
            <b>Caroline Cory</b>, director of <i>Superhuman</i> and
            <i>ET: Contact</i>, <b>Mary Rodwell</b>, author of the
            <i>New Human</i> about star-seed children, <b>Henrietta Weekes</b>,
            actress and writer, expressing the poetic aspects of making contact.
            <b>Alan Steinfeld</b>, contributes and curates the collection with
            30 years of experience with the subject. The Foreword by
            <b>George Noory</b> of <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> kicks off the volume
            with his veteran overview of the need to wake up to the
            <i>“new realities of extraterrestrial existence.”</i><br /><br />At
            this critical juncture in the government’s official acknowledgement
            of the reality of UFOs/UAPs, scientists, politicians and mainstream
            news outlets have no idea what to make of these startling
            revelations or the outpouring of sightings and “contact” experiences
            currently being reported on a global scale. The book stands as the
            most comprehensive clarification to date on the intent and
            intelligence behind the phenomena. The variety of viewpoints
            expressed in the volume provide a solid foundation for the “<i
              >preparation” </i
            >of the greatest challenge to ever face humankind.<br /><br /><i
              >Making Contact </i
            >stands as the essential handbook for embracing the most exalted
            moment in history: Meeting the cosmic others.

          What is needed is a new story and Alan Steinfeld’s
          <i>Making Contact</i> is part of that story.” —Deepak Chopra,
          Author,<i> Total Meditation<br /><br /></i>"New Realities are upon us!
          Alan Steinfeld provides one of the most informed and open-minded
          overviews of communication with alien intelligence and the
          UFO/OVNI/UAP phenomenon in his new book, <i>Making Contact</i>."
          <br />– Alex Grey &amp; Allyson Grey, Chapel of Sacred Mirrors<br /><br />"In
          <i>Making Contact</i>, Alan Steinfeld has presented a fascinating
          compendium of views on the most important issue in the world today -
          the presence of extraterrestrial beings engaging the human race and
          the pending conformation of that presence by world governments. That
          confirmation, Disclosure, is close at hand, and this volume will help
          the reader to prepare."—Stephen Bassett, Paradigm Research Group<br /><br /><br />"This
          is a serious book. <i>Making Contact</i> needs to be read by skeptics,
          advocates, and agnostics. Skeptics may not change their minds, but
          their responses will be a useful test for their belief systems.
          Advocates will find evidence for their perspective and agnostics will
          find their worldview challenged. I have known a few of the authors of
          this anthology and will vouch for their sincerity, and we will see if
          history confirms their perspective."<br />—Stanley Krippner,
          Ph.D.co-author <i>Personal Mythology<br /><br /></i
          ><i>"Making Contact </i>is the most comprehensive book I have ever
          read about the UFO/ET phenomenon! It is a powerful introduction for
          people discovering this field of interest, and a rich resource for
          people well-acquainted with the phenomenon. A fascinating read!"<br />—Barbara
          Lamb, Contact regression therapist, speaker and author<br /><br />"In
          taking on this volume led by Steinfeld — an explorer of consciousness
          — be prepared for a melding of easy-to-swallow encounters with objects
          simply scooting through our sky to discourse on belief systems, hybrid
          Homo sapiens, and corralling your perception of awareness." —Leonard
          David, space journalist and author of <i>M</i
          ><i>oon Rush: The New Space Race<br /></i><br />"Alan Steinfeld has
          put together the perfect book for anyone who wants extensive details
          of extraterrestrial existence. It is an eye opener and mind opener. It
          will expand your consciousness to new realities and awaken you to the
          5th Dimension. <i>Making Contact</i> is a must READ."<br />—Kimberly
          Meredith, Medical Intuitive, Author
          <i>Awakening To The Fifth Dimension<br /></i><br />"[A] stimulating
          collection... . Those curious about the possibilities of
          extraterrestrial contact should take note."—<i

          ><br />“I’ve followed this field for over 3 decades and
          <i>Making Contact</i> is probably the most provocative and helpful
          anthology I have seen. From the whistleblower accounts from Howe and
          the esoterics of Weekes and the Hurtaks, to the interdimensional savvy
          of Anka and the science of Pope and Mack, the puzzle pieces are laced
          together by Alan Steinfeld masterfully and summarized in his own
          personal account.” —Foster Gamble, co-creator of Thrive 1 and 2
