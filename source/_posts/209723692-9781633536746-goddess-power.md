          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          At the dawn of religion, God was a Woman. The Divine Feminine is known
          by innumerable names and symbol-rich manifestations across the world’s
          cultures. Throughout the ages the Goddess has been honored and
          worshiped as the Virgin Mary, Isis, Inanna, Asherah, Diana, Kuan Yin,
          Kali, Oshun, Athena, Pele, Sarasvati, Demeter, and White Buffalo Calf
          Woman, to mention just a few. <i>Goddess Power</i> takes you on a
          fascinating and, at times, surprising journey into the enduring
          essence of the Divine Feminine. Inside this book you will learn:<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • How the Goddess path offers an empowering message and inspiration<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • The importance of re-establishing a healthy balance and integration
          of both the “masculine” and the “feminine” archetypes<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • That the notion of God as archetypal “Sky-Father” is fairly recent
          in Western culture<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • Why the wisdom of the Goddess/Sacred Feminine has been ignored,
          distorted, and oppressed for centuries<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • How archetypes, mythic narratives, and qualities of Goddesses are
          alive within you and how they reveal intimate truths about yourself
          and others<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • How Goddesses can serve as empowering guides in your personal and
          professional life<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • Why especially black Goddesses/dark-skinned Mothers (e.g., Kali or
          Black Madonna) are a powerful symbol and catalyst for change in our
          times, both individually and collectively<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          • And much, much more!<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “An empowering message and inspiration that can be drawn from the
          Goddess so humanity might evolve toward higher awareness.” —Karen
          Tate, author of <i>Walking an Ancient Path </i>and <i>Goddess 2.0</i>
