            I'm Done. opens the door for women everywhere who have given up on
            love. In this impossible-to-put-down work, author Lucy Shahjahan
            cuts straight to the heart of what's missing when it comes to your
            love and your life.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Loaded with gold and rooted in Shahjahan's twenty-year personal
            transformation journey, she's distilled her experience and wisdom
            into a no fluff, tangible, and energetic road map that has
            successfully transformed the lives of thousands of women around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            I'm Done. contains simple, yet powerful secrets that open and
            activate your heart, un-numbs your spirit, and allows you to soar
            like the unapologetic rockstar queen that you are.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Unlike other relationship books that collect dust on your shelf or
            attempt to "upsell" you into the real work, I'm Done. gives you all
            of the keys to the kingdom. This book is an empowering, non-clinical
            read that feels like vibrational medicine.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            I'm Done. is more than a book. Shahjahan is the paradigm-smashing
            best friend you've always wanted... and needed. This work is a gift
            that you'll clutch to your heart for years to come.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            It's time to claim your magic and meet who you really are, because
            she can attract anything she wants-including her soulmate.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>If not now, then when?</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            It's time to kick that sh*t right out of your Vortex. The good news
            is that there's actually nothing wrong with you. The bad news is
            that you're deeply misaligned with the powerhouse inside you. That's
            where the work is, and it starts with creating rockstar boundaries
            and knowing how to use your powerful Vortex!
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Lucy Shahjahan has been exactly where you are now. But when she
            committed to backing herself fully and doing the deep work required
            to open her heart, she attracted in the love of her life and started
            living her dreams. Now she wants to help you do the same thing.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In I'm Done., Lucy guides you through a powerful process that will
            unlock your heart, expression and mindset. She's the first to say
            that the process isn't pretty, but it has to be done. This book is a
            must-read if you're ready to start attracting in your soulmate,
            living your dream life and watching your reality shift on every
            level.
