          • Shares a series of mindfulness techniques and improv exercises with
          masks to suppress the ego, calm the mind, and allow spontaneous
          playfulness and spaciousness to arise from your deepest nature
          <br /><br />• Draws on Buddhist philosophy to describe how and why the
          exercises work <br /><br />• Woven throughout with a lighthearted
          parable of an overweight and out-of-work Lone Ranger and Tonto who
          meet Buddha and experience spiritual awakening<br /><br />Sharing a
          series of mindfulness techniques and acting exercises that show how
          malleable the self can be, award-winning actor, narrator, and Zen
          Buddhist priest Peter Coyote reveals how to use masks, meditation, and
          improvisation to free yourself from fixed ideas of who you think you
          are and help you release your ego from constant defensive
          strategizing, calm the mind’s overactivity, and allow spontaneous
          playfulness to arise out of your deepest nature. Developed through 40
          years of research and personal study, Coyote’s synthesis of mask-based
          improv games and Zen practices is specifically designed to create an
          ego-suppressed state akin to the mystical experiences of meditation or
          the spiritual awakenings of psychedelics. After preparatory exercises,
          seeing yourself in a mask will temporarily displace your familiar self
          and the spirit of the mask will take over. <br /><br />Likening the
          liberated state induced by mask work to “Enlightenment-lite,” Coyote
          draws on Buddhist philosophy to describe how and why the exercises
          work as well as how to make your newly awakened and confident self
          part of daily life. In true Zen form, woven throughout the narrative
          is a lighthearted parable of an out-of-work Lone Ranger and Tonto, who
          meet Buddha and experience spiritual awakening. Illuminating the
          lessons of mask work, the transformation of the Lone Ranger mirrors
          that of the individual pursuing this practice, revealing how you will
          come to realize that the world is more magical and vaster than you
          thought possible.

          “Remembering that a neutral mask class in college was one of the few
          acting exercises I found really useful, I was curious to see how an
          accomplished actor like Peter Coyote would tie mask work to the tenets
          of Buddhist philosophy. Through the lens of the Lone Ranger and Tonto,
          Coyote cleverly conveys the message of finding oneself by losing
          oneself. I highly recommend this book to every actor--veteran or
          fledgling--indeed to every human who has ever felt constrained by the
          voices of self-criticism in their head.”
