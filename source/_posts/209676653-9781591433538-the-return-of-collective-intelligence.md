          Reveals how we can each reconnect to collective intelligence and
          return our world to wholeness, balance, and sanity <br /><br />•
          Explains how collective intelligence manifests in flocks of birds,
          instantaneous knowing in indigenous peoples, and the power of sacred
          places <br /><br />• Offers ways for us to reconnect to the infinite
          source of wisdom that fuels collective intelligence and underscores
          the importance of ceremony, pilgrimage, and initiation <br /><br />•
          Draws on recent findings in New Paradigm science, traditional
          teachings from indigenous groups from North, South, and Central
          America and Siberia, as well as sacred geometry, deep ecology, and
          expanded states of consciousness <br /><br />For our ancestors,
          collective intelligence was a normal part of life. We see it today as
          the mysterious force that enables flocks of birds, swarms of bees, and
          schools of fish to function together in perfect synchrony,
          communicating and cooperating at some undetectable level. At its most
          subtle, it’s an instantaneous knowing, shared by members of a group,
          of the wisest course of action that will benefit all. <br /><br />As
          Dery Dyer reveals, collective intelligence still resides within each
          of us, and it is the key to restoring balance and harmony to our
          world. She shows how it occurs spontaneously when individuals who
          share a need and a purpose instinctively “self-organize” into a group
          and function with no leader or central authority. Such groups exhibit
          abilities much greater than what any of their members possess
          individually--or what can be replicated with artificial intelligence.
          Dyer explains, due to an unquestioning dependence on technology,
          modern humanity has forgotten how to connect with collective
          intelligence and fallen into collective stupidity, otherwise known as
          mob mind or groupthink, which is now endangering the interconnected
          web of life on Earth. <br /><br />Drawing on recent findings in New
          Paradigm science, traditional teachings from indigenous groups, as
          well as sacred geometry, deep ecology, and expanded states of
          consciousness, the author shows how the ability to think and act
          collectively for the highest good is hardwired in all living beings.
          She explains how to release ourselves from enslavement by technology
          and use it more wisely toward the betterment of all life. Underscoring
          the vital importance of ceremony, pilgrimage, and initiation, she
          offers ways for us to reconnect to the infinite source of wisdom that
          fuels collective intelligence and which manifests everywhere in the
          natural world. <br /><br />Revealing that once we relearn how to hear
          the Earth, we can heal the Earth, Dyer shows how each of us has a
          vital role to play in restoring our world to wholeness.
