            >In order to heal from traumas, we unknowingly repeat the stories of
            our lives again and again, reliving them in different scenarios in
            this life as well as in other lifetimes. This repetition of our
            behavior patterns is neither neurotic nor pathological. It is
            absolutely necessary, because painful though it may be, repetition
            offers us multiple opportunities for facing our issues, making new
            choices, and healing ourselves at last. <br /></b
          ><br />This fascinating book by Doris Eliana Cohen, Ph.D., was written
          to help us create a shift in our own consciousness as well as that of
          humanity.&nbsp;All of us have a God-given gift of free choice,
          although we may be unaware of it at times. Only when we acknowledge
          and take full responsibility for the choices we’ve made in our current
          and past lives can we begin to change our stories and end the
          suffering we’ve been causing ourselves. <br /><br />This material is
          based on Doris’s 30 years of clinical experience with patients, using
          traditional therapy techniques combined with past-life regression
          therapy. It is guided and inspired by her communication with Guides
          and Angels of the Light, who have accompanied her for many years.
          <br /><br />Within these pages, Doris presents the 7 Steps of Rebirth,
          which provide a profound yet swift and simple route to change our
          lives and heal ourselves. Her 4 Steps of Joy offer a powerful tool for
          accessing the Light swiftly and easily. Remembering the events of our
          past lives provides a rich and fascinating tapestry of our journey,
          resulting in the humbling and uplifting realization that our souls are
          on a grand adventure. In owning our stories, we move from seeing
          ourselves as victims of life to empowering ourselves as co-creators of
          our destiny.
