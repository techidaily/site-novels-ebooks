          New dance leaders, and experienced leaders as well, can profit from
          the extensive and well-organized compilation of suggestions, ideas,
          traditions, and techniques that Dede Callichy has collected by
          observing dances in progress, interviewing long-time dance leaders,
          and from her own learning experience.

          It can be read all the way through for an overview, or used as a
          reference to explore particular topics.&nbsp; Even after 25 years of
          dancing and numerous leader training retreats, I still found ideas
          that were new to me, in addition to validation of much hard-earned
          knowledge.&nbsp; It would have been helpful to have read such a book
          at the beginning of my leadership journey.

          With great patience and determination, Dede has succeeded in
          fulfilling the call to put together the Leader of the Dance, the first
          Australian contribution to the literature of the International Network
          for the Dances of Universal Peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          This well-researched book is a comprehensive guide to Dances of
          Universal Peace leadership. It serves not only as useful training
          wheels for those starting out on their dance leadership training, but
          also as inspirational material for seasoned leaders.
        </p>

          The layout makes it easy to cross-access clarification in different
          areas of leadership and the indexed reference section stimulates
          further research.<br />The illustrations and photos enhance the
          written word and Dede's humour dances lightly through the pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dede verifies that trainee leaders evolve their skill under the caring
          guidance of their mentors, because experience is the best teacher.
          This book is a valuable and illuminating adjunct for supporting and
          enhancing leadership proficiency. I recommend it highly!
