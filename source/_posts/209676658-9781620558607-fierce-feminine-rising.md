          A guide for embodying the courage of the Fierce Feminine, or Dark
          Mother, to heal yourself and the world at large <br /><br />•
          Describes how to embody the sacred rage of the Fierce Feminine and
          channel the universal outrage collectively rising in many of us to
          seek justice for those who can’t defend themselves <br /><br />•
          Details constructive energetic and spiritual practices to help heal
          from predatory relationships and traumatic experiences, recenter your
          personal power, and gain control of your sacred rage rather than
          allowing it to control you <br /><br />• Explains how to gain access
          to primordial female wisdom within the brain, embrace your inner Kali,
          and personally deal with sorrow and anger <br /><br />• Includes
          access to online audio tracks <br /><br />After millennia of
          suppression, the Fierce Feminine, or Dark Mother, is making a dramatic
          resurgence to express our universal outrage. She is rising
          collectively now, and many women--and men--are feeling a welling up of
          sacred rage inside, a calling to set things right in our own lives and
          seek justice for those who can’t defend themselves.
          <br /><br />Offering much-needed perspective, advice, and tools for
          channeling the righteous energy and sacred rage of the Divine
          Feminine, Anaiya Sophia explains how to distinguish the Fierce
          Feminine from personal anger and reveals how it is not a feminist
          movement set to publicly condemn all that is masculine but a
          collective spiritual uprising for the greater good of humanity. She
          shares constructive practices drawn from Eastern tradition to help you
          embody the courage of the Fierce Feminine to heal from predatory
          relationships and traumatic experiences, recenter your personal power,
          and gain control of your sacred rage rather than allowing it to
          control you. She details sacred sexuality exercises, including those
          with a yoni egg to clear the womb after lovemaking and dispel any
          energetic imprint left by an ex-partner. She provides instructions to
          gain access to the primordial wisdom within the untapped portion of
          the female brain, embrace your inner Kali, and personally deal with
          sorrow and anger. <br /><br />Through this passionate step-by-step
          guide to comfort your spiritual anguish and dispel the helplessness of
          not knowing what to do, Anaiya Sophia encourages those who feel the
          call of the Fierce Feminine to embrace their sacred mission and allow
          it to rebalance the powers that govern the planet as well as harmonize
          our minds. When we allow the justice of the Fierce Feminine to flow
          within us, we each become an active participant in the embodiment of
          change.

          "Anaiya is a delightfully joyful energetic gifted and mindful
          representative of a healing Spirit and voyager through the world mind
          body and time who is helping make others aware of their ability to
          face any decision or challenge bringing balance and trust into their
          lives beyond fear and any limitation and is one of the most authentic
          and pleasant guests I have had the honor to chat with. Like many of my
          guests she embodies the soul of a messenger of truth so needed in
          these difficult modern times. This somewhat much under investigated
          subject Fierce Feminine Being moves us more easily to begin to
          remember our divine soul gift of light and love as we move to the best
          of our natural ability to continue with the empowerment of all souls
          male and female and our energetic equality in the flow of life."
