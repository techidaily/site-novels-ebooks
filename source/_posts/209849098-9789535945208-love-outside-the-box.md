            Join author and relationships expert Deane Thomas as he encourages
            readers to begin their journey toward satisfying and permanent love
            of self -- so essential for day-to-day living and happiness..<br /><br />You’ll
            learn how self-love is every person’s right, and how we are born
            with it. Find out why it is that, for most of us, self-love seems to
            get lost along the way as we focus more on others’ needs at the
            expense of our own.<br /><br />“Love is an essence that lives within
            each of us -- very pure and very real,” the author says. Learn how
            to find your own “Twin Soul,” and begin experiencing that deep-down
            feeling of completion that only comes when a relationship is truly
            grounded in love.<br /><br />This book offers solid advice and
            concrete commentary on how your feelings of self-love might have
            become buried over time and what to do to reclaim it.<br /><br />Remember.
            Love begins and ends with each of us. It is an amazing energy that
            should be shared without condition or expectation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Learn
            to look in a mirror and love what you see each day. Love Outside the
            Box will help you do that.

          In his ground breaking new book&nbsp;Love Outside the Box, author and
          relationships expert Deane Thomas encourages readers to begin their
          journey toward satisfying and permanent love by first looking within
          themselves.<br />&nbsp;<br />The book is a treasure trove of excellent
          advice and commentary on the subject of love -- both of self and
          others. And Thomas, through insightful commentary and personal
          anecdotes, will soon stimulate your own "out of the box" thinking on
          this critical subject.<br />&nbsp;<br />"We learn from the moment of
          conception," Thomas says. "But the constant within us remains a pure
          love energy. We are created in love, and our basis for existence is
          love. Indeed,the very essence of our creation is love."<br />&nbsp;<br />In
          addition, he asserts that love is a powerful energy that takes us over
          if we truly allow it to.<br />&nbsp;<br />For generations, and, in
          fact, as far back as humans have roamed the planet, we have been
          trying to decipher and make sense of the emotion of love -- with its
          myriad of manifestations and applications. In the final analysis,
          however, love is intensely personal and is the vivid force that speaks
          most directly to us --and to our souls.<br />&nbsp;<br />A little
          further on in the book, Thomas asserts that barriers to love are
          everywhere and we must be constantly vigilant, lest we go astray in
          our search. "The current moment bears no relationship to the past," he
          says. "But the ego-mind will use the past to torment the present and
          the future. This activity hinders us from truly experiencing what we
          should be encountering or feeling."<br />&nbsp;<br />He goes on to
          point out that, in times of crisis, we tend to go into defensive or
          offensive mode, and"our ego-mind comes out in its full glory." This
          is, however, perfectly normal and to be expected. But it is how we
          follow through with our actions that determine a constructive
          outcome.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One thing is for sure, he adds. We can
          never regret anything we have experienced in this life. "There is no
          right or wrong," Thomas says. "There are simply lessons we learn."<br />&nbsp;<br />Childhood
          should be a happy time, with liberal doses of love being heaped upon
          each and every child. But the author, relating that regular abuse --
          verbal and physical -- was laid upon him in his youth, says that,
          sadly, unconditional love is increasingly not the norm around the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The amount of time children spend in healthy loving environments is
          slowly eroding," Thomas says, "which in the long term is not (going to
          be) beneficial for the evolution of the human race." What happened to
          us as a child was not our responsibility, he goes on to clarify, and
          never will be.&nbsp;"But, somehow, we have to make peace with this
          unhappy fact."<br />&nbsp;<br />The baggage we carry is so often not
          ours.&nbsp;"We carry other people's issues and opinions so that we may
          keep them happy, or protect them in some way," he states. "Placing
          yourself first is the key to happiness going forward." And, he adds,
          "You can decide who will be part of your life journey in the
          future."<br />&nbsp;<br />In the section on Spirituality and the Soul
          Journey, Thomas really drives home his theme of early childhood being
          key to future happiness in terms of self-love and feelings of self
          worth.<br />&nbsp;<br />"Throughout the first years of life, we are
          NOT taught what love is; we are shown instead, through association and
          example from others, that love is associated only with an external
          existence and is shared between those with whom we are close (our
          family and friends). In effect, then, society is conditioning each and
          everyone, from the minute we are born, on what love is and how to
          express it."
