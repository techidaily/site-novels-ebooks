          <b>Finding Forgiveness and Freedom on the Camino de Santiago<br /></b
          ><br />Life was falling apart. Within the space of three years,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and six-sensory spiritual
          teacher <b>Sonia Choquette</b> had suffered the unexpected death of
          two close family members, seen her marriage implode, and been let down
          by trusted colleagues. And sympathy was not forthcoming. "You’re a
          world-renowned intuitive guide and teacher," people jeered. "How could
          you not have seen this coming?" Having intuitive abilities didn’t make
          her superhuman, however. Nor did it exempt her from being wounded or
          suffering the pain of loss and the consequences of our all-too-human
          traits such as anger, resentment, and pride—traits that can lead even
          the best of us to stray from our path.<br /><br />In order to regain
          her spiritual footing, Sonia turned to the age-old practice of
          pilgrimage and set out to walk the legendary Camino de Santiago, an
          800-kilometer (500-mile) trek over the Pyrenees and across northern
          Spain. Day after day she pushed through hunger, exhaustion, and pain
          to reach her destination. Eventually, mortification of the flesh gave
          way to spiritual renewal, and she rediscovered the gifts of humility
          and forgiveness that she needed to repair her world.<br /><br />In
          this riveting book, Sonia shares the intimate details of her grueling
          experience, as well as the unexpected moments of grace, humor, beauty,
          and companionship that supported her through her darkest hours. While
          her journey is unique, the lessons she learned—about honoring your
          relationships with others as well as with your own higher self, and
          forgiving all else—are universal.
