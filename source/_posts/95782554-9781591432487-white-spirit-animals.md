          Explores the powers and wisdom of sacred White Spirit Animals
          <br /><br />• Looks in-depth at the lessons of the major White Spirit
          Animals: the White Bear, White Lion, White Elephant, White Wolf, and
          White Buffalo <br /><br />• Explains how to use shamanic dreaming and
          trans-species telepathy to communicate with these great spiritual
          teachers <br /><br />• Reveals how White Spirit Animals are calling
          humanity to restore balance, respect, reverence, and honor to protect
          our animal kin, ourselves, and the earth <br /><br />Beautiful
          rarities of nature, all-white animals are held sacred by many
          indigenous cultures and offer deep wisdom to all who will listen. In
          addition to the White Buffalo, there are other revered white animals,
          such as the White Wolf, White Lion, White Elephant, and White Bear.
          Each of these White Spirit Animals belongs to a species at the apex of
          their ecosystem, meaning the environment in which they live will
          unravel without them. Speaking through ancient and modern prophecy and
          the many humans who communicate with them, these White Spirit Animals
          are urgently calling to humanity to restore balance and protect our
          animal kin, ourselves, and the earth. <br /><br />Combining sacred
          elder lore, science, and her own telepathic dreams, Zohara Hieronimus
          looks at the special role played by White Spirit Animals in spiritual
          traditions and prophecy around the globe, where they are seen as
          guardians of animal wisdom, each with a special purpose and gift. She
          reveals how they have collaborated with humanity since the last ice
          age, inspiring spiritual practices and conferring shamanistic powers,
          and are considered the stewards of the great spiritual transformations
          that occur during transitional times. Sharing the waking vision of
          White Spirit Animals that called her to write this book, and their
          message of CPR for the earth--conservation, preservation, and
          restoration--she explains how to use shamanic dreaming and
          trans-species telepathy to communicate with these great spiritual
          teachers. Exploring each one of the major White Spirit Animals--White
          Buffalo, White Lion, White Elephant, White Wolf, and White Spirit
          Bear--and the cultures in which they are honored, the author shows,
          for example, how the White Buffalo is called a harbinger of peace and
          abundance by many Native American tribes and the White Bear, the great
          earth healer, teaches us about nurturance and patience. <br /><br />As
          a bridge between the spiritual and physical worlds, between humans and
          animals, White Spirit Animals are calling us to open our hearts to the
          wild, to the sacredness of the wind, the water, the earth, and dream a
          new world into being to heal our own personal and collective wounds
          and restore the earth to balance.
