            >A fascinating combination of leading-edge science and present-day
            realities revealing the strategies for embracing stressful change in
            our lives.<br /></b
          ><br />In this compelling revised edition of his book
          <i>The Turning Point</i>, best-selling author and visionary
          <b>Gregg Braden</b> merges his expertise in leading-edge science with
          present-day realities to reveal the strategies for embracing stressful
          change in our lives. This updated edition contains an all-new chapter
          not included in the original release, featuring material on the
          surprising discovery of brain-like cells – <i>sensory neurites</i> –
          located within the human heart, and the role they play in creating
          personal resilience. The powerful heart-brain connection made possible
          by these cells is now recognized as a portal to the deepest levels of
          our intuition, as well as a gateway to the subconscious mind.<br /><br />This
          book gets to the heart of the fundamental question you have no doubt
          asked yourself in the face of the complexities and challenges of the
          modern world:
          <i>How do I make everyday life better for myself and my family?</i>
          Through his skillful synthesis of easy-to-understand science and
          real-life circumstances, Gregg uniquely provides the answer,
          describing:<br /><br />· State-of-the-art discoveries that are the key
          to embracing big change in a healthy way<br />· The three shifts that
          will transform the way you think of your career, lifestyle, and
          finances<br />· The simple strategies of heart-based resilience that
          you can learn and use immediately for optimal health in our stressful
          world<br />· A template of strategies for resilient living for your
          family and community . . . and much more.<br /><br /><br />Gregg is an
          optimist, as well as a realist. His lifetime of work with indigenous
          cultures, combined with his scholarship in science and ancient
          traditions, gives him reason to believe in our ability to transform in
          a healthy way. To get to that point, however, we must be honest with
          ourselves. When the facts are clear, our choices become obvious and
          something beautiful happens. And it’s the power of this simple truth
          that is the basis for <b><i>Resilience from the Heart</i></b
          >. Join Gregg on this intimate journey as he unlocks the mystery of
          the world’s extremes . . . to reveal the power to thrive in life!

        <p>
          New York Times best-selling author and geologist Gregg Braden is
          internationally renowned as a pioneer in bridging science and
          indigenous knowledge to create real-world solutions for today.
          Following successful careers in the energy and defense industries, he
          became the first technical operations manager for Cisco Systems in
          1991. For three decades, Gregg has explored high mountain villages,
          remote monasteries, and forgotten texts to merge their wisdom with the
          best science of our time. Based in New Mexico, Gregg has shared his
          discoveries with Fortune 500 companies, the United Nations, mainstream
          universities, and audiences throughout the world. Website:
