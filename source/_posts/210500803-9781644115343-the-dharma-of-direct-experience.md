            >A deep exploration of the direct experience of non-dual reality and
            its lessons for spiritual growth and development</b
          ><br /><br />• Examines the direct perception of non-dual reality and
          shows its implications for navigating ordinary reality in an open,
          compassionate, and ever-maturing way<br /><br />• Shares the author’s
          most significant awakening experiences and explores their
          psycho-emotional and psychospiritual foundations<br /><br />• Offers
          practical teachings for spiritual understanding, emotional
          development, and the cultivation of compassion<br /><br />Exploring
          the direct perception of non-dual, “non-ordinary” reality, Paul Weiss
          shares guidance for navigating ordinary reality in an open,
          compassionate, and ever-maturing way. He affirms our shared human
          potential for the “direct experience” of reality--unmediated by our
          more relativistic mental faculties--and reveals this experience as an
          essential dimension of our conscious capacity for growth. He shares
          his most significant awakening experiences and the circumstances
          leading up to them, exploring the personal and transpersonal
          dimensions of the experiences and their psycho-emotional and psycho-
          spiritual foundations. He points to such experiences as part of our
          ongoing integration as human beings and the essential path of practice
          that supports our availability to them. <br /><br />Interweaving
          perspectives from psychology and neuroscience with important lessons
          from spiritual traditions around the world, Weiss explores how to live
          a life of integrity, reciprocity, and openness to reality, offering
          practical teachings for spiritual understanding, emotional
          development, and the cultivation of compassion, viewed by ancient
          Buddhist sages as the true meaning of existence. He addresses such
          human qualities as vulnerability, empathy, reciprocity, openness, and
          intimacy and shows how they express and participate in deeper
          conscious truths. The author also examines practical wisdom teachings
          within both Buddhist and Christian paths to realization.<br /><br />Combining
          engaged mysticism with transcendent humanism, along with thought-
          provoking poetry, Weiss offers a living vision of a non-dual way of
          experiencing the world, a path that supports our functional,
          emotional, and spiritual maturity.
