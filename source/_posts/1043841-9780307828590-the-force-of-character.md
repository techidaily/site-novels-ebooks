          In his bestselling <i>The Soul's Code</i>, James
          Hillman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restored passion and meaning to the
          concept of identity, arguing that each of us is born with an innate
          character, the "daimon" or "spirit" that calls us&nbsp;&nbsp;to what
          we are meant to be. Now, in <b>The Force of Character</b>, Hillman
          brings the idea of character full circle, offering a revolutionary new
          vision of life's most feared and misunderstood chapter: old age.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
          "Aging is no accident," Hillman writes. "It is necessary to the human
          condition, intended by the soul." We become more characteristic of who
          we are simply by lasting into later years; the older we become, the
          more our true natures emerge. Thus the final years have a very
          important purpose: the fulfillment and confirmation of one's
          character.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Contrary to
          the current genetic determinism that sees increased longevity as a
          wasted aberrance created by civilization,
          <b>The Force of Character</b> presents an explosive new thesis: The
          changes of old age, even the debilitating ones, have purposes and
          values organized by the psyche. Memory for recent events may falter,
          offering more place for long-term recollections. A heart condition in
          later life brings an opportunity to remove blockages from constricted
          relationships, while changes in sleep patterns allow the old to
          experience the profound elements of nighttime that we usually
          overlook. As Hillman says, "Aging makes metaphors of biology."<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
          <br />In this empowering and original work, James Hillman resurrects
          the ancient, widespread, and socially effective idea of the old person
          as "ancestor," a model for the young, the bearer of a society's
          cultural memory and traditions. America disregards old people who
          aren't young-acting and young-looking. We don't realize that "oldness"
          is an archetypal state of being that can add value and luster to
          things we treasure, places we revere, and people's character. When we
          open our imaginations to the idea of the ancestor, aging can free us
          from convention and transform us into a force of nature, releasing our
          deepest beliefs for the benefit of society.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all who
          read it, <b>The Force of Character</b> will be a
          seminal,&nbsp;&nbsp;life-affirming experience.
