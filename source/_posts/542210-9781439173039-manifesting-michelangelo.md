            >“And then it happened . . . a ray of illumination shot straight up
            and down to the left and the right, forming a pair of axes. My heart
            began to beat very fast, yet I didn’t blink. I couldn’t have taken

          <br /><br />At the dawn of the new millennium, Joseph Pierce Farrell
          made a startling discovery that holds the potential to transform the
          world. Having abandoned his childhood dream of a career in healthcare,
          he had settled for a passionless job in real estate, lining his
          pockets while eroding his soul. Then one day he fell into a humble job
          restoring antiques and furniture. One evening while working in his
          basement studio, he drifted into a meditative state and permitted his
          mind to soar with the unlimited imagination of a child. In that
          moment, he experienced a brilliant, blinding flash that ignited within
          him a remarkable power. <br /><br />Since that transformative moment,
          he has restored the facial features of a severely disfigured young
          man, virtually erased an inoperable brain tumor, dramatically reversed
          the aging process of the faces of celebrities, and mended broken
          bones—simply with intention supported by a profound connection to a
          higher source. After a decade of his pioneering work exploring
          consciousness and its relationship to health and healing, Farrell was
          invited to present his findings internationally in academic settings,
          catapulting him to the cutting edge of the integrative healthcare
          movement. Endorsed by leading researchers and medical doctors,
          Farrell’s body of evidence has begun to construct a bridge to permit
          science and spirituality to heal their divide and advance the emerging
          integrative healthcare model. In this unprecedented book, Farrell
          chronicles his journey of discovery and poignant stories of human
          transformation. He outlines an easy-to-follow five-step process that
          readers can use to ignite their own capacity to manifest change in
          their lives and the world. Heralding a message of unlimited
          possibility, <i>Manifesting Michelangelo </i>makes a compelling
          argument, supporting what science is beginning to embrace, what the
          great artists have always known, and what spiritual traditions have
          long promised—that we possess a latent capacity to manifest on the
          level of the miraculous. It is the first book that asks us to
          believe—based not on faith alone, but on eyewitness medical testimony,
          scientific evidence, and profound photos—that we have the capacity to
          manifest the change in the world that our conscience decrees and our
          hearts desire.
