          <b>Think you have no time for mindfulness? Think again.</b
          ><br /><br />
          "Thoughtful and provocative.... The relevance of this work is
          unquestionable, as it leaves us inspired and optimistic that true
          healing really is possible" (Sharon Salzberg). For four decades, Jon
          Kabat-Zinn has been teaching the tangible benefits of meditation in
          the mainstream. Today millions of people have taken up a formal
          mindfulness meditation practice as part of their everyday lives. But
          how do you actually go about meditating? What does a formal meditation
          practice look like? And how can we overcome some of the common
          obstacles to incorporating meditation into daily life in an age of
          perpetual self-distraction? <br /><br /><i>Falling Awake</i> directly
          answers these urgent and timely questions. Originally published in
          2005 as part of a larger book titled <i>Coming to Our Senses</i>, it
          has been updated with a new foreword by the author and is even more
          relevant today. Science shows that the tangible benefits of a
          mindfulness meditation practice are impossible to ignore. Kabat-Zinn
          explains how to incorporate them into our hectic, modern lives. Read
          on for a master class from one of the pioneers of the worldwide
          mindfulness movement.
