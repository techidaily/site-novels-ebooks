              >Use the hidden foundations of mindfulness to rediscover calm and
              reclaim your life in our chaotic world.</b
            ><br /><br />
            There are moments in life that decide your fate. They ripple into
            the future and dictate how you experience the world in the moments
            that follow; either positive and uplifting, dark and chaotic, or
            flat and dull.<br /><br />
            What if you could recognize these moments before they seized control
            of your life? What if you could use them to set sail for a better
            future? What if&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;moments, big and small, could
            be harnessed this way?<br /><br />
            In&nbsp;<i>Deeper Mindfulness</i>, Oxford Professor Mark Williams
            and Dr Danny Penman reunite to present a new eight-week guided
            meditation program&nbsp;that takes mindfulness to the next
            level.&nbsp;<i>Deeper Mindfulness</i>&nbsp;reveals how the latest
            advances in neuroscience, combined with millennia old wisdom, can be
            used to transform your life. These discoveries open the doors to a
            deeper layer of mindfulness known as the 'feeling tone'. This sets
            the 'background color' that tinges your entire experience of life.
            It is also the tipping point from which you can reclaim your life in
            an increasingly stressful and chaotic world.<br /><br />
            Proven effective at treating anxiety, stress and depression, the
            practices in&nbsp;<i>Deeper Mindfulness</i>&nbsp;offer a new and
            more fruitful direction for both novice and experienced meditators.
            It also allows the rest of us to approach life with renewed
            strength, vigor and equanimity.

          “Williams and Penman nail it when they describe how we can run from
          life (and ourselves) but we’ll never escape.
          <i>Deeper Mindfulness</i> holds true to its name: the authors expertly
          point out how to identify those critical driving forces in our lives
          –feelings, and how feelings feel—but importantly have provided a
          pragmatic path and clear steps that we can take to leverage our minds
          to live better lives. Based in deep wisdom and written with
          compassion.”<br />
