          <p>
            To those of you who ask the author if there is a real Anaya, her
            response is "No except inside of me and my heart."
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            This is an exciting story with over thirty hand-drawn color
            illustrations about Anaya's search to find her own truths about the
            origin of mankind, why are we living here on earth, and where is our
            journey ultimately taking us.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In this book, Anaya merges our current knowledge of science and
            religion to enlighten us with the concept that all humans have an
            inheritance from our prime Creator God of eternal life. And also
            that we are all each connected as one in the human collective as
            well as with God as being a part of His divine, universal family.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Begin your journey with Anaya as she starts her journey with the
            beginning of God's creation of the Elohim/angels on day 1 and the
            subsequent creation of man on day 6. This book contains a detailed
            depiction of the war in heaven that resulted from two hundred fallen
            angels who devised an evil plan against God to infiltrate, take
            over, and control the affairs of mankind on earth.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            God's original plan for earth was for mankind to have a life full of
            peace, love, and happiness and to learn the lessons of life. These
            two hundred fallen angels still have control over earth today
            through the reptilians who rule through the thirteen elite families
            and by the usage of artificial intelligence. The actions of the two
            hundred fallen angels began with the fall of Atlantis over
            twenty-five thousand years ago to our present times.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Continue your journey with Anaya as she uncovers ancient hidden
            knowledge from one of the oldest books known to man, the Ethiopian
            Bible, as it reveals some of the chosen men God has sent to earth to
            assist mankind and prepare the way for Jesus to come and redeem from
            their sins and from the dark shadows of the fallen angels.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Journey with Anaya to the end of her ascension journey as she shares
            in detail her personal ascension experiences and how our prime
            Creator God sent higher intelligent guides and angels to help in her
            ascension process and to assist in the evolution and restoration of
            the planet earth.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            What a blessed time for all humanity to be living during the golden
            age of earth as it evolves along with all awakened humans to the new
            heaven on 5D earth!
