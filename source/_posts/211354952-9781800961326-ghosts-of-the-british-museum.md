              ><br />What if the British Museum isn't a carefully ordered cross
              section of history but is in instead a palatial trophy cabinet of
              colonial loot - swarming with volatile and errant spirits?</i
            ><br /><br />When artist and writer Noah Angell first heard murmurs
            of ghostly sightings at the British Museum he had to find out more.
            What started as a trickle soon became a deluge as staff old and new
            - from overnight security to respected curators - brought him
            testimonies of their supernatural encounters.<br /><br />It became
            clear that the source of the disturbances was related to the
            Museum's contents - unquiet objects, holy plunder, and restless
            human remains protesting their enforced stay within the colonial
            collection's cabinets and deep underground vaults. According to
            those who have worked there, the institution is heaving with
            profound spectral disorder.<br /><br /><i

            imperial past and unmasks the world's oldest national museum as a
            site of ongoing conflict, where restless objects are held against
            their will.<br /><br />It now appears that the objects are fighting
            back.

        <p>
          <b>Noah Angell</b> is a writer and artist who works with orally
          transmitted forms such as storytelling and song. This work has led him
          to collaborate with the Polar Museum in the north of Norway, while
          working in North Carolina on a documentary film on gospel singer
          Connie B. Steadman, and in London, where he has collected testimony of
          the ghosts that haunt the British Museum.<br /><br />Born in the US,
          he was resident in London for over a decade and now lives in Berlin.
          This is his first book.
