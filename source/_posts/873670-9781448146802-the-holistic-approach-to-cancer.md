            When people are told they have cancer, they are apt to feel shocked,
            angry and frightened. They usually still have the idea that they
            have 'caught' a fatal disease, and, unless it has been found early
            on, that they will inevitably slip towards death within a measurable
            period of a few years or even a few months. Furthermore, most
            patients still think that only the doctors can help them, and tend
            to assume that even this help is regrettably limited. For most
            patients have not yet heard of a very different idea about the
            nature of cancer and its cure, which is now gaining ground.<br /><br />You
            have been told that you have cancer. There is a great deal you can
            do to help yourself. You have a good chance of reversing your
            cancer. Take courage!<br /><br />No one can promise a cure. What can
            be said is that a growing number of people have pulled themselves
            round by the methods described in this book, taking responsibility
            for their health upon themselves. This is not an alternative to
            orthodox therapy; it is complementary to it, and greatly enhances
            its effects. It is extending orthodox therapy into areas which it
            does not usually reach at present.<br /><br />You can improve the
            quality of your life, and give the restorative healing forces a
            better chance to accomplish their task.<br /><br />So get started on
            it right away.

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Dr Pearce was educated at Lancing College, Trinity College, Oxford and
          the London Hospital. He qualified in 1939 and was a house physician at
          the London Hospital until he joined the RAFVR (Medical Branch) in
          1940. Dr Pearce was mentioned in Despatches for services in malaria
          control in India, Burma and Malaya. He practised as a family doctor
          with the NHS from 1946 to 1979, during which time he developed,
          through experience, a conviction that it was essential to take a more
          holistic approach to all disease.<br />Since his retirement he became
          involved in the complementary treatment of cancer and was soon one of
          the leading specialists in this field. Dr Pearce has broadcast both on
          radio and TV, he has lectured in the UK and Ireland and in many parts
          of the world including South Africa, the USA and Canada. Dr Pearce
          died in 1987.
