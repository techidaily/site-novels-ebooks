            >Discover the secret relationship between erotic, the sexual, and
            the sacred</b
          >
          <br /><br />Sex is not negative or positive. Sex is not just neutral,
          nor is it merely sacred because it creates babies. None of these old
          sexual stories work for us anymore. We need a new sexual narrative.
          This book gives the new sexual narrative, what the authors call Sex
          Erotic. <br /><br />Erotic Mystics from the hidden tradition of
          Solomon's temple taught a secret doctrine: sex is the source of all
          wisdom. It's an expression of the erotic impulse of existence itself
          alive in us–the yearning for contact, pleasure, and aliveness. The
          sexual, however, is not the sum total of the erotic. Rather, the
          sexual teaches us how to live an erotic life in all dimensions of our
          existence. That is Sex Erotic. <br /><br /><i
            >A Return to Eros: The Radical Experience of Being Fully Alive</i
          >, from Drs. Marc Gafni and Kristina Kincaid, reveals the radical
          tenets of the relationships between the sexual, the erotic, and the
          holy. They share what Eros actually means and also the 12 core
          qualities of the erotic, which are modeled by the sexual. These
          include being on the inside, fullness of presence, yearning,
          allurement, fantasy, surrender, creativity, pleasure, and more.
          <br /><br /><i>A Return to Eros</i> shows why these qualities of the
          erotic modeled by the sexual are actually the same core qualities of
          the sacred. The relationship between the sexual and the erotic becomes
          clear, teaching you how to live an erotically suffused existence
          charged with purpose, potency, and power. To be an empowered lover—not
          just in sex but also in all facets of your life—you must listen to the
          whisperings of the sexual. Transform your understanding and experience
          of love, sex, and Eros inside these pages.

          human. Read it and be forever enlivened and transformed! I believe
          this is the most compelling invitation ever written to live the Erotic

          >&nbsp; <br /><br />"Surrender to this book. Erudite, provocative, and
          filled with lively insights, there is much to be learned from it about
          the sexual confusion of our times." <br /><br /><b

          >&nbsp; <br /><br />"<i>A Return to Eros</i> is a book written with no

          >&nbsp; <br /><br />"I've known Kristina for many decades . . . great
          to see she is sharing her life work with the world . . . Join the
          outrageous love train!" <br /><br /><b

            <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
            <i>They Call Me Supermensch</i></b
          >&nbsp; <br /><br />"<i>A Return to Eros</i> is a powerful and
          thought-provoking book—which has the potential to transform your
          life." <br /><br /><b
            >—Sally Kempton, author of <i>Awakening Shakti</i></b
          >&nbsp; <br /><br />"<i>A</i> <i>Return to Eros&nbsp;</i>should be
          placed on the shelf next to the great works on emotional and sexual
          emancipation, including Marcuse's&nbsp;<i>Eros and Civilization</i
          >&nbsp;and O Brown's&nbsp;<i>Life Against Death</i>.&nbsp;Gafni and
          Kincaid remind us that&nbsp;eros&nbsp;and ethics are inseparable, that
          we must free the erotic from the ghetto of the merely sexual, and in
          so doing awaken our passion for truth and justice.&nbsp;There may be
          no more urgent lesson for our culture, which now stands on the brink
          of another descent into barbarism, that it is through and from love
          that true power flows." <br /><br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Dr. Marc Gafni</b> is a thought leader, social innovator,
          passionate philosopher, wisdom teacher, and author of ten books,
          including the award-winning Your Unique Self. He holds a doctorate in
          philosophy from Oxford University, and is the co-founder with Ken
          Wilber of The Center for Integral Wisdom, an activist think tank
          dedicated to evolving and articulating a shared global vision of
          ethics, eros and meaning. Together with entrepreneur Kate Maloney,
          Marc is the initiating visionary of the Success 3.0 Summit and RiseUp,
          which bring together key thought leaders and change-agents to
          collaboratively weave a bold new Integral vision of Success. A leading
          public intellectual and activist, Gafni is evolving a post-dogmatic
          shared language of meaning rooted in the entrepreneurial values of

          theorist and teacher of Unique Self Enlightenment and Evolutionary
          Love. He has been called a master of the heart and a trail-blazing
          visionary in opening up new possibilities for Conscious Evolution,
          Unique Self realization and a politics of Outrageous Love. Known for
          his rare combination of brilliant mind and overflowing heart, he
          teaches on the cutting edge of philosophy in the West--articulating a
          new 'dharma,' or meta-theory of meaning that is helping pave the way
          for the evolution of consciousness.<br /><br />
          <b>Dr. Kristina Kincaid</b> is the Director of Integral of
          Evolutionary Tantra Institute in New York City. IET teaches, coaches

          that in order to respond to the challenges that face our planet today,
          it is imperative to create a WE space, where we as individuals and
          individual systems realize that enlightened consciousness is beyond
          ego, and is the essential next stage of self transformation.<br />Kristina
          is on faculty at The Institute of Core Energetics and holds an M.A. in
          Energy Medicine and a Doctorate in Theology from Holos University. A

          affiliate of the Center for Integral Wisdom. The Outrageous Love
          Projects are community writing and art initiatives birthed from Dr.
          Gafni's creation of a community practice of writing love letters. The
          movement's intention is to literally democratize enlightenment,
          empowering everyone to radically participate in the very evolution of
          love itself. Lastly, Kristina has traveled extensively, studying
          indigenous healers around the world and documenting her findings in a

          mysteries of the body, genetics, and evolution. Her journey has taken
          her into deep explorations of the feminine and healing around
          sexuality. She has a Healing practice in New York City.
