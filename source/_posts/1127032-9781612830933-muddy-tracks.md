            "One of the precious gifts of my father's legacy was his insistence
            that people can turn beliefs into knowns, finding out for themselves
            through direct experience that they are indeed more than their
            physical bodies. In that spirit, this book is a fine example of
            another explorer's journey into profound self-discovery, and
            particularly to the realization that "love is the only thing in life
            that counts." --Laurie A. Monroe, President, The Monroe Institute
          </p>
          <p>
            This book was written specifically for those people for whom the
            question of "what is real" is the most important thing in life. It
            is for those who have a hard time concentrating on career or
            family--or anything--for fear it will turn out to be illusory. It is
            for anyone whose life is haunted by lack of meaning. The entire
            point of <i>Muddy Tracks</i> is that the author went out searching.
            He trusted, and sincerely looked, and found that his trust was
            rewarded. And, he says, as his trust was rewarded, so will yours be.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Muddy Tracks</i> tells some of the things that happened to him,
            and at every step he says to you, "Here's a resource; try this.
            Here's a resource; try that. When I did this, this happened. When I
            did that; that happened." Keeping strictly to what he has
            experienced, DeMarco shows how many aids we may find in life. He
            shows how his life was enriched by selected reading, and by dream
            analysis, and by interaction with friends and so-called strangers.
            He describes some of the unusual resources he has discovered and
            used, particularly in connection with out-of-body explorer Bob
            Monroe and The Monroe Institute.
          </p>
          <p>
            More intimately, he tells of some of the nearly unbelievable things
            he has learned to do--things, he points out, that are natural human
            abilities, available to all. As noted British author Colin Wilson
            says in his introduction, "Frank's experience has been in many ways
            remarkable, and he has a natural gift for making it come alive."
          </p>
          <p>
            The net result is to provide the reader with firsthand, informed
            reassurance that we all have our own internal guidance, which is
            reliable and is willing and able to come forth when welcomed.
            DeMarco cites his own experiences to argue that if you come to the
            quest in faith, the faith will be rewarded. The meaning of your life
            can be found, but it can only be found by you yourself. And, having
            found it, you will find it meaningful precisely because it will be
            your meaning, and not someone else's.
          </p>
          <p>
            The age of gurus is over. It is time for us each to come into our
            own. Muddy Tracks will help you--and encourage you--to learn to do
            that.
