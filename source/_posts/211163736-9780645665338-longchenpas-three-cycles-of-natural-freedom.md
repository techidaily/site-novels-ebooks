          Longchenpa' s Three Cycles of Natural Freedom: Oral translation and
          commentary is a seminal Dzogchen text that is divided into three
          cycles: Mind, Ultimate Reality and Equality. The ninth Traleg Kyabgon
          Rinpoche (1959– 2012) of the Kagyu Nyingma tradition, one of the great
          meditation master and scholars to come out of the Tibetan diaspora,
          has provided a detailed oral commentary and spontaneous translation of
          Longchenpa' s text to help reveal the essential meaning of these
          profound teachings. A glimpse at each cycle - in the Mind Cycle,
          Longchenpa is in part concerned with our ability to comprehend and
          experience the freedom within the authentic state; in the Ultimate
          Reality Cycle, all dualistic notions are challenged as the nature of
          self and phenomena are revealed as the same; in the Equality Cycle,
          our aboriginal state is described as that which transcends conditioned
          existence. Within each cycle, Lonchenpa also gives concise guidelines
          on approaching one' s practice within a retreat situation. Traleg
          Kyabgon Rinpoche' s renowned fluency with the English language,
          coupled with his own profound levels of realization, makes this
          translation an exciting opportunity for these transformative teachings
          to not only be known, but also experienced in these modern times.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche IX (1955-2012) was born in Nangchen in Kham,
          eastern Tibet. He was recognized by His Holiness XVI Gyalwang Karmapa
          as the ninth Traleg tulku and enthroned at the age of two as the
          supreme abbot of Thrangu Monastery. Rinpoche was taken to Rumtek
          Monastery in Sikkim at the age of four where he was educated with
          other young tulkus in exile by His Holiness Karmapa. Rinpoche studied
          under the auspices of His Eminence Kyabje Thuksey Rinpoche at Sangngak
          Choling in Darjeeling. He also studied with a number of other eminent
          Tibetan teachers during that time and mastered the many Tibetan
          teachings with the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions in particular.
          Rinpoche moved to Melbourne Australia in 1980 and commenced studies in
          comparative religion and philosophy at LaTrobe University. He
          established E-Vam Institute in Melbourne in 1982 and went on to
          establish further Centers in Australia, America and New Zealand.
          Throughout his life Rinpoche gave extensive teachings on many aspects
          of Buddhist psychology and philosophy, as well as comparative
          religion, and Buddhist and Western thought. He was an active writer
          and has many titles to his name. Titles include: the best selling
          Essence of Buddhism; Karma, What It Is, What It Isn't, and Why It
          Matters, now translated into 5 languages; The Practice of Lojong;
          Moonbeams of Mahamudra; and many more. Rinpoche's writings are thought
          provoking, challenging, profound and highly relevant to today's world
          and its many challenges. Traleg Kyabgon (1955– 2012) was the founder
          of the Kagyu E-Vam Buddhist Institute, which is headquartered in
          Melbourne. He taught extensively at universities and Buddhist centers
          in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia, and
          is the author of such books as Integral Buddhsim, Song Of Karmapa,
          Letter To A Friend, King Doha, Essence of Buddhism and Karma: What It
          Is, What It Isn't, Why It Matters.
