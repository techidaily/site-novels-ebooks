            >An accessible guide from an expert on Mindfulness on how to get the
            most out of meditation--and make the practice a permanent part of
            your daily life.</b
          ><br /><br />Meditation is supposed to be a practice that's relaxing
          and beneficial...so why is it so hard to commit to?<br /><br />
          While many people have taken workshops in meditation, a significant
          number don't maintain their practice for long after the class is
          finished. Mindfulness can help us relax and is great for coming to
          grips with thoughts that make us&nbsp; depressed or anxious, but it
          can also bring us into a more intimate relationship with ourselves--a
          prospect that can make some feel uncomfortable. Yes, lots of good
          things come out of meditation practice, but keeping it up is
          challenging. <br /><br />
          This is where <i>Why Can't I Meditate?</i> comes in. Full of practical
          ways to help our mindfulness practice flourish, it also features
          guidance from a wide spectrum of secular and Buddhist mindfulness
          teachers, and personal accounts by new meditators on what they find
          difficult and what helps them overcome those blocks. It takes what is
          boring, painful, or downright scary about meditating and shows how
          these struggles can become an invaluable part of our path. If you have
          been considering meditating but doubted your ability, if you are
          having a hard time continuing, or if you've reluctantly stopped,
          <i>Why Can't I Meditate?</i> will help you get your mindfulness
          practice back on track.

          "<i>Why &nbsp;Can’t &nbsp;I Meditate? </i>is, as far as I know, the
          first in-depth and pragmatic analysis of a key issue that bedevils
          many people who undertake the practice of meditation. It is not at all
          uncommon for someone to encounter a deep resistance to meditation even
          though they are sincerely committed to it. This important study is an
          invaluable handbook that provides practical &nbsp;guidance and advice
          for anyone who strives to understand and overcome the obstacles that
          prevent meditation from becoming an integral part of one’s
          &nbsp;life."<br /><b>—Stephen Batchelor,</b> author of
          <i>Buddhism without Beliefs&nbsp;</i>and
          <i>Confession of a Buddhist &nbsp;Atheist</i><br /><br />"I am very
          happy to finally see someone writing about why people can’t meditate.
          I’ve known Nigel for &nbsp;many years; he’s a sincere practitioner who
          has been thinking about how to untangle the blockages in the human
          mind for some time now. We had a lot of discussion together about the
          ideas presented here and I think his book will be very useful. It’s
          helpful to know the underlying causes of meditation problems—this book
          shows how to work with them."<br /><b>—Tsoknyi Rinpoche,</b> author,
          <i>Open Heart, Open Mind</i><br /><br />"People learning mindfulness
          often ask, 'I know mindfulness practice is helpful, how can I best
          establish my meditation practice?' Now I can recommend this wonderful
          book. Nigel Wellings offers insightful, compassionate and eminently
          practical guidance, based on his extensive personal experience as a
          teacher and practitioner and interviews with some of the most
          accomplished mindfulness teachers in the &nbsp;field."<br /><b

          .insightful and helpful. I really like the discussion of the different
          selves within us and how one can be in conflict with another and that
          people who are fearful of unknown parts of themselves, their shadow,
          are going to struggle with compassion, becoming caught up in conflicts
          and struggles in contrast to observing them as 'nature’s mind at
          work.'"<br /><b>—Professor Paul Gilbert, PhD, &nbsp;OBE,</b> author
          of&nbsp;<i>The Compassionate Mind and Mindful &nbsp;Compassion</i
          ><br /><br />"I especially appreciate the explicit kindness and
          compassion part of the book, it’s a beautiful chapter and it unpacks
          very nicely the threats that &nbsp;people feel when they give
          themselves love.&nbsp; &nbsp;As we say in the MSC program, 'When you
          give yourself unconditional love, you discover the &nbsp;conditions
          under which you felt unloved.'"<br /><b>—Christopher Germer, PhD,</b
          >&nbsp;clinical psychologist and author of
          <i>The Mindful &nbsp;Path to Self-compassion</i><br /><br />
          <br />"I would rate this book as essential reading for anyone who
          already has a meditation practice or for someone wanting to begin one.
          Reading it is like being in deep conversation with the author—an
          experienced and helpful person who really understands the process and
          pitfalls of meditation—and also with many others who share their
          experiences with refreshing honesty. The text offers the reader
          details of the practicalities of meditation, such as how to
          &nbsp;explore motivation to start, where and how to sit or walk, and
          how often, and it also offers &nbsp;a deep understanding of the
          difficulties that can be encountered in a way that is compassionate,
          easily understood and helpful."<br /><b
