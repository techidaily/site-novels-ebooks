              >'What if the suffering that we call depression contains
              experiences and lessons without which we cannot be fully
              alive?'</i
            ></b
          ><br /><br />This is one of the many startling questions that
          <i>Giving Up Without Giving Up</i> invites us to ask ourselves.
          Depression seems to be a contemporary epidemic, a condition
          understandably feared and avoided by all. Yet this book explores the
          possibility that we have much to learn from the desert times in our
          lives, when it feels as though we are losing everything, most of all
          any sense of who we are.<br /><br />Drawing on his extensive
          experience of meditation within both the Buddhist and Christian
          contemplative traditions, as well as his own times of personal loss
          and bewilderment, Jim Green offers us a moving account of just how
          this wisdom practice can accompany each of us as we make 'the gentle
          pilgrimage of recovery' He guides us through 'the invention of
          depression' in the mid-twentieth century, questioning the increasing
          tendency to medicalize human suffering.<br /><br />Based on the
          insight that 'Life is the Treatment', he offers a thorough and
          practical approach to our times of personal desolation, showing how we
          can learn to treat ourselves and each other with care and compassion.
          At the heart of this approach is the practice of meditation, learned
          from the Buddha, The Desert Fathers and Mothers and from Jesus
          himself.<br /><br />It's a practice which, this heartfelt book
          insists, can help you 'to be depressed – which might mean in mourning
          – <i>for exactly as long as you need to be</i>, no longer and no
          shorter. Then, changed, you are brought back to life, which is change
          itself.'

          The beguiling title of Jim Green's book both conceals and reveals its
          revolutionary nature. In beautifully crafted prose, he challenges his
          readers to let go of their pre-suppositions, habitual attitudes and
          conditioned responses to life's existential sufferings. Above all, he
          offers a path out of the prison of dualistic thinking. Meditation, he
          suggests, leads into the heart of paradox where nothing gives access
          to everything.
