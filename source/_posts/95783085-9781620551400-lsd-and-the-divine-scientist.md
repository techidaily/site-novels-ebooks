          The acclaimed discoverer of LSD’s personal experiences and thoughts on
          chemistry, the natural sciences, mind-altering drugs, the soul, and
          the search for happiness <br />
          <br />• Shares a different side of the father of LSD, one known only
          to his friends and close colleagues <br />
          <br />• Explains Hofmann’s different methods of pharmaceutical
          research based on traditional plant medicine <br />
          <br />• Includes the poetry of this mystical prophet of psychedelic
          science <br />
          <br />Best known as the first person to synthesize, ingest, and
          discover the psychedelic effects of LSD, Albert Hofmann was more than
          just a chemist. A pioneer in the field of visionary plant research, he
          was one of the first people to suggest the use of entheogens for
          psychological healing and spiritual growth. His insights into the
          consciousness-expanding effects of psychedelics as well as human
          nature, the psyche, and the nature of reality earned him a reputation
          as a mystical scientist and visionary philosopher. <br />
          <br />This book--Hofmann’s last work before his death in 2008 at the
          age of 102--offers the acclaimed scientist’s personal experiences and
          thoughts on chemistry, the natural sciences, mind-altering drugs, the
          soul, and the search for happiness and meaning in life. Hofmann
          explains different methods of pharmaceutical research based on
          traditional plant medicine and discusses psilocybin, the active
          compound in psychedelic mushrooms that he discovered. He examines the
          psychological role of psychoactives, their therapeutic potential, and
          their use in easing the life-to-death transition. Sharing a different
          side of the father of LSD, one known only to his friends and close
          colleagues, this book also includes the poetry of this mystical
          prophet of psychedelic science.

          “An extraordinary quality of Albert Hofmann was his ability to
          integrate the spiritual and the material under the conceptual umbrella
          of the natural. As his last work,
          <i>LSD and the Divine Scientist</i> presents Hofmann’s most mature
          thought, the flowering of the scientist as philosopher in a natural
          integration of science and philosophy. May these final essays be the
          key to achieving Hofmann’s ultimate vision.”
