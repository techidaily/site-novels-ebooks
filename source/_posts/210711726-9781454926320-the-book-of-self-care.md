          ><br /><br />Never has the idea of mindfully checking in with
          ourselves and creating “whole body” health—well-being that is more
          than simply the absence of illness—been so appealing. In this guide to
          self-care, wellness and beauty educator Mary Beth Janssen reveals how
          introspection, ritual, and love can help cure existential woes. She
          profiles a wide range of activities and exercises, including:Karma
          Cleanse: How to cultivate/give loving-kindness, compassion, and
          forgiveness in yourself, and then pay it forward.Intention,
          Meditation, and Breathwork Techniques: Exercises for calm and centered
          living.Emotional Housecleaning: How to deal with unprocessed emotions
          “stuck” within yourself.Setting Healthy Boundaries: Check-in exercises
          for relationships that will help you reevaluate and build your support
          network.Tips for nourishing yourself, deep sleep, and beauty rituals
          to celebrate your body.<br /><br />Real wellness isn’t just the
          absence of injury or illness: it’s a&nbsp;<i>”whole body”</i
          >&nbsp;approach to health that anyone can add to their daily lives.
          Mary Beth Janssen, an experienced consultant on alternative medicine,
          shares a consciousness- and compassion-based system for navigating
          wholeness in mind, body, and soul.<br /><br /><b
            >“Follow her step by step instructions for a number of contemplative
            practices and become exquisitely mindful in your day to day
            life—thus more apt to make the most life-affirming choices possible.
            She advocates that from this place, we experience more groundedness,
            balance and joy.” —<i>Mother Earth Living</i></b
