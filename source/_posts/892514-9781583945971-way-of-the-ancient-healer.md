            path toward health and happiness.” —Deepak Chopra</b
          ><i><br /><br />Way of the Ancient Healer</i> provides an overview of
          the rich tradition of Filipino healing practices, discussing their
          origins, world influences, and role in daily life. Enhanced with over
          200 photographs and illustrations, the book combines years of
          historical research with detailed descriptions of the spiritual belief
          system that forms the foundation of these practices. Giving readers a
          rare look at modern-day Filipino healing rituals, the book also
          includes personal examples from author Virgil Mayor Apostol’s own
          experiences with shamanic healing and dream interpretation.<br /><br />The
          book begins with an explanation of Apostol’s Filipino lineage and
          legacy as a healer. After a brief history of the Philippine
          archipelago, he describes the roots of traditional Filipino healing
          and spirituality, and discusses the Indian, Islamic, Chinese,
          Japanese, Spanish, and American influences that have impacted the
          Filipino culture. He presents a thorough description of Filipino
          shamanic and spiritual practices that have developed from the concept
          that everything in nature contains a spirit (animism) and that living
          in the presence of spirits demands certain protocols and rituals for
          interacting with them. The book’s final chapter thoughtfully explores
          the spiritual tools used in Filipino healing–talismans, amulets,
          stones, and other natural symbols of power.

          "In <i>Way of the Ancient Healer</i>, Virgil Mayor Apostol brilliantly
          blends the art and science of the sacred teachings of Filipino
          traditional healing to help people find their path toward health and
          happiness."<br />—Deepak Chopra, author,
          <i>Reinventing the Body, Resurrecting the Soul<br /><br /></i>“The
          recent upsurge of interest and research into the connection between
          the mind and body that reaches into the spiritual, a largely ignored
          realm for decades, shows that science acknowledges that there is much
          that we do not yet know. The mechanisms that link the nervous system,
          immune system, and endocrine system have only begun to be understood,
          and it is perhaps this avenue that will fruitfully provide the initial
          understanding of the link between spirituality and health, and the
          secrets of these healing traditions, including Filipino healing as
          presented in this book.”<br />—Edward K. Fujimoto, DrPH, former
          professor of the DrPH Program in Preventive Care, Loma Linda
          University <br /><br />“This brilliant and powerful work is a must for
          everyone in the healing arts as well as those who would increase the
          depth and breadth of their humanity. It is not only the first major
          study of the extraordinary practices of the visionary healers of the
          Philippines, but offers the reader inner knowledge of human
          possibilities once thought to be mythic, now shown to be real.”<br />—Jean
          Houston, PhD, founder of Mystery School, Ashland, Oregon, and author
          of <i>A Mythic Life: Learning to Live Our Greater Story</i
          ><br /><br />“Interest in complimentary and alternative therapies is
          on the rise, and Virgil Mayor Apostol’s
          <i>Way of the Ancient Healer</i> is a fascinating cross-cultural
          exploration of the nature of health, illness, and healing in the
          Philippine tradition that will be of special interest to those
          reconsidering the methodologies of traditional shamans for healing and
          problem-solving.”<br />—Hank Wesselman, PhD, anthropologist and author
          of <i>Spiritwalker: Messages from the Future</i> and
          <i
