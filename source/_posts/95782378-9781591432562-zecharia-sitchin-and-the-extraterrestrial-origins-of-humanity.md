          An in-depth analysis of Sitchin’s revelations about the Anunnaki,
          early humanity, and Earth’s future<br /><br />• Examines Sitchin’s
          research into the Anunnaki arrival on Earth, the lineage of the
          Nefilim, their space travel technology, and their creation of modern
          humans<br /><br />• Written by longtime Sitchin friend and colleague
          M. J. Evans, Ph.D., and draws upon her research and personal
          discussions with Sitchin<br /><br />• Explores the lust and lovemaking
          relationships of the Nefilim and suggests we inherited our warlike and
          love making tendencies from them<br /><br />Known for his provocative
          interpretations of ancient Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets,
          Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010) read the words of our most ancient
          ancestors as fact and, through decades of meticulous research, showed
          that these ancient tablets revealed a coherent narrative about the
          extraterrestrial inhabitants of Earth and the origins of modern
          humanity.<br /><br />Drawing upon her many conversations with Zecharia
          Sitchin over nearly 20 years, M. J. Evans, Ph.D., longtime Sitchin
          friend and colleague, provides an in-depth analysis of Sitchin’s
          revelations about the Anunnaki, focusing on Anunnaki activities on
          Earth and Earth’s future. She explores the genesis of Sitchin’s
          interest in the Nefilim, the leaders of the Anunnaki, and the
          controversy caused by the publication of Sitchin’s first book,
          <i>The 12th Planet</i>. She examines Sitchin’s research into the
          Nefilim family tree, the Anunnaki arrival on Earth to mine gold to
          repair the atmosphere on their planet, Nibiru, and their creation of
          modern humans as workers for their mines and to build their
          civilization on Earth. She shows how, in the context of 21st-century
          technological capabilities, Sitchin’s work casts a different light on
          ancient events, with implications for our future. The author reveals
          the details of the love and lust proclivities of the Nefilim gods Anu,
          Enlil, and Enki and the goddess Ishtar/Inanna and shows how we
          inherited these tendencies from our Anunnaki creators as well as their
          use of war for problem solving.<br /><br />Concluding with an
          examination of Sitchin’s prediction of a nuclear event on Earth in
          2024 AD, she shows how we would be repeating the aggressive warlike
          behaviors of our Anunnaki creators, who may very well become our
          saviors when Nibiru next returns to our solar system.

          “No other modern thinker has offered a more compelling, coherent, and
          influential explanation of humanity’s origins than Zecharia Sitchin.
          Millions of people make sense of the human experience through the lens
          of his discoveries and findings. Now, thankfully, M. J. Evans has done
          us all the favor of distilling Sitchin’s work into a very readable
          compendium. We should all be very grateful.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          M. J. EVANS, Ph.D., (1933-2022) was a professor emeritus at SUNY
          Empire State College, where she taught environmental geography for 30
          years. A friend and colleague of Zecharia Sitchin for nearly 20 years,
          she accompanied Sitchin on several tours to ancient sites in the
          Mediterranean region, Europe, and Mexico and had appeared on the TV
          show <i>Ancient Aliens </i>to discuss Sitchin’s work. She spent most
          of each year in Turkey, where she studied ancient sites and
          landscapes.
