              >Cristi Christensen's <i>Chakra Rituals</i> is a book that makes
              the ancient science of Chakras accessible to spiritually conscious
              women, and offers a seven-week step-by-step program.</b
            ><br /><br />Learn how to tap into the single most perfect system
            living inside of each of us—the seven Chakras.<br /><br />While
            Chakras have become trendy, sexy, cool, and very spiritual, few
            people today really know how to activate the Chakras’ powerful
            energy for deep transformation. Cristi Christensen aims to change
            that, and <i>Chakra Rituals</i> offers readers a multi-dimensional,
            practical, and inspiring structured seven-week step-by-step program.
            Each week, readers are instructed how to activate a different
            Chakra, and each weekday they are led through a dynamic, easy, and
            motivating practice (altar building; breathing; meditation; vinyasa
            yoga flow, mudra, writing contemplation, and embodiment) which
            distills the esoteric concepts and makes them tangible, living
            experiences. A self-discovery and self-help guide with striking
            full-color illustrations, <i>Chakra Rituals </i>employs the Chakras’
            potential to open the pathways to a full, enlightened “aliveness.”
            Seasoned practitioners and newcomers alike are invited to flow with
            their emotions, claim their power, transform their lives, and align
            with the divine.

          "<i>Chakra Rituals </i>is a lush, intimate, and beautifully written
          book that illustrates how to create a daily spiritual practice using
          yoga asana, chakras, mantras, self-inquiry, and other healing
          modalities. Cristi’s explanation of these various esoteric and
          embodied teachings is accessible, well-informed, and deeply
          meaningful, but what makes this book so special is that it is not just
          theoretical, it is experiential. <i>Chakra Rituals</i> provides
          step-by-step instructions on how to transform your daily practice on
          the mat into a sacred ritual and a holistic expression of devotion
          that connects you to the Divine within...and within all. Please read
          this very special book if you are looking to add some extra sparkle,

          powerful movements, Cristi's capacity to teach the chakras in an
          accessible, relevant way will shift your understanding and enhance

          <i>The Radiance Sutras</i> that inspire wild wonder and awe. Return to
          this guidebook again and again as your life unfolds, and find deeper

          book is a must-have for anyone ready to dive into the mystical world

          is the book that we all need right now. In these words, Cristi
          Christensen enters your home with the attitude of an encouraging best
          friend. But not just an ordinary best friend. She is a joyful and
          expansive bringer of radiance and a guide for creativity.
          <i>Chakra Rituals</i> is a magic guidebook for the embodied
          experience. Don’t just read it (now!). Do the practices, say the
          prayers, contemplate the meditations she offers, use the writing
          prompts in your journal, and awaken. Oh, and revel in the ecstasy of
          your own shakti, your own vitality and energy."--Felicia Tomasko,
          Editor in Chief, LA YOGA Magazine <br /><br />"Cristi brings a new

          clear perspective on this often mystical subject is refreshing and
          applicable to the modern day woman." -Kino MacGregor, author, founder
          of Omstars<br /><br />"Cristi Christensen will transform your life.
          Her work is luminary, practical, and easy to digest for people of all
          backgrounds. Of all of the chakra books I've ever read, this is the
          best one. While <i>Chakra Rituals</i> is indeed a book for women, I
          had the gift of reading it from cover to cover, and as a male, I was
          surprised to see just how much it awakened within me as well. Cristi's
          voice is a poetic light in these dark times. We are in desperate need
          to awaken the divine feminine energy on this planet, and I could not
          think of a better time than now for women to read this book. It's time
          to wake up to your true authentic power and brilliance, for the
          benefit of all—Cristi will guide the way."--Justin Michael Williams,
          Global Speaker and Musician, author of <i>Stay Woke</i>

          the world today. In this book Cristi deploys her insights on
          liberation, aliveness and wholeness to offer women an exciting roadmap
          for embodying love, confidence and courage.”--Sebastian Siegel,
          writer, director, author <br /><br />“With just the right mix of
          transformative and heartfelt personal stories, powerful Yogic myths,
          and a step by step guide to help you move through the timeless and
          potent cycles of the 7 chakras, Cristi ushers you to Do Something! and
          enter your truest, most evolved and yes, wildest self.”--Annie
          Carpenter, Internationally acclaimed yoga teacher, Founder of Smart
          flow <br /><br />"As an advocate for true liberation for all women, I
          understand that deep and lasting transformation only happens through
          full integration of the mind, body, and spirit. For many of us, that
          part is easy to understand, but we struggle with what this looks like
          in our day-to-day life. What Christensen has so brilliantly done in
          <i>Chakra Rituals</i>, is provide a simple, yet profound guide for how
          to connect with your chakras and awaken the Wild Woman that is within
          us all."--Shelah Marie, Founder of The Curvy, Curly, Conscious
          Movement <br /><br />"Turning the pages of <i>Chakra Rituals</i> is
          like walking side by side with Cristi through her 20-year journey of
          personal evolution (rooted in masterfully teaching movement and
          meditation worldwide), where we learn and awaken our potential with
          each meaningful step. She has created an actionable system for
          building a life of pure love, deep purpose, complete fulfillment and
          unbridled joy. Cristi certainly delivers on her promise of giving you
          the tools to transform your life and create lasting change.
          <i>Chakra Rituals</i> is not a book you will read once and move on
          from, it is a resource that you will return to for constant
          inspiration."--Kira Stokes, Fitness Expert, Creator of The Stoked
          Method and Kira Stokes Fit App<br /><br />"<i>Chakra Rituals </i>is
          equal parts nurturing retreat and adventure into the wild. Cristi
          Christensen makes what can seem esoteric and illusive completely
          accessible and actionable...even for a self-proclaimed less-than-wild
          woman like me."--Andrea Marcum author of <i>Close to Om</i
          ><br /><br />"Cristi Christensen is a force of nature. As a teacher,
          she ignites powerful joy in her students with fiery, loving energy.
          Her new book is bursting with her vibrant messages of self healing,
          women’s empowerment and personal transformation. She offers us
          grounded practices and nourishing rituals with the stunning beauty and
          elegant style that is classically Cristi. If you are new to studying
          the Chakra system, Cristi gives you an accessible map and visceral

          full on!"—Toni Bergins, creator of JourneyDance (TM) and Embodied
          Transformation Method Coaching<br /><br />"Cristi is a splash of
          crimson in a world of grey, and her vibrant approach illuminates an
          ancient practice in a respectful and modern way.”--Kathryn Budig,
          author of <i>Aim True</i> &amp; global yoga teacher <br /><br />"As a
          fellow lover of the chakras and their profound way of communicating
          with us I can say Cristi is the embodiment of full chakra expression
          on every level. She is deeply grounded, expressive, powerful,
          heart-centered, vocal, intuitive and divine guided. You are in for a
          treat as you journey with her into your own full expression and
          embodiment of your highest self." --Koya Webb, International Holistic
          Health Coach and Author <br /><br />"Women are increasingly finding
          their strength, their power, their worth, and in some cases, their
          wildness, as in freeing themselves to fully live their unlimited
          potential. In Chakra Rituals: Awakening The Wild Woman Within, Cristi
          brings forth the Ageless Wisdom traditions that allow women to
          rediscover and liberate the fire within them by embracing the real
          meanings of the chakra system, mudras, yoga, and other time-tested
          methods of spiritual liberation. Read this book and release your inner
          splendor!"--Michael Bernard Beckwith<br />Founder &amp; Spiritual
          Director, Agape International Spiritual Center and author of
          <i>Life Visioning</i> and <i>Spiritual Liberation </i><br /><br />“My
          fourth chakra is bursting with joy after exploring my untamed inner
          wildness, with Cristi’s accessible and empowering daily rituals. More
          than just a heartfelt nd riveting read, this book is actually a portal
          to your truest, most vibrant self.”--Elise Joan, Beach Body Super
          Trainer, Creator of Barrelend, Global Wellness Leader<br /><br />"Chakras
