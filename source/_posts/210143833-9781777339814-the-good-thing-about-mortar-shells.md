            on the birds singing in the background during their international
            phone call.&nbsp;She was on the roof top of her apartment in Syria
            during the civil war. A place everyone was running away from and a
            place where she was working as a humanitarian, trying to advocate
            for love and compassion.

            love, Jennifer demonstrates in this book, that even in the darkest
            places, there is kindness, compassion, hope, and the possibility for
            happiness.
