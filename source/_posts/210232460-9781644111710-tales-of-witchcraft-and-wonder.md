          • Offers commentary for each story, revealing its historical context,
          cultural and esoteric associations, and hidden pagan beliefs
          <br /><br />• Explores how the tales transformed over the ages and
          their origins in Classical Antiquity, the Middle East, and India
          <br /><br />• Includes stories never-before-translated from their
          original Latin and many purposely left in obscurity due to scandalous
          depictions of popes and other notables <br /><br />The Middle Ages
          witnessed the blossoming of oral traditions whose echoes can still be
          found in many legends, fables, and tales today.<br /><br />In this
          collection of medieval tales of witchcraft, wonder, and the
          supernatural, Claude and Corinne Lecouteux explain how many of these
          stories arose in Classical Antiquity while some made their way into
          Dark Ages Europe from the Middle East and India. Offering commentary
          for each tale, the authors place them in historical context and
          analyze their cultural and esoteric associations. They include stories
          never- before-translated from their original Latin or demotic versions
          and show how, unlike the well-known fairy tales made popular by the
          Brothers Grimm, many stories were purposely left in obscurity because
          they presented scandalous depictions of popes and other notables.
          Additionally, for many of the tales, the authors scrupulously peel
          back the Christian veneer to show how the stories were instrumental in
          assuring the survival of age-old pagan beliefs across the centuries.
          <br /><br />These beliefs are explored through tales of animals with
          magical powers and the ability to converse with humans, including the
          tale of the Grateful Lion made famous through Aesop’s fables; stories
          of individuals with supernatural or otherworldly powers, like the
          Venomous Maiden who poisons all men who have relations with her;
          legends of miracles and wondrous things that violate the laws of
          nature, such as people returning from the dead to help a descendant;
          and stories of witchcraft, magic, and demonic apparitions, including
          the pope who was a disguised demon. The authors also explore tales of
          supernatural spouses and illicit love affairs, wisdom teachings and
          parables of fools, and heroic legends.

          “Claude and Corinne Lecouteux’s
          <i>Tales of Witchcraft and Wonder</i> is a scholarly but accessible
          study of the tales, stories, and fables that circulated and were
          popular in the European Middle Ages. What links them is a magical
          worldview that connects humans directly with elemental forces and the
          worlds of eldritch spirits and intelligent animals.
          <i>Tales of Witchcraft and Wonder</i> also contains many lesser-known
          but compelling tales that re-create the spirit of uncanny human
          experience in former times.”
