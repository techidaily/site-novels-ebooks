          <p>
            In the second half of the twentieth century, Reiki went from an
            obscure therapy practiced by a few thousand Japanese and Japanese
            Americans to a global phenomenon. By the early twenty-first century,
            people in nearly every corner of the world have undergone the
            initiations that authorize them to channel a cosmic energy—known as
            Reiki—to heal body, mind, and spirit. They lay hands on themselves
            and others, use secret symbols and incantations to send Reiki to
            distant recipients, and strive to follow five precepts to cultivate
            their spiritual growth. Reiki’s international rise and development
            is due to the work of Hawayo Takata (1900–1980), a Hawai‘i-born
            Japanese American woman who brought Reiki out of Japan and adapted
            it for thousands of students in Hawai‘i and North America, shaping
            interconnections across the North Pacific region as well as cultural
            transformations over the transwar period spanning World War II.<br /><br />
            <i
              >Alternate Currents: Reiki’s Circulation in the Twentieth-Century
              North Pacific</i
            >
            analyzes how, from her training in Japan in the mid-1930s to her
            death in Iowa in 1980, Takata built a vast trans-Pacific network
            that connected Japanese American laborers on plantations in Hawai‘i
            to social elites in Tokyo, Hollywood, and New York; middle-class
            housewives in American suburbs; and off-the-grid tree planters in
            the mountains of British Columbia. Using recently uncovered archival
            materials and original oral histories, Justin B. Stein examines how
            these relationships between healer and patient, master and disciple,
            became deeply infused with values of their time and place and how
            they interplayed with Reiki’s circulation, performance, and meanings
            along with broader cultural shifts in the twentieth-century North
            Pacific. Highly readable and informative, each chapter is structured
            around a period in the life of Takata, the charismatic,
            rags-to-riches architect of the network in which Reiki spread for
            decades. <i>Alternate Currents</i> explores Reiki as an exemplary
            transnational spiritual therapy, demonstrating how lived practices
            transcend artificial distinctions between religion and medicine, and
            circulate in global systems while maintaining strong connections
            with the practices’ homeland.

          This clear-eyed and exceptionally well-organized study of
          transnational spiritual therapies will be a revelatory work for
          specialists and general audiences alike interested in the rise of "new
          age" phenomena, beliefs, and practices in the mid- to late twentieth
          century. One of its key insights, that transnational spiritual
          therapies engage in "particular universalism," (i.e., privileging the
          cultures and values of the "original" locale while claiming universal
          applicability), which can result in an erasure or occlusion of
          influences from outside the original locale, is potentially very
          useful for studies of a wide range of cultural phenomena.
