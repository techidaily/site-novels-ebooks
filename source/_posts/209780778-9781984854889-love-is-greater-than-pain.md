            >An extraordinary new mindful approach to healing after loss that

            those who have passed.</b

            >“Marilyn’s vast and masterful experience in communicating with

          ><br /><br />When Marilyn Kapp was two years old, she watched her
          grandfather leave his body. He told her he would be back and he was
          true to his word. When Marilyn realized that others did not share her
          perception of the spiritual plane, she kept her channeling abilities
          to herself and her family. This changed when, as a college student,
          she met writer, Holocaust survivor, and future Nobel laureate Elie
          Wiesel. He became her mentor and encouraged her to use her perception
          to help others.<br /><br />In&nbsp;<i>Love Is Greater Than Pain,</i
          >&nbsp;Marilyn shares her profound understanding of the afterlife.
          Today a renowned medium, Marilyn reveals the beauty in the transition
          from the physical to the spiritual plane, helping those who are dying,
          as well as those left behind. With personal stories and transcripts
          from channeling sessions, Marilyn teaches us how to interact with the
          afterlife and to joyfully embrace the reality that love truly is
          greater than pain.<br /><br />Marilyn shares universal messages of
          comfort, forgiveness, and understanding, including specific guidance
          for bereaved parents, for those dealing with dementia, and even for
          people who are grieving for their animal friends.
          <br /><br />Marilyn’s groundbreaking seminal work offers practical
          advice, clear takeaways, and a new approach to death, grieving, and
          living your best life, sharing concrete steps for:<br />• Raising your
          personal vibration to increase health, joy, and the ability to receive
          channeled information and love.<br />• Helping yourself and others
          honor life while grieving.<br />• Understanding the parallel process
          of growth that we share with those who have passed.<br /><br />When we
          honor life as we grieve, we offer healing and support to one another,
          as well as conscious collaboration with those who have passed.

          “<i>Love is Greater Than Pain</i>&nbsp;is soothing comfort for the
          pain of loss—a pain that escapes no one here on this Earth plane. At
          some level, no one ever dies. And we can be in touch with them always.
          But to be human is to miss those who have left us physically.&nbsp;<i
            >Love is Greater Than Pain</i
          >&nbsp;is a bridge that helps bridge our physical reality to the
          spiritual reality of no death and no loss. I highly recommend the
          comfort found in these pages!”<b

            >and <i>Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Marilyn’s book beautifully validates what I have learned
          in my journey as a hospice social worker: how our loved ones leave
          this earth plane, how we make peace with them and their death, and how
          we integrate the love we had for them—it all matters. Even if our
          relationships were fraught with ambivalence and pain, how we forgive
          them and ourselves influences our lives moving forward. Marilyn’s vast
          and masterful experience in communicating with passed loved ones
          illustrate what they want to teach us. Through love, everything is
          possible, and through love, we can heal our wounded hearts and
          souls.”<b>—Betty Jampel, LCSW<br /></b><br />“As a therapist, I work
          with people who often have PTSD, depression, anxiety, or are simply
          feeling stuck. I’ve seen the insight that clients have gained from
          Marilyn’s spiritual gift—many have described the experience of working
          with Marilyn as life changing—and I am extremely grateful that Marilyn
          is now sharing that same healing gift with the world in her book,
          <i>Love Is Greater Than Pain.</i>”<b>—Marie Moore, PsyD</b
          ><br /><br />“Marilyn Kapp’s book, <i>Love Is Greater Than Pain</i>,
          is a generous offering to the world in a time when it needs guidance
          through grief more than ever. My family and I have known Marilyn for
          over twenty years. She is a talented medium whose connection with the
          afterlife has helped countless people through grief and the
          rediscovery of joy after a terrible loss. Marilyn offers a new
          perspective on death, one that allows you to heal alongside your loved
          one who has passed and stay connected with them. This is a life
          changing invitation for hope and healing.”<b>—Ed Begley Jr.</b
          ><br /><br />“Marilyn’s story and her incredible experience with those
          who are in body and out of body mesmerized me from the beginning. I
          can only imagine the comfort the reader will find after reading this
          book. Both life and death become more real and yet exciting with
          Marilyn’s insight and guidance. Love Is Greater Than Pain can help
          everyone, whether they have lost a child or a loved one, are afraid of
          death, or want to better understand this journey of life.”<b
