            We are living through a time of environmental and humanitarian
            disasters, underpinned by&nbsp;a crisis of consciousness.
            Communities are polarised and people isolated, despite our
            technological connectivity.

            The Compassionate Activist&nbsp;is for changemakers, meditators and
            activists, offering guidance to transform our wounded world from the
            inside out. What can we do in the midst of uncertainty and
            overwhelm? Attend to what is within us and around us,
            moment-by-moment.

          <p>
            This book is for all who see activism as a relational practice built
            on&nbsp;an ethic of care. It calls for engagement inspired by
            love&nbsp;not hate, and the mobilisation of communities through
            solidarity not separation.

          <p>
            Each chapter of this journey book offers ideas and practices from
            contemplative science, Buddhist philosophy and evolutionary
            psychology, to inspire inner reflection and outer action.
            Mindfulness meditations, engagement challenges and shadow work
            reflections are introduced to develop skills and insight. Readers
            are invited to reflect on their successes and struggles, and to take
            action steps, inspired by wholehearted intentions, to guide their
            own unique way forward.

          I would like to thank Lucy for the love, thought, intention, and
          courage, that went into the process of crafting this book. It is work
          that is so needed in our times.&nbsp;Thank you for sharing the wisdom
          of your heart. My wish is that this spreads far and wide.

          Lucy has the incredible gift of encouraging everyone around her to
          take the next daring step on their journey, both on and off the yoga
          mat or meditation cushion. She generously shares the wisdom and joy
          from her own practice and life experiences, and in this way, inspires
          others to follow their own path to growth. May this work bring
          possibility to many more aspiring movers and shakers in the world!

          I found this book invaluable in helping make sense of my difficult
          feelings in this time of international crisis. I highly recommend this
          book for those seeking wisdom and comfort in these times. Lucy's
          extensive mindfulness knowledge and intuitive insight helped me
          navigate myself back to calmness.

          I was burnt out and jaded from what felt like a losing battle working
          in communities and individual therapy. The "system" seemed

        <p>
          impenetrable, unsupportive, and hopeless. This book gave me new hope
          in the form of practical ways to sustain an activist stance with
          compassion, while finding ways forward despite the odds.
