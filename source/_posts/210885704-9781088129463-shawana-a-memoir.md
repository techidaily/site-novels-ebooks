          <p>
            Married at the early age of 22, with a husband and two kids by the
            time she turned 24, the young vibrant, confident, sexy, woman
            Shawana once was, had become non-existent. She was a mom and wife
            who devoted all of her love, time, and energy to her family and had
            no identity of her own.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            While cleaning her office, she came across two notebooks that she's
            had since she was a teenager. &nbsp;These weren't just any ordinary
            notebooks though. These notebooks held her inner thoughts and life
            experiences- written in the form of poetry- from the time she was
            just 14 years old. As she looked through the pages, she began to
            remember her dreams, her aspirations, and who she was beyond whom
            she became.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Her kids, now teenagers had become independent, and no longer needed
            her as much; so, she went back to what she loved, and she began to
            write, remember, and re-live each moment.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Shawana, A Memoir- is not just any poetry book. The poems in this
            book follow the real-life experiences that cultivated them.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Readers are invited on a journey through the author's life where
            they will have the opportunity to see through her eyes - with poems
            like "My First Time", "Love Without Losing Yourself", and "Can You
            See Me?". Her hope is that her readers gain more positive
            perspectives of their pasts, and realize that it's not too late to
            determine their futures.&nbsp;
