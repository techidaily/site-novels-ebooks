            I Looked in Your Eyes and Saw the Devil acknowledges the bad
            situations in life as well as the good circumstances. It’s called
            life, but to live our best lives, we must let go and let God. God
            wants us to be the best versions of ourselves. Those of us that are
            sick and tired of living an unfulfilled life, there’s hope. But our
            transformation is not going to happen to us overnight automatically.
            We have to put in the work and focus on our inner being. We go
            through some very tough times, but tough times should not last too
            long.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            People disrespect us and hurt us, and the lasting effects are
            overwhelming. When this happens, let us acknowledge the pain and
            hurt and take the much-needed time for a divine healing to take
            place and learn from it. It is all for the betterment of ourselves
            and for others. When a person stays down in a downtrodden condition,
            it’s likely going to be a very difficult task to recover from. It’s
            very damaging to the soul of a person. We are no less than damaged
            goods. Give yourselves a chance. We deserve to be loved and loved
            the right way.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            For those who are broken, disappointed, disgusted, and hurt and
            can’t seem to find a way out, please know that there is hope.
            Charissa Green shares her bad experiences with you and how she was
            able to overcome them. She also shares with her readers that there
            is so much power in love. Developing true love for God and ourselves
            is key when turning our lives around.
          </p>

            have a clear mind, faith in God, and the strength to defeat the hate
