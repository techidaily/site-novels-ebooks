            Right under your feet lies one of the best magickal tools a
            practitioner could use in their workings - dirt. Whether it comes
            from graveyards, footprints, crossroads, or elsewhere, the dirt from
            different places is a powerful aid in the magick to your workings.
            When we work with dirt, we’re working with one of the most
            fundamental elements of being human. From dust we appeared and to
            dust we shall return, the saying goes. Dirt creates a magickal,
            energetic link that heightens any endeavor. This element of earth
            brings a deep spiritual dynamic and connection to any working. Since
            it might be difficult to decide where to start - because dirt covers
            the planet, even under the oceans - author Taren S narrows the focus
            to specific magickal-spiritual locations, locations of merit and
            power, for you to collect your own dirt. Implementing dirt into
            magickal workings requires more skill than its availability would
            denote. Dirt workings involve the realms of light and dark magick,
            healing, curses, and death. This book will guide, help, and warn all
            those who wish to use dirt for magickal workings.

          Learning about magic can sometimes feel a little like reading a
          cookbook, but Conjuring Dirt manages to take an underserved and humble
          aspect of folk magic and give it new life. Taren acts as a tour guide
          or museum docent to the world of soils and dirts deployed for
          sorcerous purposes. This isn’t a by-the-numbers sort of tour, though,
          as Taren enlivens informative sections on graveyard dirt or working at
          the crossroads with stories drawn from history, folklore, and her own
          life. You learn about the uses of dirt taken from church grounds or
          courthouses, but also get the back story on a Beaufort, South Carolina
          politician who feared that people were hexing him using dirt from a
          local burnt-down church. She discusses using dirt from an enemy’s
          garden, and takes you to New Orleans and the “Father of the Garden
          District,” whose own botanical bounty was stolen away by his
          neighbors, piece by piece after his wife died. Like the very best
          guidebooks or local excursions, you’re accompanied by someone who
          answers your questions before you even ask them and who has a tale to
          tell, about every stop along the way that makes you feel like you’re
          getting the inside scoop. As a practical guide it’s full of useful
          tidbits, too, but the stories are what will keep you coming back to
          this compact-but-captivating little book.
