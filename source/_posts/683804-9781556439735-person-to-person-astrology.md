          Using a new language of energy based on the ancient “four elements”
          and in harmony with that used by the more advanced healing arts,
          renowned author Stephen Arroyo here explores how astrology as a
          language of energy can be astoundingly accurate and useful in
          illuminating individuals’ energy exchange in all close relationships.
          The preface, author’s note, introduction, and early chapters of
          <i>Person-to-Person Astrology </i>lay the groundwork for serious
          consideration of astrology as a significant discipline. The following
          chapters detail the influence of the four elements—Fire, Earth, Water,
          Air—on the 12 signs, with a particular emphasis on the rising sign
          (Ascendant). The author shows readers how to experiment by comparing
          birth charts, and explains, through detailed descriptions, people’s
          psychological motivations and needs based on the positions of their
          Moon, Venus, and Mars. Appendices include astrological definitions,
          keywords, and sign tables that allow readers quick access to the
          basics. Written in the author’s trademark clear, accessible style,
          <i>Person-to-Person Astrology </i>presents a new approach to finding
          fulfillment in any kind of relationship.
