          A gemstone-supported healing journey guided by your heart
          <br /><br />• Offers hands-on exercises and meditations with more than
          60 gemstones and minerals, each a specific heart-healing stone
          <br /><br />• Explores the anatomy of the physical heart and its
          spiritual symbolism <br /><br />• Shows how your heart is itself a
          sensory organ and coordinator of your energy field <br /><br />•
          Explains how to fortify your heart with emotional strength, reclaim
          your will, cultivate forgiveness, and nurture romantic relationships
          in a meaningful way <br /><br />The word heart can be used in so many
          different ways. We talk about putting our hearts into our work and
          wearing our hearts on our sleeves. There are people who are
          warmhearted and those willing to heal your heartache. Each of us has
          likely known the pangs of conflict between the head and heart. For all
          the trials and pains of daily living, many people are taught to
          distance themselves from their hearts in order to avoid folly and
          failure. The truth is that only in embracing the language of the heart
          can we truly know who we are and where we are going.
          <br /><br />Focusing on the role of crystals in the journey to
          wholeheartedness, Nicholas Pearson reveals how the heart, as the
          literal and metaphorical center of one’s being, has the power to lead
          us to greater balance, healing, and happiness. He explores the anatomy
          of the physical heart and its spiritual symbolism and shows how its
          four chambers are related to the four elements. Offering hands-on
          exercises and meditations with more than 60 gemstones and minerals,
          each a specific heart-healing stone, the author explains how to build
          a better relationship with the heart as your spiritual center as well
          as how to fortify your heart with emotional strength, reclaim your
          will, and cultivate forgiveness. He shows how your heart is the
          coordinator of your energy field and is itself a sensory organ and
          information processor, working to enact healing on many levels. He
          also looks at the heart chakra and how the higher heart chakra is
          evolving. <br /><br />Providing stone-supported lessons for applying a
          heart-centered approach in daily life, from expressing yourself to
          nurturing romantic relationships in a meaningful way, the author shows
          how the journey to wholeness and wholeheartedness isn’t always easy,
          but it cannot be undertaken without first spending time to hear the
          soft, gentle voice of your heart and embrace the transformational
          force of inner alchemy known as love.

          “<i>Crystal Healing for the Heart</i> by Nicholas Pearson is a marvel.
          Why? Because from the core, empowering information down to the
          practical format of the book, it brings together head and heart, as
          few books ever manage. We could not have a finer guide in this, during
          a time when we desperately need it. Thank you always, Nicholas!”
