            >A comprehensive tour of North American spiritual groups that use
            psychoactive drugs in the search for higher consciousness</b
          ><br /><br />• Explores prominent psychedelic churches and sects in
          depth, including the Native American Church and their peyote rituals,
          the cannabis-sex temple known as the Psychedelic Venus Church, and the
          Church of Naturalism, an LSD-therapy cult that came to a murderous
          end<br /><br />• Presents an encyclopedic survey of dozens of minor
          organizations—many of which have never before been documented in an
          authoritative source<br /><br />• Shares personal interviews and
          anecdotes about the strange, outrageous adventures of religious
          psychonauts, alongside rare photos and illustrations<br /><br />From
          LSD-powered guru Timothy Leary to cannabis sex cults to psychedelic
          outlaw churches, Mike Marinacci presents a comprehensive tour of North
          American religious sects and spiritual groups who use entheogens and
          psychoactive drugs in the search for higher consciousness, mystical
          insight, and spiritual enlightenment. Exploring prominent churches and
          cults in depth, he examines the lives of their colorful leaders, the
          origins of their unorthodox beliefs, the controversial practices of
          their congregants, and their many conflicts with both law enforcement
          and public opinion. He looks at the Native American Church and their
          legal battle over their peyote rituals, the cannabis sex temple known
          as the Psychedelic Venus Church, the murderous end of the LSD-therapy
          cult known as the Church of Naturalism, and several other major groups
          and temples of psychedelic spirituality. He then offers an
          encyclopedic survey of dozens of minor organizations, many of which
          have never before been documented in an authoritative source.
          <br /><br />Sharing personal interviews and anecdotes about the
          strange outrageous adventures of religious psychonauts alongside rare
          photos and illustrations, this extensively researched study of
          underground psychedelic religious sects in the United States reveals
          their spiritual and cultural influence from the 1960s to the present
          day.

          “This book not only outlines the history and central principles of
          well-known modern entheogenic groups like the Native American Church
          and the Brotherhood of Eternal Love but also pulls from the shadows of
          history all-but-forgotten characters. Marinacci reproduces intriguing
          photos from the past as well as discusses the founding scriptures of
          these far out religions. All future research in this area will owe a
          debt of gratitude to this unique, well-written volume.”
