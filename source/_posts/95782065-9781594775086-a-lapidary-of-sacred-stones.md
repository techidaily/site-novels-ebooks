          A comprehensive dictionary of sacred and magical gem lore that draws
          on the rarest source texts of Antiquity and the Middle Ages <br />
          <br />• Reveals the healing and magical virtues of familiar gemstones,
          such as amethyst, emerald, and diamond, as well as the lore
          surrounding exotic stones such as astrios, a stone celebrated by
          ancient magicians <br />
          <br />• Examines bezoars (stones formed in animals’ bodies) and
          “magnets” that attract materials other than metal <br />
          <br />• Based on ancient Arabic, Greek, Jewish, and European sources,
          ranging from the observations of Pliny the Elder to extremely rare
          texts such as the <i>Picatrix </i>and Damigeron’s
          <i>Virtue of Stones </i> <br />
          <br />Our ancestors believed stones were home to sacred beings of
          power, entities that if properly understood and cultivated could
          provide people protection from ill fortune, envy, and witchcraft;
          grant invisibility and other magical powers; improve memory; and heal
          the sick from a wide variety of diseases. These benefits could be
          obtained by wearing the stone on a ring, bracelet, or pendant; through
          massage treatments with the stone; or by reducing the gem into a
          powder and drinking it mixed with water or wine. <br />
          <br />Drawing from a wealth of ancient Arabic, Greek, Jewish, and
          European sources--from the observations of Pliny the Elder to
          extremely rare texts such as the <i>Picatrix</i> and Damigeron’s
          <i>Virtue of Stones</i>--Claude Lecouteux provides a synthesis of all
          known lore for more than 800 stones. He includes such common examples
          as the emerald, which when engraved with the figure of a harpy holding
          a lamprey in its claws will banish panic and nightmares, and beryl,
          which when appropriately carved can summon water spirits or win its
          owner high renown, as well as more exotic stones such as astrios, a
          stone celebrated by ancient magicians and whose center glows like a
          star. Lecouteux also examines bezoars--stones formed in animals’
          bodies--as well as “magnets” that attract materials other than iron,
          such as gold, flesh, cotton, or scorpions. <br />
          <br />This comprehensive dictionary of sacred and magical gem lore,
          drawn from the rarest sources of Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
          represents a one-of-a-kind resource for gem enthusiasts and magical
          practitioners alike.
