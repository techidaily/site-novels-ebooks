            _____________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />'Deliverance
            is an <b>intriguing</b>, strangely <b>comforting book</b> that

              something - someone - standing on the other side, staring straight

              terrified, rooted to the spot and unable to breathe. </b
            ><br /><br /><br />His name is Jason Bray. He's your quintessential
            vicar: that guy in the long dress and poncho who stands at the front
            of the church and tells you God loves you. He's the person who will
            baptise your children, take your wedding, and conduct your Auntie
            Beryl's funeral.<br /><br />But then he's also the person you will
            call in when Auntie Beryl still keeps appearing on the landing in
            her nightie, or when things go bump and rattle and your shoes start
            moving on their own, or when you think your mother-in-law might be
            possessed.<br /><br />Jason is a deliverance minister, and this is a
            story of oppression and possession, of ghosts, poltergeists and
            other paranormal phenomena, and how to deal with them. He is the
            first Anglican deliverance minister to write a book about this
            ministry for the general reader. A warm, sympathetic and humorous
            character who sees it as his mission to serve the community and help
            families in distress, each true-life adventure is like a detective
            story. At times, it's a case of mental illness. At others, an energy
            or memory that has latched itself onto a place or property.
            Sometimes, he's even encountered fraud!<br /><br />Welcome to his
            world.

        </h4>
        <p>
          My name is the Reverend Dr Jason Bray and I am your quintessential
          Anglican vicar. At St Giles' Parish Church in Wrexham, I chair council
          meetings over cakes, sandwiches and pot after pot of tea (or strong
          black coffee in my case). Imagine me attending more cheese and wine
          parties than most people have had hot dinners and you have the
          picture. There is also my bread and butter job - services,
          christenings, weddings and funerals. The sitcom <i>Rev </i>has my job
          pretty much spot on. Except for one rather large detail: I am a
          deliverance minister, which means I also deal with hauntings, ghosts,
          demonic possession and all things supernatural. I was a consultant on
          ITV's <i>Midwinter of the Spirit</i>
