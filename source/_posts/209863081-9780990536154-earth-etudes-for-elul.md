            The month of Elul is a time for reflection, a time for t'shuvah, of
            turning and re-turning to G!d and to our best selves, in preparation
            for the Days of Awe. It is time for heshbon hanefesh, examining our
            hearts and souls. Elul is the time for us to begin to make atonement
            for the things we wish we had or hadn't done, and to renew
            ourselves, to do all we can to get ourselves to change. Elul is a
            time to turn away from the ways in which we have missed the mark and
            to make restitution as needed. To help you on this journey, you will
            find in this volume a series of reflections for the month of Elul,
            divrei Earth—teachings that connect Earth and Torah. These poems and
            essays are “etudes” that remind us that we cannot disconnect
            ourselves from all that surrounds us and that we are part of an
            intertwined whole. Use this volume to help you expand your own
            reflections about t'shuvah: read a few etudes a day or even select
            by theme. Themes include climate change, community and covenant,
            cycles, nature, gardening, personal behavior, rituals, and turning.
            These reflections, meditations filled with Jewish wisdom, are
            written by rabbis, hazzans, environmentalists, gardeners, activists,
            educators, storytellers, poets, scientists and other spiritual
            leaders, reflecting many points of view and ways of looking at the
            world and the process of t'shuvah. The editor, Rabbi Katy Allen of
            Ma'yan Tikvah―A Wellspring of Hope, is the co-founder and leader of
            the Jewish Climate Action Network (JCAN) and the facilitator of the
            One Earth Collaborative, a program of Open Spirit in Framingham,
            Massachusetts.

          “Earth Etudes for Elul is the perfect companion for all who desire to
          walk the path of t’shuvah during the period leading up to the turning
          of the Jewish year in the fall. It uniquely links timeless Jewish
          wisdom to what we now know to be our generation’s primary concern:
          climate disruption and environmental degradation. These Etudes are
          filled with grace, lyricism, hope, and inspiration. They will enhance
          the experience of all who seek true t’shuvah and will contribute to
          the healing of our beloved Earth.” —Rabbi Jeff Hoffman,
          Rabbi-in-Residence, Academy for Jewish Religion
        </p>
        <p>
          “Like a forest landscape, Earth Etudes for Elul offers a variety of
          views of the Earth as a sacred place: a home to be preserved, a living
          being who deserves our care and t’shuvah, a focus for prayer and
          inspiration. &nbsp;Many spiritual leaders have offered their personal
          reflections, theological conclusions, and activist aspirations
          regarding the natural world, in brief essays that can be used as
          meditations for Elul, the month of returning. &nbsp;In this age of
          human excess, our process of t’shuvah/repentance should surely engage
          the Earth as well as at one another—Earth Etudes for Elul provides a
          needed opportunity to repair our relationship to the planet on which
          we live.” —Rabbi Jill Hammer, Author, The Jewish Book of Days: A
          Companion for All Seasons

          “Jewish contemplations of the Earth. Rather, human contemplations
          through a lens of experience that was/is Jewish.&nbsp; Rather,
          contemplations not of earth herself but of the bond between earth and
          her myriad earthlings, humans and frogs and redwoods and hippopotami,
          honeybees and rivers, icebergs wailing as they melt, coral reefs
          shrieking as they die.&nbsp; Each contemplation is worth an hour’s
          meditation, even a day if you will set aside the time to read it
          quietly – just one -- and then listen to the still silent voice of
          interbreathing Earth.” -- Rabbi Arthur Waskow, author of Godwrestling
          – Round 2 and co-author of The Rest of Creation (an illustrated tale
          of why God needed Shabbat); editor of Torah of the Earth; director of
          The Shalom Center theshalomcenter.org&gt;.&nbsp;
