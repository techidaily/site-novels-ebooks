            What is passion? Where do we find purpose? Why must we suffer? How
            can the horror of loss be healed through the wisdom that all is
            passing?
          </p>
          <p>
            Nondual wisdom is evolutionary: activating, healing, and liberating
            the Western Psyche. The world can no longer ignore the tremendous
            healing effect of consciousness, and the qualities of consciousness,
            and this book is part of the advance of understanding in how this
            works, spiritually, psychologically, and physically. When passion
            awakens, we open a profound sense of purpose, fulfilment, individual
            manifestation, and evolutionary service to the whole. Passion is a
            path-breaker, resting on the wisdom that everything passes.
          </p>
          <p>Now is the time to open the nondual adventure.</p>
          <p>
            In this book, you'll journey into the quality of passion unveiling
            purpose, direction, choice, happiness, and fulfillment.
          </p>
          <p>You'll learn how to:</p>
          ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Find purpose at the core of
          suffering.·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear passages
          through densities of
          boredom.·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recenter from
          addiction and emotional
          bypass.&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heal and
          resource the body, mind, and
          spirit.·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rise into compassion
          and wisdom.
          <p>
            International spiritual teacher and pioneer of Nondual Therapy
            Georgi Y. Johnson leads you on an experiential investigation into
            the mysteries of passion, purpose. life direction and personal
            fulfillment. Passion is a primal quality of consciousness,
            energizing, rejuvenating, path-breaking, and bringing a flow of
            unconditional fulfillment. You will learn how the free flow of
            passion can heal us, psychologically, spiritually, and physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any exploration of passion is an exploration of consciousness and
            the nature of experience. In this, Nondual Passion will also take
            you into a journey of insight into the nature of suffering. This
            includes a tracing of the flow from suffering, to service, to
            passion, compassion, and wisdom. This energetic passage through the
            psyche is evolutionary, accelerating process of healing, resilience,
            and spiritual liberation. Resting on the nondual wisdom of unity and
            interdependence, the book shows how the passing of time, and the
            passage through space is all part of the passion which is at the
            creative core of all experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The doorway, the book proposes is through the resonance of
            experience. For example, for as long as we identify our purpose as a
            "thing", positioned in the future, that can be won or lost, we will
            never find it. Rather, our purpose is a felt sense - the felt sense
            of purpose - that is a navigational flashlight of consciousness that
            lights up the direction which is attuned to the deepest need and
            facilitates the flow of passion. Page after page, Nondual Passion
            invites you on this experiential journey.

          "Georgi is one of those inspirational teachers and writers who is
          taking the exploration of the healing power of consciousness to a
          whole new level. I have the sense that Nondual Therapy and her
          teachings on true nature are going to change the way we experience,
          and how we relate to our health, to each other, and to the world."
