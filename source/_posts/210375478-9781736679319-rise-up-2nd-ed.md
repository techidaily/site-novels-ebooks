            This mind-expanding, spiritually inspiring journey into the heart of
            creation will elevate and expand your awareness as a
            multi-dimensional being.&nbsp;Through the daily revelations,
            powerful initiations, energetic activations, and audio and video
            downloads available to enhance your experience, this 10-day
            immersion program awakens a life-changing awareness of the Oneness
            of all life that deepens your connection to your own divine nature
            and the world around you.&nbsp;In this second book of the Up!
            trilogy, Suzanne Ross takes you on a virtual journey to witness the
            unfolding of creation from the first thought in infinity to the
            expansion of eternity.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            You will learn how you can experience yourself as a hologram of your
            eternal soul that has been fragmented into many time and space
            dimensions.&nbsp;Through this powerful journey of revolutionary
            insight and wisdom, you are gifted with the tools to reunite all of
            your soul aspects and embrace your highest potential and fullest
            expression of who you are as both physical manifestation and an
            eternal being.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the way, you will discover how the fundamental patterns of
            creation are mastered by mind and how the power of
            Creator-consciousness brings matter into form through sound,
            visualization, and pure intention.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            During this 10-day excursion, you are invited to embark on a virtual
            adventure into the ancient past of our Mayan and Egyptian
            ancestors.&nbsp;The guided tours take you to magnificent monuments
            left behind by our ancestors and explore ancient beliefs that reveal
            the true nature of our connection to celestial beings.&nbsp;This
            deeper understanding of our ancestral past holds clues and answers
            to the timeless questions of who we really are and why we are
            here.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In awakening to who we are as eternal divine beings existing through
            immeasurable millennia, we can experience the knowing, being, and
            expansion of our true nature within.&nbsp;From this deeper place of
            knowing, it also becomes clear that love is the most powerful force
            in all of creation. It's what created us. It's what unites us, and
            it is what reunites us with the divine source of our very existence.
          </p>

            The unique multi-media experience of Rise Up! includes links to the
            author's interviews with thought leaders introduced in the book as
            well guided daily practices to expand your awareness.&nbsp;If you
            are ready to be all that you can be and live a life of pure joy and
            expanded awareness, then dive into this expansive adventure with an
            open mind, and tune into the heart of creation.

          "Rise Up! is the most brilliant and accessible synthesis of esoteric
          wisdom, cycles of time, and cosmic dimensions that I have ever read.
          With expert guidance, Suzanne Ross takes you into the higher planes
          over a ten-day course of instruction. As a totally grounded journey
          into the center of the Universe, this timely self-help manual is a
          wonderful sequel to her emotional processing book, Wake Up! This is a
          must-read for any seeker of wisdom. You will see there is nothing to
          fear as we move rapidly into the Age of Aquarius and remember our
          divine source."

          full potential. For understanding the mystery that is&nbsp;you, pick

          "Rise Up! by Suzanne Ross approaches the constructs of spirituality
          and cosmology from perspectives that are in many ways the opposite of
          my own. Despite that, time and again we arrive at essentially the same
          destination in terms of which elements are key to an ancient tradition
          and their significance. I find quite a lot to recommend in her book."
