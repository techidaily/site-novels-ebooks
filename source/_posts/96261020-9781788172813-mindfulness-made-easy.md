            >An introductory book on mindfulness that will help you to
            understand this popular technique and cultivate a daily practice.</b
          ><br /><br />Mindfulness is a powerful antidote to the stresses of
          modern life and teaches us how to be still in the present moment, to
          pay attention to ourselves and our surroundings and cultivate peaceful
          clarity and openness. <br /><br />Ed Halliwell teaches mindfulness to
          prestigious global organizations, advises the UK government on
          creating mindfulness-based policies and works on mindfulness campaigns
          for the Mental Health Foundation. In this week-by-week guide, packed
          with practical exercises and suitable for all levels of experience, Ed
          presents traditional mindfulness teaching alongside scientific
          evidence that shows these techniques have huge potential for enhancing
          our health and wellbeing.<br /><br />Explore:<br />- key mindfulness
          practices<br />- the science of mindful attention and
          neuroplasticity<br />- how to cultivate a mindful attitude<br />-
          seeing with awareness and approaching challenges<br />- when to let go
          and when to take mindful action<br /><br />This book was previously
          published under the title Mindfulness (Hay House Basics series).

          'This is an inspiring book. Ed Halliwell shows how an ancient wisdom,
          carefully tested by the best methods of modern clinical science, can
          become a trusted resource for the 21st century.'&nbsp;<br /><b

            Guide&nbsp;to&nbsp;Finding&nbsp;Peace&nbsp;in a Frantic World</i
          ><br /><br />'Mindfulness involves an honest and courageous openness
          to the experience of being human in the present moment. Ed Halliwell
          knows the theory and practice of this curiously unfamiliar terrain
          inside out. The result is a practical and helpful guidebook,
          charmingly punctuated with luminous psychological and philosophical
          insight.'&nbsp;<br /><b>- Dr Jonathan&nbsp;Rowson</b>, director, RSA
          Social&nbsp;Brain&nbsp;Centre<br /><br />'Want to discover how to be
          peaceful? Ed has given us pragmatic, clear and compassionate guidance
          that we can apply in our everyday life. The practical guidance on
          mindfulness is interwoven throughout with reference to the scientific
          underpinning, and is brought to life by following the experiences of
          four people who’ve journeyed through the programme.'<br /><b

          >, director, Centre&nbsp;for&nbsp;Mindfulness
          Research&nbsp;and&nbsp;Practice, Bangor&nbsp;University<br /><br />'This
          wonderfully accessible guide to mindfulness is written with a clarity,
          openness and gentle kindness that are some of the hallmarks of
          mindfulness practice itself. Drawing on many of the key elements of
          the MBSR/MBCT course, the book also offers an introductory bridge into
          the rich philosophical foundations that underpin and complete
          mindfulness-based approaches.'<br /><b>- Robert Marx</b>,

          mindfulness&nbsp;training&nbsp;and governance,
          sussex&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;NHS foundation trust<br /><br />'The key
          to lasting happiness is the ability to live in wise relation to our
          thoughts, feelings and surroundings. Mindfulness is a life-changing
          tool that helps us do this and is perhaps the ultimate life skill for
          living well. This book is a fabulous, insightful and accessible
          introduction to mindfulness from one of its leading practitioners.
          Highly recommended.'<br /><b>- Dr Mark Williamson</b>,
          director&nbsp;of&nbsp;Action&nbsp;for&nbsp;Happiness<br />&nbsp;<br />'There's
          little doubt that mindfulness is one of the most powerful remedies for
          the stresses of life in our distracted, hyper-busy, individualistic
          era. But it's surprisingly hard to find truly practical,
          research-backed advice on how to do it. Ed Halliwell's Mindfulness is
          an unprecedentedly clear guide to the topic, cutting through the myths
          and magical thinking to the essence of this ancient yet urgently
          relevant practice. To learn the art of living well and happily by
          paying attention, start by paying attention to this book.'&nbsp;<br /><b

            >Guardian's 'This Column Will Change&nbsp;Your&nbsp;Life</i
          ><br /><br />''With so much being written on mindfulness over recent
          times you could be forgiven for thinking that there is nothing new to
          learn. This book effectively puts paid to that assumption! Ed's
          writing is clear and comprehensible, but it is not just for beginners
          – it is for anyone who wants to be reminded why these ancient
          practices continue to be so relevant to our lives today. By
          interweaving case studies with a week-by-week chapter structure Ed has
          provided a practical, accessible guide which is equally applicable to
          the newcomer or those of us who still struggle to incorporate
          mindfulness practice into our everyday lives.'<br /><b

          practice that has proven – over millennia and across cultures – to be
          an effective tool for managing the stresses of everyday life and for
          cultivating a greater sense of presence and wellbeing. As a gifted and
          valued member of our teaching faculty, Ed Halliwell's Mindfulness
          courses are an essential component of our core curriculum. His latest
          guide offers clear, practical insight and instruction for anyone
