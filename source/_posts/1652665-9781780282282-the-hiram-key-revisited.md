          THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPELLING BOOK EVER WRITTEN ABOUT THE
          SECRET SOCIETY THAT SHAPED THE MODERN WORLD. Freemasonry, with its
          arcane rituals, occult symbols, and labyrinthine hierarchy, has
          mystifi ed the outside world for centuries. But it has become apparent
          that even the most senior Freemasons do not understand its ancient
          origins or purpose. So what is this powerful and arcane organization
          really for? In this eye-opening account, two seasoned researchers show
          that today’s Freemasons are the spiritual descendants of an ancient
          priesthood that was forced to act in secrecy. They predicted the birth
          of the coming Messiah, and Jesus Christ was part of their mission.
          Soon after the Crucifi xion they were nearly wiped out by a program of
          mass genocide conducted by the Romans; later, in feudal Europe, they
          grew to a position of unparalleled power before being branded as
          heretics and forced underground. But they could not be stopped, and
          they continued to work in subtle, sometimes subversive, always
          anonymous, ways to pursue their objective—a new world order that put
          God above, and yet out of, human affairs.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Christopher Knight has written five very successful books. His first
          book, The Hiram Key, co-authored with Robert Lomas, was published in
          1996 and it immediately went into the UK top ten, bestseller list and
          remained there for 8 consecutive weeks. It has since been translated
          into 37 languages and sold over a million copies worldwide, becoming a
          bestseller in several countries. Alan Butler, a qualified engineer,
          but always fascinated by history made himself into something of an
          expert in astrology and astronomy. He has published four successful
          books on the Knights Templar and the Grail legend. He is also a
          published playwright and a very successful radio dramatist. They are
          co-authors of the best selling Civilization One.
