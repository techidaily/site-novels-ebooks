          • Explains how the Yezidis worship Melek Ta’us, the Peacock Angel, an
          enigmatic figure often identified as “the devil” or Satan, yet who has
          been redeemed by God to rule a world of beauty and spiritual
          realization <br /><br />• Examines Yezidi antinomian doctrines of
          opposition, their cosmogony, their magical lore and taboos, the role
          of angels, ritual, and symbology, and how the Yezidi faith relates to
          other occult traditions such as alchemy <br /><br />• Presents the
          first English translation of the poetry of Caliph Yazid ibn Muawiya,
          venerated by the Yezidis as Sultan Ezi <br /><br />The Yezidis are an
          ancient people who live in the mountainous regions on the borders of
          Turkey, Syria, Iraq, and Iran. This secretive culture worships Melek
          Ta’us, the Peacock Angel, an enigmatic figure often identified as “the
          devil” or Satan, hence the sect is known as devil-worshippers and has
          long been persecuted. <br /><br />Presenting a study of the interior,
          esoteric dimensions of Yezidism, Peter Lamborn Wilson examines the
          sect’s antinomian doctrines of opposition, its magical lore and
          taboos, and its relation to other occult traditions such as alchemy.
          He explains how the historical founder of this sect was a Sufi of
          Ummayad descent, Sheik Adi ibn Musafir, who settled in this remote
          region around 1111 AD and found a pre-Islamic sect already settled
          there. Sheik Adi was so influenced by the original sect that he
          departed from orthodox Islam, and by the 15th century the sect was
          known to worship the Peacock Angel, Melek Ta’us, with all its
          “Satanic” connotations. <br /><br />Revealing the spiritual flowering
          that occurs in an oral culture, the author examines Yezidi cosmogony,
          how they are descended from the androgynous Adam--before Eve was
          created--as well as the role of angels, ritual, alchemy, symbology,
          and color in Yezidi religion. He also presents the first English
          translation of the poetry of Caliph Yazid ibn Muawiya, venerated by
          the Yezidis as Sultan Ezi.<br /><br />Showing the Yezidi sect to be a
          syncretic faith of pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian, Christian, Pagan, Sufi,
          and other influences, Wilson reveals how these worshippers of the
          Peacock Angel do indeed worship “the Devil”--but the devil is not
          “evil.” God has redeemed him, and he rules a world of beauty and
          spiritual realization.

          “If as some Yezidis maintain, we are all angels enjoying a temporary
          existence as men and women, we need no rulers, regulations, or
          exoteric religions. In <i>Peacock Angel</i> a lifelong defender of
          anarchism blends poetry, erudition, and spiritual insight to honor
          this misunderstood and persecuted group, perhaps our closest link with
          the primordial tradition itself.”
