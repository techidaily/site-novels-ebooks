          A rebel angel’s revelations on the angelic quarantine after the
          Lucifer Rebellion 203,000 years ago <br />
          <br />• Explores many mythic events in Earth’s ancient history, such
          as visits from the Nephilim and the Pleiadians and the growth and
          destruction of Lemuria <br />
          <br />• Reveals Earth as one of the worlds on which the rebel angels
          have been granted mortal incarnation and the opportunity to redeem
          their past <br />
          <br />• Interwoven with angelic observations about Timothy Wyllie’s
          current and previous lives, such as his long involvement in the still
          controversial Process Church <br />
          <br />After the angelic rebellion 203,000 years ago, Earth and 36
          other planets were quarantined from the larger Multiverse. Despite
          aligning with Lucifer and the rebel angels, Georgia--an angel of
          Seraphic status--was permitted to remain on Earth and continue her
          role as a Watcher. In this book, Georgia, writing together with
          Timothy Wyllie, shares her personal account of half a million years on
          this planet. <br />
          <br />Focusing this volume 38,000 years after the angelic rebellion,
          Georgia shares her experiences being present for key decisions taken
          by the rebel angel leadership, witnessing firsthand Earth’s steady
          descent into darkness, ignorance, and confusion. Georgia explores
          mythic events in Earth’s ancient history, such as visits from the
          Nephilim and the Pleiadians and the destruction of Lemuria, and
          reveals information about angelic influence, their ability to affect
          whales and dolphins, and the presence of illicit alien colonies in
          remote areas of Earth. Interweaving her own story with observations
          about Timothy Wyllie’s current and previous lives, such as his long
          involvement with the Process Church, she explores the supreme
          significance of the Earth as a world on which the rebel angels have
          been accorded the privilege of mortal incarnation and as an arena for
          accelerating spiritual growth. <br />
          <br />Georgia shares her words, in part, to awaken some of the over
          100 million rebel angels currently living out their human lives, most
          unaware of their angelic heritage and struggling with their sense of
          being so different from other people. She shows that a mortal
          incarnation for a rebel angel is an opportunity to personally redeem
          their past and help prepare the way for the imminent transformation of
          global consciousness as the Earth is welcomed back into the
          Multiverse.

          “Timothy has done us all an important favor by sharing his
          well-developed, extensive, and carefully considered personal cosmology
          in his many books. Based in part on the Urantia framework, he has
          taken its concepts and made them relevant and accessible for us all.
          His personal stories illustrate esoteric concepts in remarkable ways.
          The power of the elegant artistry in his words is reflected in the
          memes he has created that have become part of our current culture.
          Timothy Wyllie is an important and underappreciated elder who has much
          to offer anyone who takes the time to read his works.”

        <p>
          Trained as an architect, Timothy Wyllie (1940-2017) was a graphic
          artist and writer who, after a near-death experience in 1973,
          specialized in the study of non-human intelligences, such as angels,
          ETs, and dolphins. He was the author of several books, including
          <i>The Return of the Rebel Angels</i> and
          <i>Awakening of the Watchers</i>.
