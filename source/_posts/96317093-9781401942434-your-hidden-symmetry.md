          On the day you were born, you were imprinted with a plan and a purpose
          – elegant patterns that can be read to see who you really are and what
          your true calling is. And like your own personal map, the design for
          each phase of your life journey was created on the day of your
          birth.<br /><br />Based on ancient Chinese principles of balance and
          health, this book gives you a rich understanding of
          <i>your hidden symmetry</i> – the intricate inner design that
          influences who you are and how your life unfolds. This book is not
          about astrology or numerology; it is grounded in thousands of years of
          research about how time moves in natural patterns that profoundly
          affect you. You can use this knowledge to discover the themes running
          through your life experience, tap into your core strengths, find
          lasting love, and do your best work in the world.<br /><br /><b
            >Jean Haner</b
          >
          shows you how to ride the waves instead of fight the current of your
          life, make the best use of what’s coming in future years, and
          understand why things happened as they did in the past. Jean will
          guide you to discover who you really came here to be, recognize the
          true nature of everyone you meet, and break free of old limitations –
          to create a life of conscious vitality, joy, ease, and love!
