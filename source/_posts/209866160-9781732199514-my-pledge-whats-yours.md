          Everyone should read the book, My Pledge! What’s Yours? When I read
          it, I couldn’t put it down until I completed it because I was
          fascinated by the author’s unique storytelling technique. &nbsp;In
          each chapter, Fyne combines her biography and testimonies into stories
          that motivate and capture your interest so deep you feel connected
          with the event. &nbsp; The real-life experiences shared are so
          captivating, you feel like the neighbor next door who is watching it
          happen. The most interesting aspect of this book is that it
          strengthens my belief that “with God, ALL things are possible.”
          &nbsp;So this is the book you read if you want to feel motivated, to
          feel empowered and to learn about God’s faithfulness!

          captivating, and the wonderful handiwork of God is revealed all
          through the book. The moral lesson should be food for thought to
          all.&nbsp;Man&nbsp;should aspire to positively affect humanity.

          My Pledge! What's Yours? is compelling. It is riveting. Every chapter
          invites you to linger and be enthralled. Even the story of the devil’s
          midnight visit teaches so much, especially how you must realize that
          “God lives inside of us” and ‘God is always on our side and not by our
          side’.&nbsp;Get this book and read it. I assure you, you will not be
          able to put it down.&nbsp;

          My Pledge! What's Yours? shows a detailed account of how a good human
          upbringing can contribute to the molding of one's future. This is one
          book that I couldn't stop reading. I recommend this book to everyone:
          young, old, educators, undergraduates, graduates, school teachers,

          The book, My Pledge! What's Yours? is unique and interesting.<br />Among
          other key points, the author laid emphasis on the importance of
          prayer. I have indeed learned from her to pray whenever I have a
          problem and it is also working for me!&nbsp;
