            >For fans of TLC’s <i>Long Island Medium</i> and anyone interested
            in the big questions of life, death, and finding out what’s
            important in between, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and
            medium Theresa Caputo shares how she discovered her gift and her
            many encounters with Spirit.</b
          ><br /><br />Beloved medium Theresa Caputo, star of the hit television
          show <i>Long Island Medium</i>, opens the door to her world and
          invites you to experience her exceptional gift of communicating with
          those who’ve crossed over to the Other Side. The always funny, frank,
          and down-to-earth medium—whether she’s talking to her family, the
          local butcher, or the souls of those who’ve passed on—began
          communicating with Spirit at the age of four, but didn’t fully accept
          her gift until she was thirty-three years old. She had a good life as
          a busy wife and working mom, but also suffered from chronic anxiety
          that, as it turned out, came from ignoring her abilities. Once Theresa
          began channeling, she realized that she felt much better after
          delivering a message from Spirit and releasing that energy. Since then
          she’ s used her extraordinary gift to help people heal from the loss
          of their loved ones.<br />
          <br />
          Theresa feels that it’s her purpose to make us all aware that there is
          more to life than what we see here in the physical world. She wants
          you to know that your deceased loved ones are safe and at peace, and
          that they’re now with you in a different way—watching over you, loving
          you, and assisting you from the Other Side. She also wants you to
          realize that the unexplainable things you sense and feel from these
          souls are real, and that it’s healthy and essential to acknowledge
          them.<br />
          <br />
          <i>There’s More to Life Than This</i> lends insight on how Theresa’s
          mediumship works, what happens to your soul when you die, what Spirit
          says Heaven is like, what the deceased want you to know, the
          importance of living a positive life, and the many roles that your
          family, friends, angels, guides, souls of faith, and God play here and
          in the afterlife. It also explores how to safely connect with Spirit,
          so that you can recognize when your loved ones are reaching out.<br />
          <br />
          Through Theresa’s personal story, compelling anecdotes, and
          fascinating client readings, she teaches us about how she communicates
          with Spirit and helps us to understand and appreciate the important
          lessons and touching messages that we’re meant to embrace every day.
