          ><br /><br />Mary Anne Radmacher is among the most-quoted women
          writers of our day. Her wisdom is found on greeting cards, journals,
          calendars, Instagram and Pinterest, in broadcast news, sermons,
          ceremonies and commencement speeches.<br /><br />This noted author,
          artist and teacher lost a dear one. As memorial to her friend her book
          became the manifesto for an intentional life for thousands of people.
          In <i>Live with Intention</i>, Radmacher shares the story of how she
          learned to live more robustly by watching how her courageous friend
          chose to die. People who keep Radmacher’s writings at the ready, say
          this writing is both inspiring and comforting. Extraordinary lessons
          are drawn from ordinary experiences. Rich in story, metaphor and
          poetry, <i>Live with Intention</i> explores with you what it means to
          live each day with purposeful intent:Understand what matters most for
          youDeepen what already makes your life richDetermine your unique way
          to make a difference<br /><br /><b

          “Mary Anne Radmacher has written a book of beauty, creativity, wisdom,
          and great good will. Her chapter on forgiveness alone is worth the
          price of the book.” —Hugo Prather, author of&nbsp;Morning

          “A book of heaven for our small days.” —Ruth Forman, author
          of&nbsp;Prayers Like Shoes
        </p>
        <p>
          “Mary Anne Radmacher always inspires! This revision continues to offer
          practical advice, rooted in experience, now augmented by personal
          stories that add even more depth of perspective. You could consider
          this a Six Sigma guide to personal intention, minus the fancy
          statistics. With every reading, I glean important nuggets of ways to
          hone my own best practices. She insists that everyone is their own
          expert and exudes positivity in helping you find your own encouraging
          voice. Don’t miss the nugget of this book—Em graciously includes her
          finely honed process for determining your own intentions and living up
          to them. In this, she is a shining beacon of hope for universal growth
          through sharing ideas. I highly recommend this read—like a
          heart-shaped rock, it is a rare find.” —Dr. Susan Paul Johnson

          Florida Institute, and treasurer of the International Expressive Arts

          “Anyone who has ever met Mary Anne Radmacher knows that there are
          countless things to love and admire about her. She’s a beautiful human
          being who gives generously from her heart and who genuinely lives
          everything she teaches. She’s also absolutely delightful, with a
          childlike wonder that is infectious. (Think polka dots!) But in this
          moment, what I want to appreciate most about Mary Anne is her
          self-proclaimed devotion to being a poet and aphorist. In&nbsp;Live
          with Intention&nbsp;Mary Anne has given us another big, juicy basket
          filled with delectable (and easily digestible) truth fruits. Open the
          book anywhere and you will be gifted with yummy wisdom from Mary Anne
          and friends. There’s lot to enjoy right now—and plenty to put in your
          pockets when you’re hungry for more later! Set an intention right now
          to live the joyful practices gifted to you in this book!” —Sherry

          lessons.&nbsp;Live with Intention&nbsp;captures it all. Mary Anne
          specializes in packing vital concepts into brief, memorable aphorisms.
          These profound, life-changing nuggets of wisdom, along with personal
          stories and those of friends guarantee to enrich your
          experience.&nbsp;Live with Intention&nbsp;is an interactive book. Grab
          a pen, a highlighter, and something for taking notes, or scribble in
          the margins. I filled an entire page within the first half-hour. Read
          them aloud to solidify them in your soul. If you long to live a life
          that matters,&nbsp;Live with Intention&nbsp;is your must-have field
          guide. Use the enclosed prompts from her class, Remember and Do What
          Matters, to clarify your own intentions.&nbsp;Live with

          “I am beyond pleased that Mary Anne Radmacher and Conari Press are
          issuing this tenth anniversary, revised edition of&nbsp;Live with
          Intention, a book that will put you in touch with your deepest self, a
          practice that will change you and the world around you. This is a fine
          book with a high purpose, nothing less than inspiring each of us to be
          our best selves. I highly recommend it.” —Jan Johnson, former

          “Mary Anne Em Radmacher has done it again. Full of heartfelt
          knowing,&nbsp;Live with Intention&nbsp;will change your life if you
          listen deeply and put the lessons in it to work. Her words soothe the
          soul, create space for us to love ourselves and others, and offer
          concrete tools for discovering and living our intentions with grace,
          self-care, and spirit. This ‘revision’ is actually more of a ‘rewrite’
          as she shares new voices, new lessons, and new stories to illuminate
          the underlying premise that we need to remember and do what matters.
          There are lessons for real life, methods to be more intentional, and
          much more soul food in these pages. After reading this book, I feel
          refreshed and equipped to live more intentionally in my everyday life.

          poster of ‘Live with Intention,’ the inspiring phrase by Mary Anne
          Radmacher. It has hung on my wall ever since, in seven different
          houses. I have since bought and read every book she has written. Mary
          Anne's newest book is beautiful, artistic, inspiring, and written from
          her heart.” —Dr. Patrick Williams, master certified coach and coauthor

          “Mary Anne's work saved my life in 2003. After the loss of my mother,
          I was spiraling down and had no focus and no sense of ME. I had no
          idea that on my mom's birthday, which was two months after her death,
          that I would receive my first sense of healing through Mary Anne's
          verse ‘We Laught to Survive.’ My mom was speaking to me, Mary Anne was
          speaking to me, and after a two hour meltdown in her booth... I was
          speaking to my soul to recover. I have represented Mary Anne's work
          since that day at my business in Charleston, South Carolina, and that
          same event will happen at my booth on almost a daily basis. Her verses
          open those floodgates for grief, fear, and those challenges with
          friends, family, and work. This connection then transfers to me to
          hear their story and I then become a conduit to help them find
          inspiration for themselves or family or friends. It has been an honor
          to handle Mary Anne's work and help so many people find confidence,
          courage and a sense of purpose in their journey in life.” —Owners of
          JOYCE’s CHOICES

        <p>
          “If I could have only one poem for the rest of my life, ‘Live with
          Intention’ would be my choice. This verse has been my True North for
          decades, a reminder to give myself over to what really matters. The
          pages of this book are beautifully filled with wisdom, love, grace,
          and inspiration. And a healthy dose of truth-telling. Mary Anne walks
          the path with her readers, leading alongside. Journeying with her and
          this book is a wise, wise choice and a precious gift to yourself.”
