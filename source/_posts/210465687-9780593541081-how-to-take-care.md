          ><br /><br />Healing is not just for people who have their s&amp;*t
          together. Healing is, most important, for people who are falling
          apart. <i>How to Take Care </i>will help you learn to trust your
          instincts, listen to your body, and practice small, easy steps to
          soothe anxiety, burnout, and symptoms of PTSD.<br /><br />From A
          (adaptogenic herbs, ancestral healing) to Z (zoetic),
          <i>How to Take Care</i> is for anyone striving to live slowly, with
          self-compassion, one moment at a time. Learn tangible steps to dispel
          shame, tell the truth, and loosen the grip on whatever is holding you
          back. Sample guided meditations, cook nurturing recipes, and follow
          handy how-tos. Practice the grounding of a clean sink when you’d
          rather burn the house down, or connect with nature by growing flowers
          from seed. Keep this guide on your nightstand or in your backpack for
          easy-reference tools, techniques, and strategies to calm your nervous
          system and come back to your body. It is a gift for yourself or anyone
          else who is going through a big, messy, or trying season of life.

          “A healing book for the world weary and traumatized, the over-burdened
          &amp; under-mothered. This elegantly illustrated and inspired
          collaboration has a cure on every page. Hilarious and brave, tender
          and wise. Buy this book for yourself, and anybody else who needs a
          dang break.”—<b>Mary Karr</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author of <i>The</i> <i>Liars’ Club</i>, <i>Cherry</i>, <i>Lit</i>,
          and<i> Art of Memoir</i><b><br /></b><br />"Entering the world of this
          book—and it truly feels like a <i>world,</i> lushly illustrated,
          radiating tenderness and honesty—feels like sitting by a window and
          talking with a bighearted friend who also happens to be funny as f-ck,
          and eating hot fudge sundaes while a rainstorm rages outside. The sky
          is dark, and the flood might be coming, but the air is bristling with
          candor and compassion, just like these pages, which are full of
          hard-won insights attuned to the body, alive to the soul, and always
          aware of their entwinement. Something in this book will crack open a
          window in your life, I promise you—to let in the smell of the rain,
          the cold moonlight, the snow under streetlamps, the dawn."—<b
            >Leslie Jamison</b
          >, author of <i>The Empathy Exams<br /></i><br />"With warmth and
          compassion, Williams and Novotny have created a reassuring, loving,
          and essential guide to taking care. If, like me, you are sure you were
          absent the day they handed out the life manuals, it’s here now. You
          will love this book, but even better, this book will love you
          back."—<b>Elizabeth Crane</b>, author of <i>This Story Will Change</i
          ><br /><br />"<i>How to Take Care</i> has the feeling of cracking open
          a wise auntie's grimoire in that it is both referential and
          ancestral—a collection of hard-earned knowings, lovingly compiled. My
          heart beams thinking of this timeless book being passed down from hand
          to hand, kitchen to kitchen, generation to generation."—<b

            >Tarot for Pregnancy: A Companion for Radical Magical Birthing
            Folks</i
          ><br /><br />"<i>How to Take Care</i> feels like a comfortable cup of
          tea with your wise but hilarious friends. These warm, bite-size
          offerings of healing make doable that ever illusive idea of self-care.
          They deftly&nbsp;weave personal experience, clinical expertise, and
          curiosity, providing us with hopeful resources to honor the past and
          move confidently into our futures."—<b>Rebecca Feldman</b>, midwife,
