          The true nature of your being, is the Gift, from within your good
          soul, your good spirit, connecting with your good thoughts. You will

          everything.

            be made to manifest and come true. Know that the connecting powers
            are within you. All things are possible when you see with the inner
            vision.

          <p>
            The belief of knowing all is true awaits the eyes that see. It
            teaches that while physically being bound to earth, there is within

          From our Ancient Past; certain words in phrases were written in code,
          we say and use these phrases without knowing the true meaning behind
          them:You Will "find out"When You "open up your gift"It Came To You
          "just out of the blue"You Were "walking tall, with your head up in the
          sky"You Said "it's right on the money""Remember what comes to you in
          the Whispering Words of Wisdom; you will hear the answers. It is then
          to recognize the opportunities that become present"
