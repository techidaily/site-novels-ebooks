            Cheiro acquired his expertise in India. As a teenager, he traveled
            to the Bombay port of Apollo Bunder. There, he met his Guru, an
            Indian Brahmin, who took him to his village in the valley of the
            Konkan region of Maharashtra. Later Cheiro was permitted by Brahmans
            to study an ancient book that has many studies on hands; the pages
            of the book were made of human skin and written with gold and it is
            still guarded and protected with great care. After studying
            thoroughly for two years, he returned to London and started his
            career as a palmist. Cheiro had a wide following of famous European
            and American clients during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
            He read palms and told the fortunes of famous celebrities like Mark
            Twain, W. T. Stead, Sarah Bernhardt, Mata Hari, Oscar Wilde, Grover
            Cleveland, Thomas Edison, the Prince of Wales, General Kitchener,
            William Ewart Gladstone, and Joseph Chamberlain. He documented his
            sittings with these clients by asking them to sign a guest book he
            kept for the purpose, in which he encouraged them to comment on
            their experiences as subjects of his character analyses and
            predictions. Of the Prince of Wales, he wrote that "I would not be
            surprised if he did not give up everything, including his right to
            be crowned, for the woman he loved." Cheiro also predicted that the
            Jews would return to Palestine and the country would again be called
            Israel. In his own autobiographical book, Cheiro's Memoirs: The
            Reminiscences of a Society Palmist, he included accounts of his
            interviews with King Edward VII, William Gladstone, Charles Stewart
            Parnell, Henry Morton Stanley, Sarah Bernhardt, Oscar Wilde,
            Professor Max Muller, Blanche Roosevelt, the Comte de Paris, Joseph
            Chamberlain, Lord Russell of Killowen, Robert Ingersoll, Ella
            Wheeler Wilcox, Lillie Langtry, W. T. Stead, Richard Croker, Natalia
            Janotha, and other prominent people of his era.&nbsp;
