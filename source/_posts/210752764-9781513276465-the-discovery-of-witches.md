          <p>
            Starting in the 15th century, a fear of witchcraft and alternative
            practices grew into a hysteria. Because witches were suspected to be
            devil worshippers, they were considered heretics to the Christian
            church. Consequently, the Christians launched a crusade against
            these women and men. Matthew Hopkins was not only among the greatest
            supporters of this crusade, but also one of the most active
            participants. In just over a year, Matthew Hopkins, a
            self-proclaimed “Witchfinder General”, killed over one hundred
            people. While the witch hunt hysteria infected much of the 17th
            century society in England, there were still those who opposed the
            accusations and discrimination against witches. After being
            criticized for his work, Hopkins decided to publish a guide to witch
            hunting, including methods to discover a witch, how to torture them
            into a confession, and how to prosecute them. Along with outlines of
            torture methods, such as sleep deprivation and forced physical
            activity, <i>The Discovery of Witches</i> also addressed the
            questions and concerns raised by those who did not support Hopkins.
            Under the guise of being a man of God, Hopkins claimed to have been
            sent on a divine mission to manipulate other religious groups into
            joining his cause. As Hopkin’s practices brought him lucrative
            success, he rose to a short-lived power, but his published doctrine
            spread his influence for years after his death.

            <i>The Discovery of Witches</i> by Matthew Hopkins is a short text
            of immeasurable insight. Though now recognized as zealot propaganda,
            <i>The Discovery of Witches</i> depicts a chilling perspective of a
            heinous time in history, including the concerns of those who opposed
            it. While Hopkin’s work immortalizes a fascinating yet repulsive
            historical movement, it also invites readers to reflect on the ways
            the spirit of his manipulation is still present in modern society.
