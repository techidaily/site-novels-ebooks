            meditation for the whole family—featuring targeted practices for
            parents, teens, and kids of all ages.</b
          ><br /><br />
          As a certified yoga teacher, meditation teacher, and host of the
          chart-topping podcast <i>Mindful in Minutes</i>, Kelly Smith is no
          stranger to the<b> wide-ranging health benefits of meditation</b>. And
          she discovered she needed them more than ever when she became a mom
          for the first time. Suddenly finding herself coping with sleepless
          nights, disheartening physical changes, uncontrollable worries, and
          near constant sensory overload, Kelly found solace in the same thing
          she always had: her daily meditation practice. In doing so, she
          discovered how meditation could
          <b
            >help not only moms cope with common family challenges, but every
            other member of the family as well</b
          >.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Kelly shares her hard-won wisdom with listeners across the country in
          her second podcast <i>Meditation Mama</i>, and now, in this fully
          illustrated book.
          <i>Mindful in Minutes: Meditation for the Modern Family</i> helps
          families of all kinds
          <b
            >learn how to use meditation to cope with the everyday struggles of
            being a person who is also part of a family</b
          >. Covering topics ranging from quieting the mind and managing stress
          to handling resentment and cultivating compassion, this book offers
          specialized practices for each family member by age—adults, teens and
          older kids, and small children. Topics include:<br />
          &nbsp; Being Present Finding Joy Anxiety Hyperactivity Worthiness
          Empathy Burnout Insomnia Self-Confidence Overstimulation Connecting
          with the True Self And much more <br />
          With <b>three distinct, age-appropriate practices for each topic</b>,
          Kelly ensures that every member of the family has access to a
          practical, focused meditation “toolkit” to draw on when they need a
          little extra help. The book also includes a series of dedicated
          meditations for expectant parents, a series of meditations to promote
          a healthy, loving relationship between partners, and
          <b>over 250 mantras</b> to help you focus your mind and go deeper into
          your practice.<br /><br />
          Whether you are a meditation beginner or a long-term practitioner,
          this book will help you and your family feel calmer, happier, and more
          connected.
