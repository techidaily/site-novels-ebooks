          <p>
            In the wee hours of a bitter winter night, Harriet, a respectable,
            middle-aged chiropractor, falls through the ice of a frozen lake.
            She was alone; she should have died. Instead she returns to
            consciousness standing on a ridge above the lake at sunrise, singing
            with other voices a haunting, exquisitely beautiful Song. But no one
            else is there, and there are no footprints in the snow, not even
            hers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Returning home, she discovers that when she touches someone who is
            ill or in pain, the same strange Song arises, allowing her to see
            into the body and heal all that is amiss.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is confounded by the mystery of her rescue and the source of the
            Song. Voices and visions speak to her in dreams, tantalizing her,
            but all meaning is lost in the waking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she rejoices in the ability to resolve her patients’ pain,
            she is daunted by the power in her hands, feeling inadequate to
            handle it wisely. Questions arise about if and when it is
            appropriate to intervene with such miraculous potency in the life—or
            death—of another. And she is soon inundated with more patients than
            she can possibly accommodate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overwhelmed, she flees to her small rural hometown. When she learns
            that the married chiropractor who was her lover and mentor long ago,
            and whom she still deeply loves, is now widowed and dying of cancer,
            Harriet’s search for answers takes on a poignant and personal
            urgency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Song of Eliria is a mystery, a love story, and a profound
            exploration into the essence and ethics of healing.
