            ><br />Readers will learn to recognize their inner darkness and

            turning these shadows into superpowers. Journaling spaces and
            exercises will help readers live Michelle’s lessons, and the book
            closes with a set of ongoing practices to allow readers to carry the
            book’s wisdom through the rest of their lives.<br /><br />Based on
            her own experiences with early childhood trauma,
            <i>Shadow Work</i> is the culmination of Michelle's hard-earned
            knowledge of self-love and forgiveness to achieve a life filled with
            creativity, love, and abundance. For anyone ready to explore and
            embrace the darkest parts of themselves, <i>Shadow Work </i>offers
            an easy-to-follow path to transcendence, self-compassion, and
            healing.

          reading <i>Shadow Work</i>, I felt like I was on a conveyor belt
          leading into <b>REAL healing</b>, the rewiring of my brain, and
          freedom. You may find yourself <i>excited</i> to discover difficult
          parts of yourself that have held you back. For anyone who is ready to
          take charge of their lives, love themselves like crazy, be free of
          trauma, and open the door to all their possibilities,

            >Michelle Wadleigh is a powerful guide, and this book is the
            ticket</b

          author of <i>Thriving Through Uncertainty</i> and
          <i>A Year Without Fear<br /></i><br />"In this <b>revelatory</b> book,

          traveling into our inner darkness with compassion so that we may claim
          the healing and self-love that lies within." —HeatherAsh Amara,
          bestselling author, Warrior Goddess series<br /><br />“Shadow work was
          a key to unlocking the unconscious blocks that were keeping me in so
          much pain. And Michelle's book is
          <b
            >stellar in not only explaining what it is but also how to do it in
            a friendly and effective way</b
          >. If you are struggling with moving forward or becoming free in any
          area of your life, I'm confident there is some shadow there that is
          calling you to greater healing. T<b
            >his book will not only get you to the shadow - but it will also get
            you through it and help you incorporate it so you become the master
            of your inner world instead of afraid of it.</b
          >
          All praise to Rev. Michelle for this <b>transformational work</b>.”
          —Mark Anthony Lord, spiritual leader and author<br /><br />“With deep
          love and a gentle touch,
          <b
            >Michelle Wadleigh brings to light that which we most want to keep
            in the shadows and walks us out of the darkness so that we can
            experience the joy we deserve</b
          >. Thank you for the gift of this book.” —Rev. Dr. Michele
          Whittington, founder of Unleash Your Life and author<br /><br />“You,
          like me, stand to get the most from this book if you have spent a
          lifetime hiding from and overcompensating for those aspects of
          yourself that you’ve considered ugly, undesirable, and therefore
          unacceptable. With every chapter, I discovered how self-rejecting I’ve
          been and why.
          <b
            >By the final page, I was never so glad to be wrong about who I
            thought I was.</b
          >
          I recommend this book with a caution: you, too, may come away feeling
          dead wrong about who you feared you were and who you deplored you
          weren’t.” —Catherine A. Duca<b>, </b>LCSW and author<br /><br />“Michelle
          Wadleigh takes your hand and walks you through in a step- by-step
          process to eliminate blocks, some you didn’t even know you had, to
          <b>open your life to joy</b>.” —Rev. Dr. Wendy Purcell
