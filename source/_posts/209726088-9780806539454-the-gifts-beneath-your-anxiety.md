            >In these uncertain times, those who already suffer from anxiety are
            struggling more than most. But what if you could harness the power
            that lurked beneath your anxiety? Renowned spiritual healer and
            expert Pat Longo demonstrates the ways in which exploring the roots
            of our anxiety can help us discover the path toward healing and
            inner peace. &nbsp;</b

            >You just might be an empath. And a few simple tools could change
            your life &nbsp;</b
          ><br /><b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          As a spiritual healer and teacher to some of today’s most well-known
          empaths—including “Long Island Medium” Theresa Caputo—Pat Longo has
          found that many of the individuals who have come to her with anxiety
          and related symptoms possess a heightened sense of perception and an
          extreme level of intuition—absorbing the energies, thoughts, and
          feelings that surround them and even experiencing them as their own.
          What’s more, most of these individuals had no idea that they possess
          the abilities of an empath.<br /><b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          In Pat’s experience, just beneath what feels distressing can be
          something wonderful. In this illuminating book, Pat guides you to
          become aware of, care for, and protect your spiritual self and energy;
          discover, develop, and strengthen the powerful gifts within; and in
          doing so, to eliminate and prevent related anxiety and other
          symptoms.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Using simple exercises utilized in her own practice, plus instructive
          and inspiring case studies, Pat will show you how to:<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          *Understand what an empath really is and determine whether you are
          one<br />
          *Learn simple spiritual healing steps to care for your whole
          self—physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual<br />
          *Connect to your inner spiritual self and the power within<br />
          *Protect and ground yourself spiritually and energetically<br />
          *Forgive and let go of past hurts<br />
          *Raise your energetic vibration<br />
          *Become aware of and develop your intuitive abilities with focused
          activities such as meditations, visualizations, automatic writing,
          psychometry, and other exercises<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In an increasingly anxious world, getting in touch with our deepest
          healing abilities and achieving inner peace is more important than
          ever. With this invaluable book as your tool kit, you begin your
          journey toward finding that peace, becoming aware of and caring for
          your spiritual self and gifts, and healing your life.
