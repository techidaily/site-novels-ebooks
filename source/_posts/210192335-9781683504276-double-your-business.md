          Some people would say starting their own business from scratch and
          building it up to a comfortable income is the hardest part. However,
          many realize that doubling their business is the bigger task and often
          wonder how they can accomplish this while still enjoying their life.
          After all, there are only 24 hours in a day!
          <p>
            When business owners already feel too busy to find and serve more
            clients, it can seem impossible to double their business without
            duplicating themselves. Even after coming up with numerous options,
            and getting opinions from others, sometimes nothing seems to feel
            good because every solution requires more of their time and energy
            that is currently at a premium. In <i>Double Your Business</i>,
            business professionals alike will find the path to doubling their
            business without giving up everything else they desire.

        <p>
          Cassie Parks loves the ocean, dancing for no reason, and celebrating
          with champagne, but what she loves most of all is living a life she
          loves. She is a bestselling author, international speaker, and coach
          whose passion is leading others to live the life they have been
          dreaming about. Cassie retired at 32 by combining her love for real
          estate and the Law of Attraction to create financial independence. She
          believes you can create anything you desire, even that dream you've
          been too afraid to admit to having. Cassie is the host of the popular
          Manifest it Now podcast and the creator of the Manifest 10K course,
          which has helped hundreds of people develop better relationships with
          money and manifest more money into their lives. Her one-of-a-kind
          Enchanted Future workshop allows people to discover that they can be
          their own magic wand and create a life full of dreams come true. When
          Cassie isn't writing, speaking, or coaching you can find her traveling
          the world, sitting on her Denver balcony soaking up the mountain view,
          or enjoying the company of her friends and family. Cassie's life motto
          is: You are worthy of living the best story you can tell.
