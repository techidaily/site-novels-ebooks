            Quareia the Apprentice is the first of three sections of the Quareia
            magical training. The course is spread over three sections:
            Apprentice, Initiate, and Adept. The Apprentice section has ten
            modules, and each module has eight lessons. The Apprentice section
            is approximately five hundred thousand words: it is the most
            extensive, in-depth, and intelligent up to date magical course that
            is currently available worldwide.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Subject matter covered in the Apprentice section includes Core
            Skills, Patterns and Maps in Magic, The Power Dynamics of Creation,
            Death, Birth and the Underworld, Magical Tools, Different Types of
            Beings, Elements as Tools, The Inner Temples, Working with Planetary
            Powers, and Understanding Destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methods, information and techniques in the course enable the
            magician to engage any form of magic and work with it appropriately
            with the full knowledge of how that magic works, why it works and
            what is behind it. The course work, which is both theory and
            practice, is not reference material or 'recipe magic' that can be
            dipped in and out of: the understanding of the foundations comes
            from the dovetailing, study, and layering of magic that forms within
            and around the apprentice. It is designed to be self-taught, with
            every detail and step assigned carefully and practically. By the end
            of this section, the apprentice will have all of the skills,
            knowledge and strength to take on the challenge of the next stage of
            training. Visit the Quareia website for more information at
