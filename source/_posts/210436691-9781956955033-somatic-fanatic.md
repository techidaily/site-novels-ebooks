          <p>
            By age 40, Dan Sykes seemed to have all the cash and prizes most men
            want-the beautiful wife, the happy kids, the thriving
            business-without ever surrendering to a mundane life. That is, until
            everything unraveled.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            After a difficult divorce, Sykes felt old, heavy and not thrilled to
            embark on bachelor life with a gut-all while his ex-wife raised
            their three kids next door in their small Maine town. Feeling
            mentally, physically and emotionally broken, Sykes set out to change
            his life by finding out who he really was.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            After Sykes went to a seminar in Paris, he stumbled into the world
            of Systema. During a an intense training session (with a grown man
            shoving wooden sticks into his back), Sykes had an experience that
            changed his life.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            By leaning into his fear of physical pain and intense sensation,
            Sykes saw that Systema's mindful movement and impact were unlocking
            his internal cage of tension-a cage he hadn't known about that had
            been holding him back for decades.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Hungry for more, Sykes traversed the globe to train with masters of
            somatic arts both ancient and modern. In the process, he discovered
            that despite Western fitness and lifestyle stereotypes, anybody can
            become more fit, relaxed and comfortable in their skin-regardless of
            their age or size.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In Somatic Fanatic, Sykes chronicles his 10-year journey of
            self-transformation in pursuit of better living through a
            better-functioning nervous system. His journey shows that a freer
            and richer life is possible for anyone-and that somatic training has
            the potential to revolutionize Western conceptions of health and
            wellness.
