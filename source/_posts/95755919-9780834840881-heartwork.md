            >Nine simple mindfulness practices anyone can use to generate
            compassion--toward oneself, others, and the world--and to live from
            that place of intelligent kindness in the face of life's
            difficulties.</b
          ><br /><br />Compassion is the urge to understand and alleviate the
          suffering of another being. And if that being happens to be
          <i>you</i>, then the technique called self-compassion can be the
          greatest of blessings—for the compassion you learn to apply to
          yourself naturally extends to all the other people in your life. With
          the nine simple mindfulness practices she presents here, Radhule
          Weininger provides a step-by-step course in self-compassion. Using
          stories drawn from her own life and those of others she shows that,
          with the right intention and practice, we can all deepen our capacity
          to respond skillfully to our own suffering and thus to that of others
          and our world.

          “There is no healing without heartwork, intimately tending to the
          wounds we’ve been avoiding for so long.&nbsp;In this powerful and
          beautiful book, Radhule Weininger will help you find the courage,
          pathways, and clarity needed to embrace this life with love.”<br />
          &nbsp;—Tara Brach, PhD,&nbsp;author of
          <i>Radical Acceptance </i>and<i> True Refuge</i>&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In her practice as a psychotherapist and mindfulness meditation
          teacher, Radhule Weininger guides her patients along the path of
          personal transformation through the practice of compassion and
          self-compassion. From the experience of that work comes
          <i>Heartwork</i>, a book that weaves together Weininger’s work and
          personal journey, wisdom teachings and hands-on exercises. Conveyed
          through prose that is accessible to readers from a range of spiritual
          traditions and backgrounds, Weininger presents her insights on the
          methods she has found useful for identifying the roots of the issues
          we are all grappling with, as a first step toward addressing them
          through practice and perseverance. Shining through every chapter is
          the author’s desire to help reduce the suffering that is the common
          thread connecting humanity.”<br />
          —Victor Chan, coauthor of <i>Wisdom of Forgiveness</i> and
          <i>Wisdom of Compassion</i> with His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai
          Lama<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Radhule Weininger offers a tremendous gift in her book,
          <i>Heartwork</i>, which weaves together the beauty of art, the wisdom
          of reflection, and the effectiveness of years of practical clinical
          application. The wealth of ideas and practices presented in this
          illuminating work will be of benefit and will help transform our
          individual and collective lives.”<br />
          —Shauna Shapiro, PhD, professor at Santa Clara University and author
          of <i>The Art and Science of Mindfulness </i>and
          <i>Mindful Discipline</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In its clear, inviting, and practical way, this book can change your
          life.&nbsp;Drawing on her years of combining mindfulness with the
          expansive power of compassion, Radhule Weininger brings us practices
          that serve to free us from fear, despair, self-hate, and other
          oppressive mind-states. Her three-part book begins with the rare,
          poignant journey that led her to these discoveries, and then, after
          their various forms are carefully set forth, concludes with nine
          real-life stories of how different people have put them to
          use.&nbsp;<i>Heartwork</i>&nbsp;helps me to be more present in each
          moment, more mindful of each encounter.&nbsp;I am especially grateful
          for the importance given to intention and motive in shaping what we
          accomplish and whom we become.”<br />
          —Joanna Macy, author of&nbsp;<i>Coming Back to Life&nbsp;</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This book is brimming with compassion! It’s filled with countless
          practical exercises, heartfelt stories, and wise guidance for living
          with an open heart. Radhule beautifully guides us on a journey home to
          ourselves.”<br />
          —Diana Winston, Director of Mindfulness Education at UCLA’s Mindful
          Awareness Research Center and coauthor of
          <i>Fully Present: The Science, Art, and Practice of Mindfulness</i
          >.<br /><br />"This is a lovely book that presents the topics of
          compassion for self and others from a Buddhist perspective. &nbsp;With
          many meditations and journal exercises, this book will help you open
          your heart."—Kristin Neff, Ph.D., author of
          <i>Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself</i>
