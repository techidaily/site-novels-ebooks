          Shares the wisdom of animals and their matching gemstones to help work
          on yourself mentally, emotionally, physically, and spiritually
          <br /><br />• Reveals the energetic connections between 88 different
          animal allies and 88 gems, stones, and crystals from the mineral
          kingdom <br /><br />• Includes animal medicine teachings from a
          variety of creatures, from hummingbirds and cats to dolphins and
          bears, to help you find inner peace, knowledge, and wisdom
          <br /><br />• Explains how the color, formation, and the manner in
          which a stone grows in the Earth offers a teaching to know yourself
          and your life purpose <br /><br />All creatures, great and small, in
          all species on this planet are interconnected. When an animal, insect,
          bird, or other creature from nature appears repetitively, whether in
          real life or dreams, it is time to pay attention and find the message
          that nature is bringing you. There are many teachings available to us
          through the observation of a particular animal totem and their habits
          and patterns. For example, parrot medicine can teach us to see life
          from another perspective as we mimic the wise ones who have walked on
          the path before us. Mouse medicine teaches us to scrutinize all the
          details before taking action. Bear may teach you to go within yourself
          to find answers within your personal cave. Every animal is an ally,
          and every animal has a story to help you find inner peace, knowledge,
          and wisdom. <br /><br />The associated gemstone for each animal totem
          is a further indication of the energy of the animal as symbolism and a
          teaching on your sacred journey. Crystals, minerals, and stones hold
          the history of the Earth and all this planet has to offer you to
          evolve your soul and spirit in this incarnation. The color, formation,
          and the manner in which the stone grows in the Earth offers a teaching
          to know yourself and your life purpose. It takes time and inner
          reflection to understand the messages and clues throughout the
          gemstone kingdom. <br /><br />Matching the teachings of animals with
          the teachings of gemstones, Margaret Ann Lembo shows how there is
          symbolism in all around offering clues to light your path. Exploring
          88 gems, stones, and crystals and 88 different animal allies, she
          details the spiritual connections of crystal vibrations and animal
          medicine, providing you with a deeper understanding of the
          interconnected energies of everything around us. She shows how the
          spiritual fulfillment you seek is available to you in so many ways and
          this path of working with gemstones and animal medicine is just one of
          many.

          “<i>Animal Totems and the Gemstone Kingdom</i> has already earned a
          space on my shelf of favorite books. I’ve long believed in the power
          of animal totems, but only Margaret’s compendium links an animal with
          its unique gemstone, relaying the messages conveyed by both. Magic and
          meaning come together in this one-of-a kind resource, which I’ll be
          using daily. This book is irreplaceable.”
