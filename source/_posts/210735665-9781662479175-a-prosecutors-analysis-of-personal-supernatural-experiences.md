            Throughout history, there have been stories about extraordinary,
            unexplainable, supernatural events. You may have read one of these
            stories, or you may have seen a story on television or heard one
            from a friend or relative. When you heard the story, you probably
            thought it was a fantasy or the person telling it was a fake, a
            fraud, a weirdo, or a phony. If you read the story in the Bible or
            in a book, you may have thought that stories about supernatural
            events do not occur in modern-day society. In this new age of
            science and reason, there is a logical, scientific explanation for
            everything, right? But is it possible that even today, in our modern
            society, there are regular people, who are not psychics or mediums
            or spiritualists, who have had premonitions, sent telepathic
            messages, witnessed healings, seen deceased loved ones, seen spirits
            and ghosts, witnessed objects or paintings inexplicably fall from
            walls just before a critical moment, and experienced other events
            that scientist simply cannot explain?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In this book, Bernie Brown, a twenty-nine-year retired prosecutor,
            interviews ordinary people who say they have experienced a
            supernatural event. Each event is critically reviewed with a
            scathing analysis to assess credibility and legitimacy. Was it a
            supernatural event, or was it an event that can be explained by
            logical reasoning, consistent with the ordinary laws of science and
            physics? Each case is subjected to a prosecutor's analysis for truth
            and veracity and an evaluation of the probability that a jury of
            one's peers would validate or invalidate the legitimacy of the
            supernatural event. Along the way, Bernie describes his own list of
            personal supernatural events and subjects them to the same critical,
            common-sense analysis as all other cases. You will be shocked by his
            stories and the stories he has heard and surprised by his verdicts.
            In the end, your concept of truth and reality will be expanded,
            upended, and redefined; and your perception of the realm of human
            possibilities will never be the same.
