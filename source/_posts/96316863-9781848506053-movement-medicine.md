          <b>Bring the Life of the Dance into the Dance of Your Life<br /></b
          ><br /><i>Movement Medicine</i>&nbsp;is a grounding and uplifting
          modern meditation practice rooted in the traditions of ecstatic dance.
          It's suitable for anybody in a body. Everyone, no matter their age,
          shape or background, has a dancer inside them. This dancer has the
          capacity to access wisdom, vitality and creativity that we cannot
          access with intellect alone. The exercises in this book combine
          movement and meditation to guide you on a profound and
          transformational journey.<br /><br /><i>Movement Medicine</i
          >&nbsp;invites you to take a journey to the soul through 9 Gateways.
          It is informed by a wealth of healing and transformational modalities,
          and is designed to support your soul to grow and flourish to face the
          challenges of life in the 21st century. The 9 Gateways are broken down
          into three journeys, each with a specific intent:<br /><br />The
          Journey of Empowerment - the Gateways of Body, Heart and Mind<br /><br />The
          Journey of Responsibility - the Gateways of Past, Present and
          Future<br /><br />Living the Dream - the Gateways of Fulfilment,
          Interconnection and Realisation.<br /><br />These 9 Gateways are all
          woven together to help you embody your essential self, expand your
          consciousness and live the most creative and fulfilling existence you
          can.

          ‘This wonderful book transcends its genre by being simultaneously
          compelling and graceful – in the fullest sense of those words. <br />
          ‘Visionary but grounded, inspiring but practical, it brims with the
          writers’ joy at their journeys and their utter confidence that equal
          joy is already in the grasp of any reader who cares to walk alongside
          them in this celebration of life, spirit and growth. <br />
          ‘It captures every smile and heartbeat of Susannah and Ya’Acov’s
          real-life teaching, and – like all great wisdom – revels in paradox:
          its most powerful insights are those it presents with the lightest
          touch. Above all, this book is deeply, compassionately human – vivid,
          timeless and universal. It rings with quiet truth and is a delight to
          read.’<br /><b>George Tiffin</b> – TV drama and feature film writer<br /><br />‘Ya’Acov
          &amp; Susannah Darling Khan are pointing out a direction, outlining a
          way for every human being to discover and unfold the essence of their
          movement tendencies. Guided by their visions and dreams, they describe
          archetypal forces emerging and combining into a flow in their movement
          medicine. Try it!’<br /><b>Arny and Amy Mindell </b>– authors of
          <i>Quantum Mind and Healing</i><br /><br />‘Ya’Acov and Susannah have
          through many years of practice and exploration opened up a path of
          self-empowerment and healing, through combining old earth-based
          teachings with contemporary movement practice in their own unique way.
          They are pathfinders and renewers, who dance their talk, and their
          excitement for sharing their discoveries shines through this book.’
          <br /><b>Chris Luttichau</b> – author of <i>Animal Spirit Guides</i>,
          founder and teacher of Northern Drum Shamanic Centre<br /><br />‘This
          book is both a wonderful introduction to Ya’Acov and Susannah’s
          collective life experiences so far and a fabulous instruction manual
          for the next stage. It is also wonderful set of menu options for the
          soul, full of tangy dishes and clashing flavours and the invitation to
          try something different. I particularly love the juxtaposition of
          insight with personal experience – because it takes us right into the
          authors’ own journey – there’s nothing like the wisdom of fellow
          travellers to light up the way.’<br /><b>Nicholas McInery</b> –
          dramatist and screenwriter<br /><br />‘Ya’acov and Susannah are
          inspirational and profound teachers who live, breathe and walk this
          path. This book is a distillation of many years of study and practice.
          I know of no one more qualified, or able, to teach movement as a
          spiritual journey.’ <br /><b>Malcolm Stern</b> – psychotherapist,
          author, TV presenter and co-founder of Alternatives at St James’
          Church, Piccadilly, London<br /><br />‘Movement medicine taps the
          intrinsic dynamism in each of us. The impulse toward wholeness is
          indeed part our miraculous nature, and this book is an elegant cue
          toward the wonders awaiting us. We may discover the human being and
          the cosmos are synonymous. We may learn we are not only entitled to
          this great freedom, but designed for it. Movement Medicineis a
          must-read for mortals.’<br /><b>Stuart Davis</b> – writer, director
          and songwriter<br /><br />‘Ya’Acov and Susannah are seasoned explorers
          of the psyche, who have built up a fantastic and well-deserved
          reputation over the years and this profound body of work represents
          the fruits of a lifetime’s devotion. Not just a flash-in-the-pan
          change-your-life-in-seven-days pretender, this book is a solid
          contribution to the human experiment that can serve as a stalwart
          companion and transformational tool for the rest of your life.’
          <br /><b>Barefoot Doctor</b><br /><br />‘It’s great. Useful, practical
          and inspiring. This is a book that generously offers a wealth of
          combined experience and practical exercises. It is for all who love to
          move and dance and for all who seek fulfillment and expansion on this
          life path home to ourselves. It has so much to offer and can be dipped
          into or read from cover to cover. It combines depth with light
          heartedness and honesty with compassion. It offers a particular path
          and discipline that can be as rigorous or as free as you choose.’
          <br /><b>Sue Kuhn</b> – psychotherapist and accredited 5 Rhythms
          teacher<br /><br />‘If you want to dance your way to God, to
          experience yourself liberated in body, heart and soul, then
          <i>Movement Medicine</i> is an essential orientation. The Darling
          Khans, who write with zest and love, rightly say, “Once we enter the
          flow of our own movement we learn to trust the natural creativity of
          the life force inside us.” We, as explorers in the sphere of human
          sexuality, find <i>Movement Medicine</i> to be real treasure.
          Consciously rooted in the body and embracing the power of elemental
          forces, the reader is invited into 9 Gateways of experience through
          which lie healing, empowerment and transformation.
          <i>Movement Medicine</i> represents a great call to our awakening with
          the reminder that “the spirit of the dance is waiting for you”!’<br /><b
            >Puja Richardson</b
          >
          – author of <i>The Love Keys</i><br /><br />‘This book reminded me of
          an experience with Ya’Acov, who was leading a workshop at the Society
          for Shamanic Practitioners Conference in 2008, when 100 people were
          dancing as one; I again felt that experience of having my inner dancer
          opened up and once more felt myself dancing within a community.
          Wonderful.’<br /><b>Elsa Malpas</b> – Society of Shamanic
          Practitioners<br /><br />‘The recipes are not only great to read, but
          they really work. The personal stories are a delight. This book is
          another reminder of how good it feels to love oneself.’<br /><b
