          “Seeing the world through a multidimensional lens, feeling the world
          through the multisensory being inside you — that is the purpose of
          these conversations.”<br />
          — FROM THE BOOK<br />
          <br />
          Lee Harris has been receiving communication from his guides, the Z’s,
          since 1999. He has made this wisdom available in a variety of ways,
          helping hundreds of thousands around the world, and now he offers
          these powerful messages in a one-of-a-kind and distinctly modern
          format. His channeling is presented in conversation with
          psychotherapist Dianna Edwards, who describes her work as “listening
          to hear.” Her questioning allows for a crystal-clear exploration of
          Lee’s method and a beautifully accessible way of encountering and
          absorbing the wisdom transmitted from the Z’s. You’ll learn to connect
          to your guides, interpret and learn from dreams, employ the magnetics
          of manifestation, and navigate the current environmental and cultural
          disarray. The material channeled from the Z’s is practical and
          meaningful — even transformational — for seekers with open hearts and
          minds.<br />

          “Lee Harris is one of the clearest and most potent channels of our
          time.”<br />

          “While I’ve enjoyed collaborating with many spiritual teachers and
          healers during my time as a past-life psychic over the past two
          decades, every now and then I meet one with an extra-special gift. Lee
          Harris is among the very best. Not only is he an enlightened old soul,
          he’s also a kind and compassionate human whose work is helping elevate
          our collective consciousness. Lee’s new book is everything he is —
          insightful, engaging, and filled with wisdom.”<br />

          “Deep, humorous, moving, educational, and mind-blowing cosmic
          conversation between a down-to-earth psychotherapist and the chatty
          guides of channeler Lee Harris. All you need is an open mind and heart
          to begin. Highly recommended to anyone searching for spiritual solace
          in these chaotic times. Expect to be amazed.”<br />

          “Lee Harris is a uniquely gifted human, a purehearted spiritual
          channel bringing through the healing wisdom needed to awaken our
          world.”<br />
          <strong
            >— Alana Fairchild, musician and bestselling author of Sacred Rebels
            Oracle<br /> </strong
          ><br />
          “Lee Harris is as open and heart-centered a channel as you’ll
          encounter. And his guides, the Z’s, are clear, poignant, and joyful
          messengers of grounding insight and wisdom. At a time when our reality
          can feel more disconnected and overwhelming than ever, these
          conversations reconnected me to the soulful truths of our humanity and
          divinity, and encouraged me to trust more deeply in life’s unfolding.
          Lee and the Z’s help me feel more at peace and at home here, and that
          in itself is a miracle.”<br />
