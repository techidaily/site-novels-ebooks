          If you're going to write a book about worlds with no answers,
          phenomenon that scientists can't explain and skeptics can't
          fathom--you'd better do it with the right equipment--the eye of a
          journalist, the voice of a novelist, an open mind and compassionate
          heart. In Looking for the Other Side, writer Sherry Suib Cohen is
          perfectly outfitted with these tools in her exploration of the world
          of the occult.<br /><br />It all begins when Cohen, a journalist,
          takes an assignment to try and contact the spirit of her deceased mom.
          In her searching, she meets astrologers, past-life channelers,
          numerologists, psychics, and a host of other practitioners eager to
          put her in touch with her past, her future, and her heretofore
          unexplored spiritual self.<br /><br />"Cohen will hook readers with
          her determination, wit, generosity and astonishing willingness to try
          anything. In the end, her personal odyssey becomes ours, and even the
          most devoted skeptics will find themselves rethinking what might and
          what might not be possible."<br />--Betsy Carter, Editor-in-Chief, New
          Woman magazine<br /><br />"When I saw the words know thyself carved
          above the Oracle's gate at Delphi, I shivered--and didn't understand
          why. Now, I understand. Knowing myself would mean suspending judgment,
          would mean tapping into banks of information I never before thought
          relevant to my pragmatic lifestyle. Well, I've tapped. This book is
          the result," writes Sherry Suib Cohen. <br /><br />And in a spirited
          narrative, Cohen tells us about her experiences wherein she confronts
          death, blame, forgiveness, faith, truth, and family, in addition to
          Mom. When readers finish this personal odyssey and guidebook into the
          unknown, they may decide, just as Cohen did, that there's something to
          these otherwordly spheres after all.
