            that are precious and life-sustaining. Read carefully, and listen
            deeply."—Mary Oliver, National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize
            winner</b
          ><br /><br />Inspiring hope, solace, and courage in living through our
          losses, author Martín Prechtel, trained in the Tzutujil Maya shamanic
          tradition, shares profound insights on the relationship between grief
          and praise in our culture--how the inability that many of us have to
          grieve and weep properly for the dead is deeply linked with the
          inability to give praise for living. In modern society, grief is
          something that we usually experience in private, alone, and without
          the support of a community. Yet, as Prechtel says, "Grief expressed
          out loud for someone we have lost, or a country or home we have lost,
          is in itself the greatest praise we could ever give them. Grief is
          praise, because it is the natural way love honors what it misses."<br /><br />Prechtel
          explains that the unexpressed grief prevalent in our society today is
          the reason for many of the social, cultural, and individual maladies
          that we are currently experiencing. According to Prechtel, "When you
          have two centuries of people who have not properly grieved the things
          that they have lost, the grief shows up as ghosts that inhabit their
          grandchildren." These "ghosts," he says, can also manifest as disease
          in the form of tumors, which the Maya refer to as "solidified tears,"
          or in the form of behavioral issues and depression. He goes on to show
          how this collective, unexpressed energy is the long-held grief of our
          ancestors manifesting itself, and the work that can be done to
          liberate this energy so we can heal from the trauma of loss, war, and
          suffering.<br /><br />At base, this "little book," as the author calls
          it, can be seen as a companion of encouragement, a little extra light
          for those deep and noble parts in all of us.

          "Martin Prechtel's book is beautifully written and wise … he offers
          stories that are precious and life-sustaining. Read carefully, and
          listen deeply." <br /><b>—Mary Oliver<br /><br /></b>“Here Martín
          Prechtel sends us an invitation to peace: to personal, village-level,
          and world peace. His indigenous wisdom gives us much-needed insights
          into the reverberating impact of not grieving our heart-rending
          losses. Most poignantly, he shows us the devastating inheritance of
          our ever more voracious wars and the misunderstood burden of ghosts
          that swirl around our modern warriors. Yet, instead of leaving us more
          despondent, every chapter holds out a new seed, breaking into new
          life. Martín coaxes us through funny and quirky turns of the ordinary
          and the miraculous to leave us inspired to wake up singing to the
          beauty of our rising sun and live in praise of this complex and
          gracious world.”<br />—<b>Inge Hindel, </b>MD/PhD, family and
          integrated medicine doctor at Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center,
          Oregon<br /><br />
          “Martín Prechtel’s genius takes many forms: painting, music, a
          continuously evolving learning community, and thank God,
          <i>books </i>like this one. I get so excited reading it, I cannot stay
          in one place. I sit reading on my porch…then back to my living room to
          make a fire and watch Martín’s gorgeously alive prose burn inside me.
          His ideas and language are so enlivening, my impulse is to quote great
          sections of it. I’ll just touch on a few of his brilliant insights
          around how animals help us to grieve, and to make our way out of grief
          into the beauty of praising. As he says, animals help us grieve our
          loss of naturalness. And we have mostly forgotten ‘the very old
          worldwide tribal custom of having a “grief relative” from the wild
          living together with us in our houses.’ Caring for animals is a sacred
          responsibility. To truly grieve and to weep deeply is something the
          animals really do help us with. And O they help us praise too, to
          accomplish that most marvelous art of turning the grief into praising.
          Martín tells us, ‘Let the world jump up and live again,’ and he makes
          that happen with his delicious sentences. Read this necessary, very
          beautiful book, and then read it again.”<br /><b>—Coleman Barks, </b
          >author of <i>Rumi: Soul Fury<br /></i><br />“Many veterans are now
          banding into “warrior societies” but do not know which direction to
          go. In my work, I see on a daily basis many new patients (veterans)
          coming in for help: some with traumatic brain injury (TBI), substance
          abuse (mainly alcohol), post-traumatic disorders, and the
          all-too-frequent ‘suicide attempt’ with which a new generation of
          warriors kick off the repressed memories of Vietnam-era warriors
          remembering what was suppressed for so many years, their minds
          desperately making an attempt to resolve an ungrieved, ghost-ridden
          past.&nbsp;<i>The Smell of Rain on Dust</i>&nbsp;beautifully addresses
          the possibility of a society of warriors so changed by having killed
          that they become a society of healers to heal those wounded in war,
          both old and new.”<br />—<b>John Ishmael,</b>&nbsp;RN BSN, nurse
          physician liaison and discharge planner at Salt Lake City Veterans
          Hospital<br /><br />
          “Alchemy, by definition, metabolizes and transmutes. A reading of
          <i>The Smell of Rain on Dust</i> is alchemical. If the shredding of
          the glorious web of life has you sinking into a depth of despair, read
          this book; your grief can metabolize and transmute such wrongness.
          Deep and delightful, <i>The Smell of Rain on Dust</i> is also
          instructive. It<i> </i>will charm you into wanting to live life more
          fully, to walk in beauty even amongst modernity’s polarized spiritual
          failures.”<br />—<b>Randy Hayes,</b> director of Foundation Earth and
          founder of Rainforest Action Network<br /><br />
          “Once again, Martin Prechtel is up to his old tricks … ‘making
          medicine out of poison.’ <i>The Smell of Rain on Dust </i>takes grief,
          pain, strife, and other elements of a society in distress and concocts
          a potion that actually heals those who have ears to listen. In a world
          that needs to grieve its wrongdoings but has lost its ability or
          forgotten its ancient wisdom to do so, Mr. Prechtel has been selected
          as a spokesman to reunite modern man with ancient wisdom. Not an
          enviable position!”<br />—<b>H. Bruce Coslor,</b> Vietnam veteran,
          Nebraska cattle rancher, songwriter, musician, and grandfather<br /><br />
          “I love Martín’s book. It was amazing reading it aloud to the ocean.
          At one point I moved up the coast assuming the listening birds, seals,
          and whales would stay, but they moved with me. The waves listened and
          the wind. Read this magical book as it takes you into the courtyard of
          the heart.”<br />—<b>M. Bacon,</b> international award-winning
          documentary film director and producer<br /><br />
          “This wonderful book <i>The Smell of Rain on Dust</i> not only
          addresses this culture’s lack of grief but it discusses in poignant
          ways how our inability to grieve has created many of our culture’s
          delirious, fast paced, toxic, constant state-of-emergency symptoms
          where depression, addiction, and mediocrity reign. As a mother,
          daughter, teacher, and farmer I found this book to stir up a deep
          prayer, that as a people we might, one day, through being with the
          depths of our grief, find so much love and deliciousness in being
          alive that we praise this life so genuinely, nothing is left
          unloved.”<br />—<b>Melanie MacKinnon,</b> teacher, farmer, and owner
          of Frog Belly Farms, Colorado<br /><br />“I held my personal grief for
          decades until, with the help of the author, I ceremonially metabolized
          my grief into a thing of beauty. Like a magic genie, I popped out of
          the bottle I had crawled into with a renewed love of life. In
          <i>The Smell of Rain on Dust: Grief and Praise,</i> Prechtel leads the
          reader down this same trail of animals and life in the womb while
          revealing that grief is the sister of praise. Like Prechtel’s other
          books, this astonishing book draws me back to reexamine the beauty of
          a life lived well.”<br />—<b>Wick Fisher,</b> retired postmaster,
          Vietnam veteran, and orator at soldier funerals<br /><br />
          “Brilliant gems of storytelling illuminate teachings of inspiration
          and hope in this new work by Martin Prechtel, a work to which he
          brings a traditional indigenous understanding of how to deal with
          loss.”<br />—<b>Michael Harner, </b>author of
          <i>Cave and Cosmos </i>and founder of the Foundation for Shamanic
          Studies
