          A fully illustrated history of the Temple of Solomon <br />
          <br />• Examines the Temple of Solomon in the Hebrew Scriptures, the
          New Testament, and Apocryphal writings <br />
          <br />• Explores its role in the founding of Freemasonry, the legends
          of the Knights Templar, the doctrines of the Kabbalah, and the
          teachings of Islam <br />
          <br />• Explains the sacred nature of the Temple Mount--the site of
          the Temple of Solomon--and the secrets that may still be hidden there
          <br />
          <br />• Richly illustrated, including many photos and images from rare
          archives <br />
          <br />The spiritual heart of many esoteric societies, the Temple of
          Solomon was located atop the Temple Mount in Jerusalem, a site
          venerated by the three great monotheistic religions as the
          intersection of Divine and human. Built by King Solomon at the peak of
          ancient Israel’s power, the Temple of Solomon housed the golden Ark of
          the Covenant in its Holy of Holies, a sacred chamber where one could
          communicate directly with God. Centuries after the temple’s
          destruction, the Temple Mount was used as the headquarters for the
          Knights Templar during the Crusades, and countless legends have come
          down through the centuries about the secrets they may have uncovered
          there, including discovery of the Holy Grail or the Ark of the
          Covenant. <br />
          <br />Richly illustrated with biblical and Masonic illustrations,
          photographs, and ancient and modern paintings--many from rare
          archives--this book explores the Temple of Solomon in the Hebrew
          Scriptures, the New Testament, and Apocryphal writings as well as its
          role in the founding of Freemasonry, the legends of the Knights
          Templar, the doctrines of the Kabbalah, and Muhammad’s visionary
          journey from the Temple Mount through the heavens. Seeking to
          understand the powerful desire of many religions and secret societies
          to re-create the temple through ritual and prayer, James Wasserman
          explains why it was built, the magical forces King Solomon may have
          used in its creation, what its destruction meant for Jews and
          Christians alike, and why the Knights Templar as well as several
          modern secret societies named their orders after it. Detailing the
          sacred architecture of this perfectly proportioned mystical edifice
          through words and art, the author reveals the Temple of Solomon as the
          affirmation of God’s presence in human affairs, the spiritual root of
          Western culture, and an important monument to the Divine nearly
          forgotten in today’s secular times but sorely needed to bridge the
          divide between our ancient past and our spiritual future.

          “Erudite and gorgeously illustrated,
          <i>The Temple of Solomon</i> places the Jerusalem Temple in its
          historical and cultural perspective, drawing on sacred books and
          ancient historians alike to trace the history of the Tabernacle, the
          First and Second Temples, and the Temple as a visionary experience and
          esoteric paradigm through more than three thousand years of
          transformations. This is essential reading not only for students of
          esoteric spirituality and ancient mysteries but also for anyone
          fascinated by the lore of the world’s most famous holy place.”
