          Instead of her brother’s death being an ending that she dreaded, it
          became a beginning that she was able to embrace. Just as many have

          “Becky writes with openness, clarity, humor, great compassion and
          heart. Within the specific literature related to spirituality and
          occupational therapy, Becky exemplifies the 3 ‘T’s of spirituality:
          transcendence, transpersonal experience and transformation.
          Transcendence acknowledges and focuses on a world and experiences
          beyond the tangible one we engage every day. Transpersonal experiences
          highlight the often unimaginable and powerful mystical experiences
          that can bring one greater life and joy. And transformation is present
          in the changing attention and adaptation to new life roles and the
          evolving knowing of self. It will cause pause for consideration and
          provide delight allowing wondrous possibilities of another life to
          emerge.”<br /><b>—Tamera Humbert,</b> editor of

          the heart and souls plight through grief and loss and culminates in a
          series of experiences that opens our author into worlds not ordinarily
          known. This work follows an ancient path whereby the boundaries of
          inner and outer worlds collapse. The initiate is led through the mists
          of time, guides, and healing agencies arrive and revelations of deep
          mystery and nature are shared. The neophyte is initiated into the
          deeper mysteries of life and death and in turn is herself reborn.”<br /><b

          consciousness has no limits, Austill-Clausen deftly weaves a story of
          unfolding that has clarity, simplicity, and power. This book should be
          read by anyone experiencing the awakening of consciousness.”<br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Rebecca Austill-Clausen, MS is a Reiki Master Teacher, Occupational
          Therapist, award-winning author, and inspirational speaker. She had no
          psychic or spiritual experience when she discovered her ability to
          communicate with her deceased brother. Austill-Clausen struggled with
          how her spiritual awakening and eventual spiritual transformation
          could mesh with the practical everyday world but knew she had to find
          a way to make it happen. Austill-Clausen kept her spiritual adventures
          quiet for twenty years while she explored multiple spiritual avenues
          including after-death communication, automatic writing, meditation,
          shamanism, Reiki, sound healing, past life regression, crystal energy,
          and even adventures with the fairy realm. Simultaneously she became a
          leader in national and state Occupational Therapy activities.
          Eventually, after growing her one-person private rehabilitation
          practice to 375 therapists, servicing 13,000 clients a year, she
          gained the courage to share her story, sold her business, and now
          teaches empowering After-Death Communication workshops and Reiki
          trainings worldwide.<br /><br /><b>About the Illustrator</b>: Micki

          crayon. She holds a BFA from West Chester University, a teaching
          certificate from Moore College of Art and Design, and a master’s in
          Art Education at Kutztown University. She taught art for five years at
          a Pennsylvania cyber charter school, and spent two years as Education

          McAllister, who believes that nature and beauty have power to heal the
          soul, is now focusing on her own artwork, with nature as a primary
          subject.
