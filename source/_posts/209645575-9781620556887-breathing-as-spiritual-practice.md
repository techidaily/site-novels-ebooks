          A guide to meditative breathing practices in Western religions and how
          these practices provide a direct experience of God <br /><br />•
          Reveals how Western spiritual traditions, such as the Book of Genesis,
          the Jewish teachings of <i>ruach</i>, and the poetry of Rumi, contain
          hidden instruction for meditative breathing practices <br /><br />•
          Explains how breathing practices can bring all of us, including
          Christians, Muslims, and Jews, closer to a direct experience of the
          palpable presence of God <br /><br />• Provides guidelines and best
          practices for meditative breathing through a personal journal of the
          author’s own meditative retreat <br /><br />Surprised by the number of
          attendees from Western spiritual traditions at his Buddhist retreats,
          Will Johnson wanted to understand what drew them to this type of
          spiritual experience. He found many devoted Christians were in search
          of a more direct experience of God beyond faith alone, so he began
          exploring what breathing practices could be found in the sacred texts
          of Western monotheistic religions. Johnson discovered that, like their
          Eastern counterparts, Western traditions speak of gaining direct
          access to God via the breath. After experimenting with these teachings
          during a 10-day retreat at a desert monastery, he discovered that each
          of us has the potential to open up to the presence of spirit in every
          breath. <br /><br />In this book, the author offers a close look at
          the importance of breath in each major Western religion, including the
          Jewish teachings of <i>ruach</i> as life-giving spirit in the form of
          breath and the Islamic poetry of Rumi, which describes breath as
          essential for cleansing the soul. He then ties each breathing
          tradition to the Book of Genesis, sacred to Christians, Muslims, and
          Jews alike: “<i
            >And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed
            into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living
            being</i
          >.” Just as God blew life into Adam, every breath we take--if we
          follow the breathing practice of surrendering completely to
          inhalation--can open us up to the presence of God. <br /><br />Through
          his own contemplative journey, Johnson shares his experience of
          striving to surrender to the fullest presence of God through each
          breath. As he takes the reader step-by-step through his own breathing
          practice, the author explains his physical and mental techniques for
          meditating successfully through breath and provides helpful guidelines
          to get the most out of meditative retreats. Johnson also offers deep
          reflections on how these shared practices of experiencing God through
          the breath transcend religious differences.

          “Will Johnson sounds a clarion call for integration to a fragmented
          world. Ever the quintessential body and breath awareness teacher,
          Johnson skillfully brings together the three monotheistic religions by
          way of a spiritual practice common to all. Interwoven with his own
          candid, sometimes poignant, personal experience, Johnson offers a
          message of hope to all of us, wherever we find ourselves in our desire
          to be present to what is.”
