            <i>He's Just Not in the Stars</i> is a sinful combination of
            <i>He's Just Not That into You</i>, <i>Sex and the City</i>, and
            <i>The Secret Language of Birthdays</i>. If all is fair in love and
            war, this is the right ammunition. . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            Hindsight is 20/20. Love is blind. With all that good and bad vision
            out there, who's gonna give you some serious insight?
          </p>
          <p>
            Sex columnist and love astrology expert Jenni Kosarin is taking
            names and kicking astrological butt. . . . Flirt. Crush. Boyfriend.
            Ex-boyfriend. Husband. Whatever. What's his potential? What's he
            looking for? How do you fix things once you've messed up? Which sign
            will give you another chance and which won't? Find out his
            idiosyncrasies <i>before</i> you date him. Find out who's ready for
            a relationship and who'll still be hanging out in twentysomething
            bars in fifteen years. (Uh. Creepy.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Here, get the scoop on how <i>your man</i> stacks up. Decipher.
            Crack the code. Get stellar advice.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept is revolutionary: Combine his Sun Sign with his Venus.
            That's all. No "rising signs," no tricking his mother into telling
            you what time he was born. No cookie-cutter generalizations. This
            book is frighteningly specific. Filled with sixty easy-to-follow
            combos, it's illustrated with ironic, gossip-filled, shocking
            real-life examples of famous celebs such as:
          </p>
          <p></p>
          Colin Firth (Virgo, Venus in Libra): Virgo + Libra = sexy and subtle
          combo
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          Orlando Bloom (Capricorn, Venus in Pisces): Capricorn is all for
          security, Pisces is a full-on romantic = good guy
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          Chris Rock (Aquarius, Venus in Capricorn): Aquarius can be about
          partnership when Capricorn grounds it
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          Ethan Hawke (Scorpio, Venus in Scorpio): Ladykiller double sign combo
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          Antonio Banderas (Leo, Venus in Virgo): Hint: the Virgo makes him stay
          <p></p>
          <p>
            . . . plus many, many others. By defining him in a way that's never
            been done before, <i>He's Just Not in the Stars</i> gives it to you
            straight. No tiptoeing around. No hugging and sharing. No coddling.
            Deal with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Cue drum roll.) This is for the woman who wants to take charge of
            her own destiny. Is he in the stars? Time won't tell. Jenni Kosarin
            will.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>He's Just Not in the Stars</i> is the last hip, irreverent
            relationship book you'll ever want. Throw away the rest . . .
          </p>
          <p>
            They're taking up space where your happily married pictures should
            go.
