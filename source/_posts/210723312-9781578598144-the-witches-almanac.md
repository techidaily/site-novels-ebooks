            possibly wielding magical powers and a stigma surrounding
            practitioners of ancient rituals and practices. Yet, in the last 70
            years, witchcraft, as well as Wicca, have gone from taboo beliefs
            pursued by a handful of eccentrics and misfits to major global,
            spiritual movements. Meet the troublemakers and rebels who pushed

          “★ Starred Review. ... a true compendium of who’s who in the world of
          witchcraft throughout Western civilization. ... Each chapter defines
          an era of how magic and witches were perceived, defined, accepted, or
          persecuted in Europe and North America. The book provides numerous
          known details about the lives of practitioners of magic, witches, and
          alchemists, from the Middle Ages to the age of TikTok. ... Extremely
          thorough and engagingly written, this title is an excellent historical
          reference for readers and students of the occult and witchcraft.” –
          <i>Library Journal</i><br /><br />“... And as far as operating as a
          “biographical dictionary” of magicians, “<i>The Witches Almanac</i>”
          does a fantastic job. I was hard pressed to think of any practitioners
          that may have been missed. Also, rest assured, “<i
            >The Witches Almanac</i
          >” has an excellent index, just in case you want to find a specific
          person. If you’re looking for a rough history of magic that has the
          main focus on the practitioners that shaped it, “<i
            >The Witches Almanac</i
          >” by Charles Christian is not to be missed!” –
          <i>The Magical Buffet</i><br /><br />“… truly an engaging must-read
          that will give insight to the witchcraft that has been seen in history
          such as witch trials, popes accused of sorcery, and even Henry VII’s
          accusations of Anne Boleyn. … riveting biographies in a well-organized
          format with some that date back to Apollonius of Tyana (c. 3 B.C.E-97
          C.E.) and going to modern witches such as Starhawk and Zsuzsanna
          Budapest. There hasn’t been another book like this that contains this
          vast of an assortment pertaining to witches. An incredible resource
          that touches upon the history of witches in an almanac that is perfect
          for readers interested in witches and history, those studying wicca,
          students, and teachers.” – <i>Manhattan Book Review</i
          ><br /><br />“... reins in a significant volume of biographical and
          historical material. A plethora of personalities and events are
          considered ... the book begins in the Classical world ...
          contextualises the Middle Ages and the Renaissance periods …
          theocratic authoritarianism of the 16th and 17th centuries gives way
          to a heterodox cauldron of alchemy, ceremonial magic, Freemasonry and
          “toad bone” cunning folk ... draws a clear genealogical line between
          the centuries … By concluding with a brief mention of a more recent
          trend in North American witchcraft ... he strikes a positive note
          amidst a dark and disturbing history in part. ... A thoroughly
          enjoyable survey with copious illustrations, thematic inset panels,
          index and basic bibliography ...” – <i>Fortean Times</i
          ><br /><br />“... profiles about 360 witches and sorcerers from
          antiquity to the present, focusing on the Western/English-speaking
          world. He organizes individuals by theme or chronological era, such as
          the Middle Ages, witches at the royal courts of Europe, the Salem
          Witch Trials, feminism, witchcraft in postwar Germany, witch-hunts and
          black magic in modern times, and witchcraft in the digital age, with
          introductory information on the historical context and issues,
          followed by biographical entries. He does not include fictional
          characters or Satanism, Devil worship, Wicca, or other variants of
          Neopagan religion.” – <i>Book News</i><br /><br />“… a biographical
          directory of witches, sorcerers, and individuals who practiced magical
          arts. … Each section is introduced by a multi-page essay that provides
          background context and sets the scene regarding the prevalence of
          witchcraft and its legal, religious, and social influence on everyday
          life. … Many of these accounts are surprisingly detailed, perhaps due
          to having been recorded in church records or legal proceedings …” –
