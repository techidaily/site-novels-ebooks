            "Gods Perfect Timing: Breaking the Cycle of Poverty with Education
            and Faith is about how important events in our lives happen
            according to Gods timing, not our own. Come with me on a spiritual
            journey through poverty, child abuse, and my struggle to overcome
            dyslexia through special education. I share a chilling account of
            how I survived being struck by lightning at football practice at the
            beginning of my senior year of high school. After my dream of
            becoming a professional athlete got shattered, I survived on the
            streets with dangerous criminals."
          </p>
          <p>
            Can you make lightning appear and cause it to strike as you direct?
            (Job 38:35)
          </p>
          <p>Lucky to Be Alive</p>
          <p>
            For on August 18, Caruth was standing in the defensive backfield
            during Coronados football practice when an incredible event knocked
            him right off the football field and literally into medical
            journals. Dressed in full football gear, Caruth was struck by on the
            head by a bold of lightning. The bolt burned through protective
            padding in the helmet at the point where a metal screw was fixed,
            blacked the neck of his jersey, singed his pants, and left his socks
            looking as though theyd been treated with a blowtorch.
          </p>

          Forward By Reverend Alfonso WyattI spent my career as an educator,
          youth developer, advocate, counselor, role model and minister
          transforming the lives of countless young people caught in tumultuous
          life circumstances beyond their control or choosing. The
          aforementioned perspective allows me to understand and appreciate the
          profound power contained in Gods Perfect Timing: Breaking The Cycle of
          Poverty with Education and Faith, by Dr. David D. Caruth. Brother
          Caruth unapologetically takes readers into his world and lays bare
          horrific childhood events namely: physical/sexual abuse, hunger,
          deprivation, physical, emotional challenges as well as the need for
          special education. If this were not enough, David, as a promising high
          school football player, with dreams of turning pro, was struck by
          lightning while on the practice field100 players were leveled by the
          bolt, David was the only one that did not get up. The story could have
          ended right there with yet another African American child failing to
          thrive, doomed to living in the now all-too-familiar clutch of
          poverty, crime, drugs, gangs, incarceration, nihilism and neglector
          dying too soon.The seeds of failure were clearly sown into the life
          and psyche of the author. Yet the reader will discover that in the
          midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, David is able to change the
          odds. This social miracle was accomplished by seeds planted by Davids
          mother, namely the seed of faith revealed in the telling of biblical
          stories like David and Goliath (a Divine metaphor if you will).This
          book shows educators, faith leaders, policy makers, parents, young
          people and yes, even the naysayer, how the cycle of poverty,
          perpetuated by low self-esteem, academic indifference, victim
          thinking/blaming and dysfunctional family life can be broken once and
          for all.So beloved, come on the arduous and ultimately triumphant
          journey of David D. Caruths lifetime. If you accept this invitation
          please be open to the reality that the same power that found a young
          boy at his most vulnerable time; the same power that snatched him from
          the sure grip of death; the same power that helped him overcome
          staggering life obstacles and receive a terminal degree, is the same
          power that can change the lives of readersnow that Gods Perfect Timing
          is in full effect. The Reverend Alfonso Wyatt has four decades of
          experience developing young people as well as working with public,
          private, community based youth serving organizations and the faith
          community involved in the same effort. Reverend Wyatt, a D.Min
          candidate at New York Theological Seminary, is an ordained Elder on
          the ministerial staff of The Greater Allen Cathedral of New York and
          he and his wife are co-authors of Soul Be Free Poems Prose
          Prayers.PrefaceGods Perfect Timing: Breaking the Cycle of Poverty with
          Education and Faith is about how important events in our lives happen
          according to Gods timing, not our own. Come with me on a spiritual
          journey through poverty, child abuse, and my struggle to overcome a
          learning disability through special education. I share a chilling
          account of how I survived being struck by lightning at football
          practice at the beginning of my senior year of high school. After my
          dream of becoming a professional athlete got shattered, I survived on
          the streets with dangerous criminals.Throughout my life, my mom, Zelna
          A. Caruth, was my primary source of strength. She was raised in
          Chicago and overcame more adversity in her life than anyone I knew.
          Her father died in a fire when she was 4 years old and her mother
          passed away when she was 12. As the oldest of four siblings, with two
          younger sisters and a baby brother, she called Bugs, her childhood
          ended at a very early age. She was also my most important teacher and
          source of strength. She taught me not to criticize or judge others
          until I walked a mile in their moccasins. I understood her lessons,
          because I had seven older brothers and sisters and one younger sister,
          and my own shoes had cutout cardboard for bottoms. Like a sponge, I
          absorbed as much of my moms wisdom as I could. She taught me about the
          Bible, and to believe that God works in mysterious ways. She let me
          know early on in life that man would let me down, and that I needed to
          put my faith and trust in the Lord. If I trusted in the Lord, she
          would say, and not worry so much about what other people had, only
          then would I begin to see the miracles that God was performing in my
          own life. She was right of course. When I look at my own life, there
          are numerous times, too many to count, when my life could have, and
          probably should have ended, and God made a miracle happen to keep me
          going. I also learned that not all miracles are pleasant. Unpleasant
          miracles are difficult for most of us to grasp. We find it difficult
          to understand why a loving God would not only allow, but cause
          unpleasant events to happen in our lives. I questioned my mom about
          why bad things happened to good people and good things happened to bad
          people. My moms answer was that, God allowed Jesus to die on the
          cross, only to raise him from the dead to glorify his own power. She
          left it to me to figure out the meaning of her words.For most of us,
          those with children anyway, we find it difficult to imagine allowing
          our child to be crucified so that the world could bear witness to our
          power. God help us if our children get injured on fields of play. If
          our children get hurt, our hearts fill with pain and sadness, and we
          want the world to see us rush to comfort them. We grow up learning
          that people who love us should protect us from unpleasant events that
          occur daily in our own lives. In our house, my brothers and sisters
          seldom felt protected. What we felt on most days was hunger, jealousy,
          misery, envy and multiple kinds of abuse. I wrote this book, because I
          believe that, in spite of the challenges we face and endure day after
          day, miracles happen every day of our lives; however, most of the
          time, we dont recognize them when we see them. After reading this
          book, my hope is that you will begin to see how God works through
          people to influence the lives of other people. You will learn how to
          recognize Gods Perfect Timing in your own life, and to take action
          when the time is right. If God can bring me through poverty, child
          abuse and special education, back from death and homelessness, to
          earning a PhD, buying several homes for my family, and sending my
          children to private school, then you too should be able to have faith
          that God has a design on your life, and has already blessed you with
          miracle after miracle.
