          <p>
            Life is a progressive drama where choices and consequences shape us
            to be who we are. Hope often fades when the circumstances of our
            life are not what we expected them to be. But, if we choose to;
            Capture our thoughts, confront in truth and communicate in love,
            nothing is impossible!
          </p>
          <p>
            This is my story of 'one moment in time' that changed my life
            forever! A journey of significant choices made while enduring
            struggle, loss and suffering, through twelve years of debilitating
            chronic sickness, emotional pain and wheelchair dependency, that
            caused momentary depths of despair and nearly took my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a journey from Pain to Peace, Guilt to Grace, Fear to Faith,
            Hurt to Hope and from Confusion to Clarity.

        <p><strong>ENDORSEMENTS</strong></p>
        <p>
          Life can be a struggle. At times, we get bruised and battered. When I
          first got to know Grace, she was suffering an ongoing physical ordeal,
          on top of the effects of bullying behaviour by an employer, rejection
          by a close friend and the daily challenges of accepting personal care
          carried out by strangers. Though it all, Grace maintained a trust in
          Jesus. This is a truly inspiring account of the unique and personal
          way in which He demonstrated He is worthy of such trust. I witnessed
          at first hand Graces's remarkable healing. Yet, time and again, this
          story points to God's precious and powerful presence in the long
          journey of suffering.

        <p>
          I have seen Grace in her wheelchair, very frail and very fragile, and
          I have seen Grace walking tall, all shining with health. In both
          conditions, her faith in holding tight to the Lord was obvious. This
          is a remarkable story of miraculous divine healing, but it is the even
          more remarkable story of Grace's journey into allowing healing into
          all her hurt places!
