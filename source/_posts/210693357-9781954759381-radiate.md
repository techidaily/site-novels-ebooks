            Rochel Rittger’s book, Radiate: Change Your Frequency, Change Your
            Life, is based on her lifelong interest in helping and serving
            others. Rochel spent 23+ years of her adult life as a licensed
            sports medicine professional — and then she discovered medical
            Qigong (“a system of coordinated body-posture and movement,
            breathing, and meditation used for the purposes of martial-arts
            training, spirituality, and health” — Wikipedia) a 5,00-year-old
            energy medicine. In the book, Rochel uses her more than 20 years
            worth of Qigong discipleship and training to assist people who are
            stuck in business or in life, helping them uncover what is holding
            them back so they can deal with it and then thrive and move forward
            in their life in the most empowered and vibrant way. She uses her
            skill as a Qigong Master Healer and Certified Instructor to walk
            readers through step-by-step, life-changing, and life-sustaining
            exercises to release their deeply buried pain that has been a
            barrier to their progress in business and/or their private lives.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In the first chapter, after Rochel discusses the meaning of a quote
            from Nikola Tesla, the inventor, (“If you want to find the secrets
            of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and
            vibration”), she walks you through the steps and methods for
            choosing the frequency you want your life to be on. And she walks
            you through methods for employing a daily Qigong practice, daily
            meditation, and a yoga exercise, as well as practicing techniques
            for being present. As you read further in the book, Rochel trains
            you how to adjust your bodily frequency to help you choose what’s
            best for your eating, breathing, the water you drink, and your
            physical and spiritual fitness. Even more, she shows you how to
            choose the right words and emotions to optimize/integrate your
            mental, emotional, and physical frequency. And she helps you connect
            to your inner divinity.

        <p>
          Rochel Rittgers is an Energy Master, a Life Coach, a breakthrough
          strategist, and the CEO of Infinite Living, LLC, where she assists
          people who are stuck in business or in life, helping them uncover what

          in the most empowered and vibrant way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rochel has pursued spirituality all her life. Only relatively recently
          did she realize that spirituality could be combined with her other
          love — caring for the human body. In 2005, after 23 years practicing
          as a licensed sports medicine professional, she discovered medical
          Qigong, a 5000-year-old energy medicine. She became a disciple and
          eventually a medical-spiritual professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          For 15 years, Rochel studied Qigong extensively under International
          Qigong Master Chunyi Lin, and she daily practices the powerful Spring
          Forest Qigong techniques. She has become a Master Healer and Certified
          Instructor for three classes of Qigong. She is an Instructor of the
          instructors for the SFQigong community and has found that Qigong
          techniques are life-changing and life-sustaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rochel has also been under the guidance of Kriya Yoga/Meditation
          Master, Kambiz Naficy, under the lineage of Babaji since 2009, with
          whom she has studied ancient texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and
          Upanishads and has become certified as a Life Coach.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is a Metaphysical Minister and Medical Intuitive who excels in

          is available for distant or local, individual or group, healings.
        </p>
        <p>

          Gardens.
