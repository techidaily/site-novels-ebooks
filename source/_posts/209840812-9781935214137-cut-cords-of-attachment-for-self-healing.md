            Cords of attachment may be the most significant, treatable cause of
            problems in your life, keeping you stuck in old patterns. This is
            the first book to teach cord-cutting for self-healing in the
            simplest possible form that provides dependable, permanent, big-deal
            results.<br /><br />Yes, cutting cords of attachment just got easier
            -- for doing a method that really delivers results. Since Rose
            Rosetree published the first how-to book on a quality method for
            cord-cutting in 2007, interest has surged. Today, so many of us want
            to move out these energy drains, whether they are called psychic
            cords, energy cords, energetic cords, etheric cords, or astral
            cords.<br /><br />Cut Cords of Attachment for SELF-HEALING presents
            a clear, systematic explanation of what to do, in what order, so you
            can receive permanent healing.<br /><br />You might want to use this
            self-healing manual as a supplement to Rosetree's definitive book in
            the field, "Cut Cords of Attachment with ENERGY SPIRITUALITY."<br /><br />Either
            book can teach you how to use the only trademarked system in America
            for cord-cutting, 12 Steps to Cut Cords of AttachmentÂ®. Frankly,
            this book is quicker, easier. Instructions here will make your
            self-healing as simple as could be, while maintaining the quality
            you deserve.<br /><br />Besides preparing you to excel at
            self-healing, this little book can help you as a consumer. One read
            through will help you to understand clearly what is involved in a
            quality healing... and how to discern whether a practitioner has
            professional caliber skills.<br /><br />This book also makes a great
            preparation for (or follow-up to) another how-to book this series of
            Energy HEALING Skills for the Age of Awakening: "Use Your Power of
            Command for Spiritual Cleansing and Protection." Completely
            different skill sets for de-cluttering your aura and subconscious
            mind!<br /><br />Bring on a better life, more success and enjoyment
            in the here-and-now. Move forward faster on your personal path to
            Enlightenment by cutting cords of attachment for self-healing.

          Praise for "Cut Cords of Attachment: Heal Yourself and Others with
          Energy Spirituality""Cutting cords is not new; however, Rosetree's
          book is new. I am not aware of any other book on the market that gives
          theories on cutting cords, as well as how-to. Personally, I practiced
          and trained others on cutting cords for over 20 years. Because of my
          background and experiences I had with my clients, I feel Rosetree's
          book is precise and accurate. "Cut Cords of Attachment" would
          certainly have been part of the curriculum if it was available while I
          was teaching classes."-- Irene Watson for Midwest Book Reviews"Are
          your interactions with your brother dominated by memories of childhood
          bullying?Does your college roommate always bring you down with her
          anger at men?Do you find yourself defending your life choices to your
          mom?Whatever the pattern, Rosetree says, you can preserve the
          relationship while cutting the cord that binds, freeing you in new
          ways."-- Brandeis University Magazine"Rose Rosetree mentions a client
          who had been to another healer to remove a cord of attachment. Rather
          than remove the cord, the healer had actually masked it and numbed it
          down. This has the effect of not only keeping the energetic connection
          in place but making it less conscious for healing. Energetic band-aids
          are not a solution."-- David Buckland for the blog "Observations on
          the Way Home"
