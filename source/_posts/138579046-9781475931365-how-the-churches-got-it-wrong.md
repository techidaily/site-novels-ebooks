          <p>
            When the founders of the early Christian Church created the
            Christian religion, were they able to capture the truth as found in
            the actual words of Jesus Christ? In looking at the history of our
            Christian institutions, it becomes evident that His message of love
            and compassion has been completely overlooked by the Christian
            leaders who have defined Jesus Christ. This book will be our
            spiritual journey to find the truth in the message of Jesus Christ.
            And the true message of Jesus Christ is about peace, hope and love.
            Sadly, His message has been ignored and distorted by our Christian
            institutions. The Christ message of love was given to all humanity,
            and we all possess the capacity to learn this message. His Gospel of
            love was never intended to be a collection of creeds and doctrines
            created by a select group of self-appointed clerical middle-men.
            Their creation of creeds, doctrines and dogma has resulted in
            division, disputation and bloodshed.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is my effort to reveal the truth in the message of Christ,
            as expressed in His actual words. Because of social, political and
            psychological factors motivating the early Church leaders, they were
            unable to give us a Christian theology that reflects the real
            meaning of the unconditional love found in the Gospel of Jesus
            Christ. If we are to experience the truth of Jesus Christ, we must
            re-visit the actual words of Jesus Christ to apprehend His message
            of love. By eliminating the erroneous interpretations made by
            clerical middle-men, we can formulate our own thoughts based on the
            actual message of Jesus Christ. It is my sincere hope that we will
            make this search as though we are spiritual archeologists, digging
            for the truth that has remained buried under two-thousand years of
            obfuscation.
          </p>
          <p>
            With our new understanding of what Christ was teaching us, it will
            be our time to know the true meaning of Christianity. We will
            investigate the message of Christ by utilizing the canonical gospels
            to explore the words of Jesus Christ. We will also refer to other
            Christian Gospels that were very popular amongst the early
            Christians, but, due to the politics of power, these Christian
            Gospels were excluded from the New Testament Bible Canon. In
            addition to these sources, we will further explore other ancient
            texts that were influential within the early Christian communities
            such as the books found in the Corpus Hermeticum. Our journey will
            take us to unexpected and exciting insights. We will discover why
            our Christian institutions are failing. The truth, as expressed in
            the message of Christ, is to be found in the actual words of Jesus
            Christ. Unfortunately, His truth has been lost in the creation of
            abstruse creeds and complicated doctrines by Church leaders. In
            creating their Christian theology, the early orthodox Church leaders
            were mainly interested in establishing and projecting their
            authority over all other Christian sects and political institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            True Christianity is not about judgment and condemnation. Jesus
            Christ taught us that God is a loving Father and, as such, we have
            no reasons to fear our Father. It is our responsibility, as
            individuals, to discover the new reality of Christian love, and it
            will be our task to practice what we learn. True Christianity is
            universal kinship. The words of Jesus Christ, as recorded in both
            canonical and non-canonical sources, will be used as our spiritual
            road map. In the early years, after the death of Jesus Christ, men
            created the Christian religion, and their creation has resulted in
            our modern Christian institutions. Unfortunately, we have inherited
            churchianity. And true Christianity has yet to be discovered.

            will be our spiritual journey to find the lost Gospel of Jesus
            Christ. It is our journey back home to our spiritual Garden of Eden.
            It will be our journey to discover the truth about unconditional
            love, as expressed by Jesus Christ, and He did not intend for this
            truth to be hidden by men who are mainly interested in the
            development of ecclesiastical power. Christ gave us a message of
            love: love God and love one another. The message of Jesus Christ
            belongs to all of us, and it is our responsibility to understand His
            truth. The future is ours and our potential for spiritual
            development is unlimited. In the Gospels, Jesus Christ is teaching
            us that we can perform greater deeds than those performed by Him.
            The choice is ours and our future awaits us.<strong></strong>
