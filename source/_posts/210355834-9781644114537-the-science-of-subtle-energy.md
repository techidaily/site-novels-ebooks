          • Shares the results of the author’s rigorous, repeatable, and
          predictable experiments with subtle energy <br /><br />• Shows how the
          mind interacts with matter by means of subtle energy--the key to the
          placebo effect, the healing power of affirmations and prayers, and
          energy medicine <br /><br />• Demonstrates how to harness subtle
          energy and explains the author’s technology to generate subtle energy
          formulations with practical applications <br /><br />Instruments of
          modern physics can measure the energies of the electromagnetic
          spectrum, but these energies only account for roughly 4 percent of the
          total identifiable mass-energy of the universe. What makes up the
          remaining 96%? <br /><br />In this scientifically based yet accessible
          analysis, Yury Kronn, Ph.D., explores the nature of the remaining 96%
          of the universe’s mass-energies. Contemporary science calls this
          massenergy “dark matter,” and the ancients called it life force,
          prana, or chi. Kronn shows how this subtle energy belongs to the
          subatomic world and how it follows laws that are fundamentally
          different from those known to contemporary science.<br /><br />Sharing
          the results of his rigorous, repeatable, and predictable experiments
          with subtle energy, the author looks at the possible mechanisms of
          subtle energy’s interaction with physical matter and with the human
          body. He shows how the mind interacts with matter by means of subtle
          energy—giving us the key to understanding the placebo effect and
          extrasensory perception as well as the healing power of affirmations
          and energy medicine. Kronn demonstrates how it’s possible to harness
          subtle energy and explains his development of Vital Force Technology,
          which integrates ancient knowledge of the life force with modern
          technology to generate specific subtle energy formulations for
          practical applications. He presents his experimental results creating
          subtle energy formulas to positively influence the germination of
          seeds and the growth of plants. He also demonstrates the possibility
          of using subtle energy for creating clean and energetic-pollution-free
          environments for vitality and better healing. <br /><br />Outlining
          the many benefits of subtle energy technology to individuals,
          societies, and the planet as a whole, Kronn reveals how the
          transformative power of subtle energy arises from the vast potential
          of human consciousness.

          “A fascinating account of a high technology designed to record and use
          subtle energies. Kronn’s impressive background as a physicist adds
          credibility to his methods, and the experiments reported in this book
          will be of vital interest to anyone studying the still-mysterious
          phenomenon of subtle energies.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          Yury Kronn, Ph.D. (1935-2021), was a world-renowned scientist,
          inventor, and leading theoretician in physics. He earned his doctorate
          at Russia’s prestigious Gorky University and was awarded a Doctor of
          Sciences degree by Lebedev Physical Institute of Moscow. The coauthor
          of <i>Resonant Nonlinear Interactions of Light with Matter</i>, as
          well as the author of more than 80 scientific articles, he was
          involved in subtle energy physics research for the last 30 years of
          his life.
