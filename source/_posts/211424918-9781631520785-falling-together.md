          There are times in life that shake us to our very foundations. We wish
          for things to get better, fast. But the truth is that moments of
          “falling apart” are also our most powerful catalysts for growth and
          change. In <i>Falling Together</i>, Donna Cardillo, a registered
          nurse, Dr. Oz blogger, and beloved public speaker, reflects on the
          overwhelming challenges that fall into every life, and the renewal
          that comes when we are able to meet them with courage. A funny,
          big-hearted self-help memoir that takes on issues like divorce,
          caregiving, and burnout—and many women’s biggest enemies of all, fear,
          insecurity, and self-doubt—<i>Falling Together</i> shows how to turn
          the challenges that threaten to knock us to the ground into the
          building blocks we need to become more successful, more joyful, and
          ultimately, more alive.

          “Donna Cardillo shares her personal journey, and the lessons she’s
          learned along the way, authentically and generously. This book will
          inspire women to practice self-reflection and self-care to discover
          the profound opportunities and lessons their own lives hold for them
          too.”<br />
          —Michelle May, M.D., author of
          <i>Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat</i> <br /><br />
          “In this beautiful book, Donna inspires us by telling her life stories
          of struggle and finding herself, through both common and uncommon
          journeys of life. Every reader will find moments in the book that
          their hearts and minds can not only relate to, but feel empowered by
          hearing Donna's ability to navigate and overcome with grace. The
          lessons learned at the back of each chapter are particularly
          inspiring, you will find a gem in each lesson. Definitely a book for
          every woman.”<br />
          —Dianne Maroney, RN, MSN; author; founder of The Imagine Project
          <br /><br />
          “I was most touched by the sheer resiliency and determination that is
          at the heart of Donna Cardillo’s life story. No matter what life
          catapulted her way, she found a way to use her own resources, and
          those of others, to get through. Even better, the lessons she learned
          from each challenge embedded themselves within her and moved her
          successfully forward. Highly recommended for any woman looking to find
          her way in this journey we call life.”<br />
          —Flo Schell, EdM; founder: Perceptive Coaching Systems; visionary
          artist <br /><br />
          “Donna Cardillo has written a primer on how to come back to yourself
          after losing your way, recreate your joy and creativity, and learn to
          nurture your body and soul. A powerful and beautifully written book,
          Falling Together will inspire all who read it.”<br />

          >
          <br /><br />
          “Cardillo masterfully shares her own story and experiences of others
          to prove that even the darkest moments can lead to transformational
          change, renewal, and rebirth at any age. This funny, heartwarming,
          uplifting, easy read is for anyone who wants to embrace life with
          greater self-awareness, confidence, happiness, and peace.”<br />

          “The future belongs to those who integrate mind, body, and spirit, and
          the world is hungry for the information in Falling Together. You
          cannot heal what you cannot feel, and Cardillo’s book brings together
          intellectual, emotional, and physical healing.”<br />
