            chronicle of a scientist and humanitarian on a journey of discovery
            into the mysteries of death and what comes after . . . [a] lovely

          ><b>—</b><b>&nbsp;#1 </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b
          >&nbsp;<b>bestselling author </b><br /><br /><br />
          In the groundbreaking book, Dr. John Lerma shares his valuable
          research on pre-death hallucinations from the countless terminally ill
          patients he lovingly cares for as a doctor and director at The Medical
          Center of Houston, Texas. Sixteen inspirational stories chronicle
          children and adults confronting their deaths through the comforting
          visions of divine beings. By presenting these mysterious visions,
          synchronicities, and angelic conversations his patients encounter, Dr.
          Lerma shows how knowledge of death can ease the pain and fear as we
          prepare to enter into the light.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In this book you will learn: the exhilarating and calming elements of
          pre-death experiences; healing during the dying process; the
          difference between hallucinations and visions; and self-forgiveness
          and self-love as the key to a joyous life and a peaceful transition.
          The mystical experiences described here delve into the creation of the
          universe, past and future extinctions, dark angels and white angels,
          selfless suffering and its effect on humanity, free will as the vital
          ingredient to create on earth and in heaven, and many more incredible
          revelations. The poignant stories in <i>Into the Light </i>will leave
          you feeling uplifted in faith, hope, and love.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Finally, a science-minded physician has addressed the phenomenon of
          pre-death experiences with compassion, comprehension, and candor . . .
          you will be uplifted and inspired by this book.”—Gary E. Schwartz,
          PhD, professor of psychology and medicine at the University of Arizona
          and author of&nbsp;<i>Super Synchronicity</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          John Lerma, M.D., currently serves as a consultant for several
          hospices and palliative units in Houston and San Antonio, Texas. He is
          widely known for his compassionate and loving care of hundreds of
          terminally ill patients, as well as his tenure as the inpatient
          medical director for the internationally renowned Medical Center
          Hospice of Houston, Texas. Because the inpatient unit is located in
          the heart of the largest medical center in the world, he has worked
          closely with MD Anderson Hospital, the leading cancer institute in the
          world in research and teaching. After obtaining a degree in pharmacy
          at the University of Texas at Austin, he entered medical school at the
          University of Texas San Antonio and, years later, finished his
          training in internal medicine. Over the last 10 years he has focused
          his career in the field of hospice and palliative medicine.
          Board-certified in internal medicine as well as hospice and palliative
          medicine, Dr. Lerma is recognized for his compassionate care of
          hospice and palliative patients as well as research in the field of
          pre-death experiences. While working at the Medical Center in Houston,
          he was involved with teaching hospice and palliative medicine to
          medical students, residents, and geriatric, oncology and palliative
          fellows from several institutions. As an international speaker, Dr.
          Lerma is recognized for his signature lecture, ''Pre-Death
          Experiences: A Hospice Physician's Perspective on Spirituality and the
          Terminally Ill.'' He is a frequent guest of local, national, and
          international media. Dr. Lerma is creating a non-profit company titled
          Hearts without Borders, which will take the hospice concept to
          underserved areas in South America. His organization's current project
          is to organize a hospice team and travel to several Mexican and South
          American cities to aid governments and physicians in giving birth to
          the wonderful gift of hospice.
