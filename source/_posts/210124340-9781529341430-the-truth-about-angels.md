            ><b>is the one book you need to discover the angels within. </b
            ><br /><br />
            With the world in turmoil, spiritual forces are needed more than
            ever before. Harnessing the angel and new age movement can help you
            make sense of life when it feels directionless. Angels provide us
            with hope and illuminate a new path forward. They are appearing with
            more frequency and intensity in both our daily lives and our dreams
            as they're wanting us to see, hear and know them because,
            consciously or unconsciously, we have collectively been asking for
            them.<br /><br />Rather than visiting or becoming dependent on
            gurus, psychics or mediums, expert Theresa Cheung is here to show
            you how to directly communicate with angels on your own. Divided
            into three parts - <i>The Secret World of Angels</i>,
            <i>The Secret Language of Angels</i> and
            <i>Angels and Miracles</i> - Theresa Cheung's much-anticipated book
            will teach you everything you need to know, including how to decode
            the secret language they speak to us in, how to look within - rather
            than externally - to find angels, as well as sharing real-life
            anecdotes on how angels have changed the lives of people all over
            the world. <br /><br />In <i>The Truth about Angels</i> Theresa will
            also share her own spiritual story; her book is based on decades of
            research, personal experience, and is underpinned by science.<br /><br />

        <p>
          Theresa Cheung is a rare, authentic light in this world. In her latest
          book <i>The Truth About Angels,</i> she offers a unique approach to
          our celestial guardians, stretching our curiosity beyond the mystical
          and into the realms of the scientific. For anyone who has had an
          angelic intervention, they will know first-hand how difficult it can
          be to quantify their experiences or relay their account to others
          without feeling challenged or ridiculed. In a world full of naysayers
          and skeptics, Theresa is helping to steer us on a new course. She not
          only offers support and understanding to those with the gift of inner
          sight, but also helps the non-believer to come to terms with the
          existence of the paranormal and non-corporeal with down-to-earth
          explanations that are backed by science. This is a book any mystic or
          healer could gift to their friends and family to help them see the
          world from a more magical perspective - in a way that feels safe and
          reassuring.
