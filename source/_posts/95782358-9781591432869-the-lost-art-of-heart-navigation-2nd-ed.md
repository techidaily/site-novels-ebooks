          Discover your soul’s purpose by following the shamanic path of the
          heart <br /><br />• Explains how to engage your heart’s navigational
          guidance system to access your spiritual core directly and find your
          life purpose and spiritual identity <br /><br />• Includes shamanic
          practices to meet your power animals, consult with spirit guides,
          embark on journeys in the spirit world, slay your inner dragons of
          self-sabotage and fear, clear emotional wounding patterns, and find
          your personal spirit song <br /><br />• Offers case studies and
          troubleshooting help for common pitfalls and obstacles on the
          heart-centered shamanic path <br /><br />• Includes access to 4 guided
          audio journeys narrated by the author <br /><br />Each of us has a
          vision for our lives, our soul’s purpose awaiting release in our
          hearts. The most important task we have is to learn what that purpose
          is and then bring it into the world. In our world of endless busyness
          and “hurry sickness,” many people are experiencing soul loss as they
          live out dreams of endless motion, empty tasks, anxiety, and negative
          thoughts. But you can change your world and discover the shamanic
          heart path that activates your wildness, your power, and your soul’s
          purpose. <br /><br />Blending earth-honoring shamanic practices and
          modern depth psychology, Jeff Nixa explains how to practice the lost
          art of heart navigation to help you find your life purpose and
          spiritual identity, conquer the fear, doubt and criticism that stand
          in the way of that vision, and become a shamanic shapeshifter of your
          life. Providing heart-opening exercises to slow your mental racing and
          detect your heart’s navigational guidance system, he shows how to
          awaken your wild and free heart, access your spiritual core directly,
          deactivate trauma-based emotional patterns, retrieve vital energy,
          work with your dreams, and become an artist of the soul. You will
          learn how to meet your power animals and consult with spirit guides,
          embark on shamanic journeys in the spirit world for help and
          information, slay your inner dragons of self-sabotage, find your
          personal spirit song, and create the joyful life that your heart is
          attuned to seek out. <br /><br />Offering case studies and
          troubleshooting help for common pitfalls and obstacles on the
          heart-centered path, this shamanic manual provides hands-on practices
          and ceremonies--including access to 4 guided audio journeys narrated
          by the author--as well as wisdom from the author’s own journey and the
          powerful teachers he has worked with, including Sandra Ingerman,
          Mikkal, spiritual elders of the Oglala Lakota people, and plant-spirit
          medicine shamans of the Amazon jungle. Allowing you to understand the
          precise contours of your authentic self and your visionary heart, this
          book offers a map to a vibrant new life aligned with your soul and
          deepest calling.
