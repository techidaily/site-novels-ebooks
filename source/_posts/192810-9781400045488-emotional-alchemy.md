          Alchemists sought to transform lead into gold. In the same way, says
          Tara Bennett-Goleman, we all have the natural ability to turn our
          moments of confusion or emotional pain into insightful clarity.<br /><br /><i
            >Emotional Alchemy</i
          >
          maps the mind and shows how, according to recent advances in cognitive
          therapy, most of what troubles us falls into ten basic emotional
          patterns, including fear of abandonment, social exclusion (the feeling
          we don't belong), and vulnerability (the feeling that some catastrophe
          will occur). Through the simple practice of mindfulness taught in this
          book, we can free ourselves of such patterns and replace them with
          empathy for ourselves and others, as well as the freedom to be more
          creative and alive.<br /><br />You'll find the very latest research in
          neuroscience--including the neurological "magic quarter second,"
          during which it is possible for a thought to be "caught" before it
          turns into an emotional reaction. And you'll discover the fascinating
          parallels of this science with the wisdom of ancient Buddhism--for
          Buddhists knew centuries ago that we can end our self-destructive
          habits.<br /><br />This remarkable book also teaches the practice of
          mindfulness, an awareness that lets us see things as they truly are
          without distortion or judgment, giving the most insightful explanation
          of how mindfulness can change not only our lives, but the very
          structure of our brains. Here is a beautifully rendered work full of
          Buddhist wisdom and stories of how people have used mindfulness to
          conquer their self-defeating habits. The result is a whole new way of
          approaching our relationships, work, and internal lives.

          "A wonderfully clear, compassionate, and insightful guide to freeing
          ourselves from difficult emotions."<br />-- Sharon Salzberg, author of
          <i>Lovingkindness</i><br /><br />"A wonderfully wise book, one that is
          down to earth and immensely practical. I know I will be using it as a
          resource in my own life for a long time."<br />-- Susan Griffin,
          author of <i>A Chorus of Stones</i> and <i>What Her Body Thought</i
          ><br /><br />"May this very important and enticing book find its way
          into the hearts of readers near and far so that it can perform its
          mysterious and healing alchemy for the benefit of all. Tara
          Bennett-Goleman has done a great service in describing in such
          inspiring and precise ways how meditative practices can liberate us
          from the patterns of emotional reactions that, unexamined, lead
          invariably to suffering and harm." <br />-- Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of
          <i>Wherever You Go There You Are</i> and professor of medicine at
          University of Massachusetts Medical School<br /><br />"A rare
          accomplishment, bringing the synthesis of Western psychology and
          Buddhist mindfulness practice to an entirely new level. Much more than
          theory, it is a wise and pragmatic guide to emotional freedom. Tara
          Bennett-Goleman weaves together with consummate skill the wisdom
          teachings of the East, the latest understandings of cognitive therapy
          and neuroscience, and the innumerable personal stories that bring all
          of it to life." <br />-- Joseph Goldstein, author of
          <i>Insight Meditation</i><br /><br />"Gliding effortlessly from
          personal reminiscence to the latest in neuroscience, from meditation
          instruction to the intricacies of cognitive therapy, Tara
          Bennett-Goleman invites us to be part of her journey. In showing us
          how to use our minds to heal our emotions, she heals our minds with
          her heart."<br />-- Mark Epstein, M.D., author of
          <i>Thoughts Without a Thinker</i> and
          <i>Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart</i><br /><br />"A very
          accessible and practical guide to transforming emotions. If you wish
          to know how your emotional habits can be changed, this book is for
          you." <br />-- Richard J. Davidson, director, Wisconsin Center for
          Affective Science and W. M. Keck Laboratory for Functional Brain
          Imaging and Behavior, University of Wisconsin<br /><br />"A beautiful
          blend of spiritual wisdom and psychological insight. Based on many
          years of intensive meditation and experience as a practicing
          psychotherapist, the author offers guidance that is relevant for
          anyone who wishes to be free from suffering or to help others on the
          way. This book is an engaging invitation to bring the art of
          mindfulness to emotional transformation and well-being."<br />--
          Frances Vaughan, author of <i>Shadows of the Sacred</i><br /><br />"<i
            >Emotional Alchemy</i
          >
          is an amazing feast of knowledge of East and West, traditional and
          current. It shows how everyday emotions can be transmuted as a means
          of healing. All the principles of the alchemy of mind explained in one
          book -- a must-read handbook." <br />-- Tulku Thondup, author of
          <i>Healing and the Mind</i><br /><br />"Written with humor,
          warmheartedness in lively prose . . . a landmark step forward for us
          all."<br />-- Naomi Wolf, author of <i>The Beauty Myth</i>
