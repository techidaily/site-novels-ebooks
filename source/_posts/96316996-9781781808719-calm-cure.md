          'Imagine our planet free of war. Imagine your life free of conflict.
          World peace is possible through inner peace in each of us. I am deeply
          inspired by Sandy Newbigging’s pioneering work with Mind Calm, Body
          Calm and now Calm Cure.’&nbsp;<br /><b>Robert Holden</b>,
          author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Shift&nbsp;Happens!&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i
            >Happiness&nbsp;Now!</i
          ><br /><br />‘<i>Calm Cure</i>&nbsp;is a beautiful oasis of relief for
          the restless and frustrated mind, as it brings about resolution to the
          hidden conflicts that keep us from living in harmony, happiness and
          peace. Reading it is a gift to your spirit and will lead you to
          creating all that your heart truly desires.’&nbsp;<br /><b

          >, author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Your 3 Best Super&nbsp;Powers</i
          ><br /><br />‘Sandy shows that once we remove our inner conflict we
          are better able to have great relationships, success in our careers,
          an abundance of money, more time and even impact the wider world in a
          more honest, real and powerful way. I wholeheartedly recommend this
          book!’<br /><b>David Hamilton</b>, author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i
            >How Your Mind Can&nbsp;Heal Your Body</i
          ><br /><br />‘In today’s changing world this is a must-read for those
          committed to living a peaceful, grounded life.’<br /><b

          >, author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Light is&nbsp;the&nbsp;New Black&nbsp;</i
          >and&nbsp;<i>Rise Sister&nbsp;Rise</i><br /><br />‘Sandy encourages us
          to stop fighting ourselves and to stop fighting life. The inner peace
          that this leads to will manifest as outer peace in both our physical
          bodies and the wider world. What could be more relevant nowadays than
          that?’<br /><b>Charlie&nbsp;Morley</b>, author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i
            >Dreams&nbsp;of&nbsp;Awakening<br /></i
          ><br />‘<i>Calm Cure</i>&nbsp;introduces you to exceptional tools to

          ><br /><br />‘Sandy does it again, but more deeply and profoundly than
          ever before. This book gets to the heart of the matter and allows you
          to go deeper into your true natural state of beingness, and becoming
          free of emotional and physical conflict. Thank you, Sandy, for sharing
          your profound knowledge; the world needs to read this book!’<br /><b

            >Calm Cure</i
          >&nbsp;guides us to release what we are convinced that we want in
          order to receive so much more of what we actually need. There’s an
          abundance and a flow that wants to move through us and inform our
          actions, and Sandy shows us the way to unlock it.’<br /><b
            >Meggan Watterson</b
          >, author&nbsp;of<i>&nbsp;Reveal&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i
            >How&nbsp;to&nbsp;Love Yourself</i
          ><br /><br />‘I love the shift that Sandy talks about in&nbsp;<i
            >Calm Cure</i
          >, moving from the “fix it” perspective to the “peace with”
          perspective. Most of the stress we experience is around the pressure
          we put on ourselves to control or change a situation. Sandy’s
          technique is straightforward and his outlook on life is soothing. The
          world needs more calm – and this could be the book to help you get
          there.’<br /><b>Abby Wynne</b>, author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i

          ><br /><br />‘What I love about Sandy is his passion and commitment to
          helping others heal and reconnect to who they truly are. With&nbsp;<i
            >Calm Cure</i
          >, Sandy has done it again – he has poured his heart and soul into
          writing this book and I’m excited for everyone who picks it up and
          follows his process.’<br /><b>Brett&nbsp;Moran</b>,
