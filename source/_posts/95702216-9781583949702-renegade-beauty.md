            established regimes and commercial products, and embrace your
            “renegade” beauty</b
          ><br /><br />In this essential full-color guide, Nadine Artemis
          introduces readers to the concept of "renegade" beauty—a practice of
          doing less and allowing the elements and the life force of nature to
          revive the body, skin, and soul so our natural radiance can shine
          through. Anyone stuck in perpetual loops of new products, facials, and
          dermatologist appointments will find answers as Artemis illuminates
          the energizing elements of sun, fresh air, water, the earth, and
          plants. This book is a comprehensive resource for anyone who wants to
          simplify their self-care routine, take their health into their own
          hands, and discover their own radiant beauty.

          “More than simply a beauty book, this is one of the most comprehensive
          guides to the new paradigm of health and medicine including essential
          myth-busting and evidence-based tips for true health and wellness.
          This book has soared to the top of my list for awakened vitality and
          self-healing.”<br />
          —Kelly Brogan, MD, holistic psychiatrist and author of the
          <i>NY Times</i> best seller <i>A Mind of Your Own</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Nadine Artemis has been my essential oil mentor since I was 19 years
          old.<br />
          She is a savant alchemist whose teachings are on the front lines of
          the self-care movement. I recommend her products and her teachings of
          profound visionary service to any and all.”<br />
          —Alanis Morissette<br /><br />“Nature has always been my teacher, so
          to turn to her divine intelligence as the source of my healing,
          renewed potency, and sustained power simply makes sense. Thank you,
          Nadine, for generously sharing your life’s passion with us.”<br />
          —Lisa&nbsp;Bonet ~ Lilakoi Moon<br />&nbsp;<br />
          “Simply reading <i>Renegade Beauty</i> made me feel more beautiful.
          Nadine’s scientific and poetic style equals the lavish abundance of
          nature that she extols to restore. I loved reading about beauty from
          Nadine’s perspective.”<br />
          —Carol Alt, health advocate, actress, Fox News host, supermodel, and
          author of <i>A Healthy You</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Finally! The truth about beauty and skincare. This book will
          positively impact the future generations of young girls and women who
          are becoming aware earlier and younger in their lives of the emphasis
          society places on appearance and beauty. Nadine’s knowledge about the
          body and what TRULY creates beauty will be a relief for women
          everywhere. They will be armed with knowledge of what to avoid and
          what to embrace with the poetic beauty that springs forth from this
          magical woman’s heart.”<br />
          —Muneeza Ahmed, medical intuitive and nutrition and emotional wellness
          coach<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Renegade Beauty </i>melted me into the revelation that my body
          will heal—and beautify—if I stop short-circuiting its power with
          chemicals and quick fixes. The beauty industry is a disempowering (and
          toxic) industry. Nadine’s type of knowledge is the lotion and potion
          we need to apply.”<br />
          —Danielle Laporte, author of <i>The Desire Map </i>and
          <i>White Hot Truth</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Renegade Beauty </i>poetically demonstrates Nadine’s devotion to
          glorifying true beauty—our inner beauty—and explores the ways we can
          harmonize with nature’s healing gifts and natural rhythms. A beautiful
          and unique book that offers far more than the beauty routine you might
          expect!”<br />
          —Anthony William, author of
          <i>Medical Medium: Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness </i>and
          <i>How to Finally Heal</i>
