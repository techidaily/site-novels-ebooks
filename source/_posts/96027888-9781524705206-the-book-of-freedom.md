            >The third work in channeler Paul Selig's acclaimed Mastery Trilogy
            guides readers to the knowledge of their true selves.</b
          ><br /><br />"The crown jewel of the mastery trilogy--<b
            >the most important spiritual work of our time</b
          >."--Aubrey Marcus, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
          <i>Own the Day, Own Your Life</i>, founder and CEO of Onnit<br /><br />The
          channeled literature of Paul Selig--who receives clairaudient
          dictation from unseen intellects called the Guides--has quickly become
          the most important and celebrated expression of channeling since
          <i>A Course In Miracles</i> rose to prominence in the 1970s.<br /><br />Selig's
          previous trilogy of channeled wisdom--<i
            >I Am the Word, The Book of Love and Creation</i
          >, and<i> The Book of Knowing and Worth</i>--won a large following
          around the world for its depth, intimacy, and psychological insight.
          The first two books of his new Mastery Trilogy,
          <i>The Book of Mastery</i> and <i>The Book of Truth</i>, likewise
          attained popularity and praise. Now, Selig continues the "Teachings of
          Mastery" with the widely anticipated third volume in the series:<i>
            The Book of Freedom</i
          >, which shows readers how to find full expression as the Divine Self
          through surrender and acquiescence to the true nature of their being.

          “The words spoken through Paul Selig in the
          <i>Book of Freedom</i> ring as true as any that have ever been
          written. Like a steady drumbeat drawing us toward our soul’s highest
          potential, this book is the crown jewel of the mastery trilogy—the
          most important spiritual work of our time. The message continues to
          unfold in a way that is deeply impactful for both a first time reader,
          or a long time follower of Paul’s work.&nbsp;The Book of Freedom has
          profoundly influenced my life and I am honored to help shout from the
          rooftops, ’we are free, we are free, we are free!’”—<b
            >Aubrey Marcus</b
          >, founder and CEO of Onnit, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author
          of <i>Own the Day, Own Your Life</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “If you have not yet encountered the channeled teachings of Paul
          Selig, you are in for a treat. Rarely does one encounter spiritual
          teachings of such directness, lucidity, and relevance. In a world
          where there are many claims of higher consciousness and psychic
          insight, Paul is a profound and authentic voice. The teachings of the
          Guides ring true again and again. If you already know something of
          these teachings, you will find here a new wealth of insight into the
          stages of self-understanding that make it possible to live more fully
          from our awake and compassionate core. The <i>Book of Freedom</i> is a
          powerful manual on how to ‘walk the talk’ of authentic spiritual
          teaching—integrating our spiritual selves with our lived human lives.
          This a very welcome addition to the literature of work on
          consciousness.”—<b>Russ Hudson</b>, co-author of
          <i>The Wisdom of the Enneagram</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "The <i>Book of Freedom</i> calls us all into the same kingdom of
          heaven Jesus announced two thousand years ago—experienced through a
          radical shift in perception beyond the known world of judgment and
          prescription into the resonance of divinity in all. Finding freedom
          from the prisons that hold us captive to fear and unworthiness is like
          being re-born into a whole new world at the cost of everything we
          think about ourselves and the nature of reality. This awakening is the
          only journey that ultimately matters, and the
          <i>Book of Freedom</i> is a trumpet that guides us home. May we all
          have ears to hear the song of freedom sung to us in this beautiful
          offering of love."—<b>Ted Dekker</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Rise of the Mystics</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />Praise for the Mastery Trilogy<br /><br />
          "Paul's messages arrive from a consortium of unseen ‘Guides’ whose
          voices are deeply ethical, penetratingly&nbsp;insightful regarding the
          foibles of human nature, and unsparingly blunt about the
          possibilities&nbsp;and pitfalls facing us in the present era. &nbsp;As
          an intellect, Paul, too, possesses these qualities and serves as a
          fine&nbsp;instrument—a kind of Stradivarius of the soul—through which
          the Guides can play their notes."—<b>Mitch Horowitz</b>, PEN
          Award-winning author of <i>Occult America</i>,
          <i>One Simple Idea </i>and <i>The Miracle Club</i>
