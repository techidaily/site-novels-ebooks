            Finding herself in the throes of despair after the death of her
            husband Charlie, Myrna Skoller finally reaches out to her inner
            teacher, who she also identifies as Jesus, to help her heal. By
            using the keyboard and letters as a means of communication, she
            opens up the channels to a unique form of discussion. As her pain
            from depression is revealed, the begins to discover comfort and
            healing through their dialogues. Along the journey, Charlie's
            character also takes on a significant role because of recurring
            instances of unusual phenomenon, one of which she refers to as
            "heart light."<strong> Letters to Heaven and Back</strong
            >&nbsp;candidly illustrates that any form of self-expression which
            is fueled by a desire to heal can lead to healing.

            This book is an antecedent story to Skoller's more recently
            published book, <strong>Private Lessons With Jesus.</strong> After
            having been a student of A Course in Miracles for over thirty years,
            Myrna Skoller discovered her own true and personal relationship with
            Jesus, just because she asked. She embarked upon a 365-day journey
            with Jesus into ACIM lessons, wanting to know what Jesus Himself
            expected her to learn from Him personally. Because she was
            discovering what an amazing voyage into the "Self" this was
            becoming, she decided to journalize each lesson. At first, she
            thought that the lessons were meant for her alone. However, only by
            recognizing the amazing impact they were having on her did she
            realize that the messages contained within those teachings would
            also have widespread appeal as well.
