          How our unconscious minds connect with our families through dreams<br /><br />•
          Shows how the connected dreamlife of families reveals itself in
          nightmares and unusual dreams, during critical times such as
          pregnancy, conflicts, and medical emergencies, and in shared,
          telepathic, and precognitive dreams<br /><br />• Explains how
          dreamwork can help heal our psychospiritual selves and aid in both
          family and couples therapy<br /><br />• Examines ancient dream
          traditions from Africa, Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, and
          the ancient Egyptian Mystery Schools<br /><br />Our dreams, the most
          intimate part of us, form the truest expressions of our feelings and
          emotional beliefs about the world. Our dreams also reflect the complex
          connections of our unconscious minds with those of our families and
          close friends, connecting us through our dreams to loved ones near and
          far, living and passed on.<br /><br />Integrating traditional dream
          analysis with family psychology, clinical science, and parapsychology,
          Edward Bruce Bynum, Ph.D., ABPP, details how our personal unconscious
          is interwoven into our larger family unconscious. He shows how these
          dreamlife connections and patterns are as old as humanity itself,
          exploring ancient dream traditions from around the world. He explains
          how the dreamlife of a family can be viewed as a shared field or
          hologram, where each family member is enfolded into the dreams of the
          other members. This shared reality reveals itself in family and
          personal illnesses, in nightmares and unusual dreams, and during
          critical times such as crisis, pregnancy, conflicts, and medical
          emergencies. It also reveals itself in cases of simultaneous shared
          dreams and telepathic and precognitive dreams, explaining why so many
          people have dreams in which a family member appears to say good-bye,
          waking the next day to discover the same loved one has passed away.
          Sharing clinical case studies from his Family Dream Research Project,
          the author shows how the intimate labyrinth of our dream lives is
          always flowing beneath the surface of our waking lives, shaping and
          influencing our relationships and our deep core experiences. He
          reveals how dreams can be healing factors as well as diagnostic
          signals, detailing how dreamwork can aid in both family and couples
          therapy.<br /><br />Showing how our family’s dreamlife connects us to
          our ancestors and weaves us into the messages we send to our
          children’s children, the author offers an opportunity to identify
          personal and family patterns, heal our psychospiritual selves, and
          grow our understanding of our own minds.

        <p>
          “Healthy families dream together. This is the essential good sense of
          <i>The Dreamlife of Families</i>, which carefully amasses evidence
          that family members dream of each other and <i>for</i> each other and
          may have shared adventures in deeper realities accessible in dreaming.
          He helps us recognize the vital function of ‘crisis telepathy,’ in
          which we receive alerts about emergency situations that prepare us to
          handle them and sometimes to contain them. Bynum grounds his study of
          family dreams in an understanding of the vital role of dreaming in
          human evolution. He gives us the science of the dreaming brain while
          recognizing that the brain is within the mind. He encourages us to
          expand our understanding and practice to aspire to the continuity of
          consciousness called Yoga Nidra in the East. I recommend this wise and
          heartening book.”
