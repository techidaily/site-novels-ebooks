              >The bestselling authors of <i>Energy Medicine</i> and
              <i>Energy Medicine for Women</i> present a complete program for
              using energy medicine to heal and strengthen romantic
              relationships.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />A relationship begins with the meeting of two unique
          energies. This union of energies, though invisible, determines the way
          you communicate, fight, love, and want to be loved. In this
          groundbreaking book, the bestselling authors of
          <i>Energy Medicine </i>draw on the real-life experiences of couples
          who have attended their popular “Energies of Love” workshops, as well
          as their own experience as husband and wife, to show how an
          understanding of your energy system and that of your partner can help
          you build a more harmonious and loving bond.<br /><br />We all have
          different ways of making sense of the world around us, but when faced
          with conflict, especially with those we care most about, we tend to
          revert to one of four “Energetic Stress Styles”:<br /><br />- Visuals
          are extremely passionate and inspire others to care about the things
          they care about, but in moments of conflict, their take on the
          situation can overshadow what is actually occurring, undermining their
          ability to empathize with their partner.<br />- Kinesthetics are
          generous, compassionate, and accepting of other people, but their
          caring nature pulls them in too many directions. They try to meet
          others’ needs at the expense of their own, which can cause mounting
          resentment.<br />- Digitals are rational and principled and have a
          gift for quickly understanding complex situations, but they can become
          closed to others’ perspectives and feelings.<br />- Tonals have a gift
          for understanding others and their dilemmas, but during moments of
          conflict, their ability to read between the lines can morph into
          hearing what was never said, felt, or thought.
          <p>
            According to the authors, the strongest relationships are those in
            which the two parties feel that they are partners on a shared
            spiritual journey. By helping you better understand your own unique
            energy system, as well as that of your partner, you will be able to
            recognize your strengths as a couple-¬and avoid the pitfalls.
            <i>The Energies of Love </i>serves as a powerful resource for anyone
            who wishes to build a rich partnership while maintaining&nbsp; the
            spark that keeps a relationship exciting.

          actually resides. This is an important book for all those who want to
          take their relationship to the next level.”<br /><b

          can find it in this remarkable book. If this tattered world of ours is
          going to survive, it will be through the energies of love. Donna Eden
