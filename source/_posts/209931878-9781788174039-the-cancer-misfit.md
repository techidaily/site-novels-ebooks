          <b>You've survived cancer treatment - now what?</b
          ><i
            ><br /><br />
            The Cancer Misfit</i
          >
          is here to support you when doctors, friends and family have gone
          'back to normal' and assumed you can do the same. It's a life raft to
          help you navigate life after cancer treatment; to help you live
          better, think better and feel better and show you how to embrace your
          new future.<br /><br />
          After the treatment stops it can be difficult to know how to move on,
          and many survivors feel stuck in limbo between who they used to be
          before the diagnosis and who they are today. This is how Saskia felt
          when she was told the treatment was over: she felt like a Cancer
          Misfit, recovered physically, but mentally and emotionally still
          healing. Now, Saskia shares the tools that enabled her to become the
          happiest version of herself she has ever known.<br /><br />
          In these pages, you'll find the truth - that your best life and most
          beautiful self was not the person you were before your cancer
          diagnosis, but the person you are today; that you've become even more
          powerful because of the hell you went through, and that the greatest
          chapter of your life is here and now.<br /><br />
          <i>The Cancer Misfit</i> will introduce you to the person you've
          become as a consequence of the trauma you endured and help you to
          embrace your new life after treatment; a life full of confidence,
          happiness and peace.

          inspirational speaker, and wellbeing &amp; happiness coach who is on a
          mission to show the world how to get happy and stay happy. It took a

          known. She is now a qualified integrated life coach and counsellor as
          well as an all-round happiness and self-love ninja. She can usually be
