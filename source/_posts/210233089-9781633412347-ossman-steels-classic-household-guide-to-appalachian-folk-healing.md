            >A long-treasured but forgotten classic of folk healing, with an
            introduction and commentary by the author of

            >Ossman &amp; Steel’s Guide to Health or Household Instructor</i
          >
          (its original title) is a collection of spells, remedies, and charms.
          The book draws from the old Pennsylvania Dutch and German powwow
          healing practices that in turn helped shape Appalachian folk healing,
          conjure, rootwork, and many folk healing traditions in America. Jake
          Richards, author of <i>Backwoods Witchcraft</i> and
          <i>Doctoring the Devil</i>, puts these remedies in context, with
          practical advice for modern-day “backwoods” healers interested to use
          them today.<br /><br />
          The first part contains spells and charms for healing wounds, styes,
          broken bones, maladies, and illnesses of all sorts. The second part
          includes other folk remedies using ingredients based on sympathetic
          reasoning, including sulfuric acid, gunpowder, or other substances for
          swelling, toothache, headache, and so on. These remedies are presented
          here for historic interest, to help better understand how folk
          medicine evolved in America.<br /><br />
          It is Jake Richard’s hope that reintroducing this work will
          reestablish its position as a useful household helper in the library
          of every witch or country healer.

          “Jake Richards’ annotated edition of ‘Ossman &amp; Steel’s Guide to
          Health’ provides the rare opportunity to explore a scarce and
          culturally-significant work on the ritual healing traditions of the
          Pennsylvania Dutch, which were influential throughout Appalachia. In
          the reverent voice of a contemporary practitioner, Richards guides
          readers through this classic healing manual, offering explanations and
          insights into the inner workings of this folk tradition. ‘Ossman &amp;
          Steel’s Guide to Health’ is also the only known historical work of
          Pennsylvania Dutch ritual healing written by a mother and son, Ann
          Ossman and Isaac Steel, underscoring the traditional wisdom in valuing
          the contributions of both genders in the healing arts.”—<b

        <p>
          <b>Jake Richards </b>holds his Appala­chian-Melungeon heritage close
          to his blood and bones. His fam­ily heritage in Appalachia goes back
          generations; they have lived in southwest Virginia, east Ten­nessee,
          and the western Carolinas for a good four hundred years. He spent most
          of his childhood at his great-grandmother’s house on Big Ridge in
          North Carolina, wading the waters of the Watauga and traipsing the
          moun­tains by his ancestral home on the ridge. “My family,” Jake
          writes, “always spoke of the old wives’ tales and folk rem­edies. They
          were mountain people to the bone; hunters, farmers, faith healers,
          preachers, and root-diggers.” Jake has practiced Appalachian folk
          magic for over a decade. Aside from being an author and practitioner,
          Jake is a member of the Melungeon Heritage Association, holds a seat
          on the board of WAM: We Are Melungeons, and is the creator of HOM:
          House of Malungia, Melungeon cultural society. You can find him on
