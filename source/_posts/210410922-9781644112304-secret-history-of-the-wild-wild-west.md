          • Offers evidence from Jesse James’s secret encoded diaries
          <br /><br />• Examines Jesse James’s close ties with other notorious
          outlaws, such as Johnny Ringo, Jesse Evans, and Billy the Kid
          <br /><br />• Shows how Jesse James was related, by blood or marriage,
          to powerful people in law enforcement and politics, including the
          elite families behind the Copperheads and the Knights of the Golden
          Circle organizations <br /><br />Jesse James and many other Old West
          outlaws were much more than just wild cowboys. As author Daniel
          Duke--the great-great-grandson of Jesse James--reveals, Jesse James
          and other infamous outlaws were part of a larger organization,
          centuries old, that has affected U.S. history from the small, rural
          streets of early America to the highest levels of the nation’s
          government, with continuing influence to this day.<br /><br />Drawing
          on his great-great-grandfather’s secret diaries, Duke unravels the
          hidden history of the Wild West to expose the outlaws, politicians,
          and secret societies who were pulling strings behind the scenes. He
          examines Jesse James’s close ties with other notorious outlaws, such
          as Johnny Ringo, Jesse Evans, and Billy the Kid, and demonstrates not
          only how Jesse James faked his own death and lived out his life under
          an alias, but how Billy the Kid did the same. He also details how both
          Jesse James and Billy the Kid continued their work for the nameless
          organization after their faked deaths. <br /><br />Exploring how Jesse
          James was related, by blood or marriage, to powerful people in law
          enforcement and politics, Duke details Jesse’s connections to the
          Baylor family, who founded Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and other
          elite families who were instrumental in founding and leading the
          Copperheads and the Knights of the Golden Circle organizations before,
          during, and after the Civil War. The author shows how Jesse James was
          connected to former U.S. presidents Lyndon Baines Johnson and Harry S.
          Truman as well as President Johnson’s man in the shadows, Texas mob
          figure Billie Sol Estes. <br /><br />Exposing the secret agenda behind
          the outlaw gangs of the Wild West, Duke also reveals the stealthy war
          between the secret organization and its opposition that has been waged
          in the shadows for centuries.
