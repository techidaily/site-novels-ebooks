          The Economy of Enough is more than just another 'self-help' book. In
          fact, it may be the only book you need to read this year. There are
          many books that tell you 'what' to do, but Bronwen tells you how 'YOU'
          can do it! With her insightful 'NUFFdoms' Bronwen walks the reader
          through their own beliefs about how and why it is possible to make
          life altering changes that have the power to centre us in a world that
          is constantly vying for our attention from all directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every desire to create a change in our life originates because of an
          experience, every experience is based on a choice, every choice is
          based on a belief about the outcome. Our experiences (mental,
          physical, emotional, spiritual, health, finances, relationships,
          lifestyle, career, happiness etc. are all based on a belief). So the
          question becomes, 'where do your beliefs about who you are and what
          you're capable of doing, being or having come from and when is enough
          finally enough? This book can help you answer those questions. Nancy

            >I had already read Bronwenâ€™s previous book on perfectionism, and so
            my expectations were high and this book did not disappoint. Using
            her personal experiences, she seems to know exactly what I am
            thinking and feeling. There were so many 'aha' moments throughout
            this book and the steps are so easy to implement. However, this is
            far more than a motivational book, because of the question section
            in each chapter, I felt this could be used as a journal also to
            inspire the reader to make the necessary changes in their lives. The
            Nuffdoms really helped me ask myself the right questions, and give
            me a clear direction. I also thought the analogy of the jigsaw
            puzzle pieces in a box, really described my life. This book will
            help anyone understand what makes them tick, why they make the
            decisions they do and help them discover what they want out of life.
            If you feel lost and in a rut, then I would highly recommend this
            book.&nbsp; Lesley Jones - Readers Favourite Reviewer</strong

            >The Economy of Enough: Unlocking the Secret to Happily Ever After
            by Bronwen Sciortino is a [..] powerful book that offers readers the
            tools they need to trump self-sabotaging thoughts, rise from the
            rubble of self-pity, and embrace the path of genuine happiness. </strong
          ><strong
            >Bronwen Sciortino combines psychological principles with thoughts
            on New Age spirituality to create a road map to happiness for people
            who are negatively driven. The Economy of Enough: Unlocking the
            Secret to Happily Ever After offers a powerful message of hope -
            true happiness is possible and it is available to you. The relaxed
            conversational style of writing will make you feel as if you're
            having a good conversation with a trusted friend. There is a lot of
            wisdom and insight in this book. It's a gift to pass on.

            to navigate some of life's most difficult issues; fear, overwhelming
            feelings, following someone else's life path, and more. Sadly, many
            of us are aware that change is needed, but we are clueless as to how
            to go about initiating such changes. Let the author take you on a
            journey of self-discovery by teaching you how to release others'
            expectations, recreate your world, and become more mindful in your
            day-to-day tasks. Free yourself and embrace the real you!</strong
