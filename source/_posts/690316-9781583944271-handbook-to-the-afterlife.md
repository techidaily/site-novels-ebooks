              >Two seasoned experts with decades of experience working with
              channeled material describe the various stages of life after

            ><br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Just as life itself has different stages of growth and development,
            so does the afterlife. In this useful handbook, authors Pamela Rae
            and Jon Klimo demonstrate how dying and rebirth are, much like life,
            continuous processes. <br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            Beginning with the moment of death itself, progressing through
            different transitional stages, and ending with the return of spirits
            to the physical plane, they define the purposes and pitfalls of each
            stage. They look at the kinds of adjustment problems that occur in
            each phase, and how spirits can be helped to move forward. Questions
            of pain and emotional state at the time of death, karma, and
            reincarnation are sensitively addressed. The book includes practical
            techniques for opening communication with those who have passed on
            to the other side. While of interest to anyone seeking a general
            overview of the subject,&nbsp;<i>Handbook to the Afterlife&nbsp;</i
            >is particularly useful for those dealing with spirits who have not
            moved on, such as ghosts.<br /><br />

          “Jon Klimo and Pamela Heath have done it again—produced a book that is
          so broad in its viewpoints and so deep in its research and narratives
          that it cannot be compared to any other volume that concerns itself
          with the afterlife.… They have combined over 200 years of published
          material on the afterlife and on mediumship with traditions from the
          world's great religious and spiritual teachings.… You get an overview
          here that summarizes human thought and feeling, fear and faith, in a
          style that is utterly fascinating and easy to comprehend. The book
          speaks clearly to all who question: 'What happens to me after I die?'
          An exceptional piece of work.”<br />

          “While of interest to anyone seeking a general overview of the
          subject, <i>Handbook to the Afterlife</i> is particularly useful for
          those dealing with spirits who have not moved on, such as ghosts.”<br />

          <i>A Lawyer Presents the Case for the Afterlife</i><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “This is an excellent book, examining the fascinating subject of the
          afterlife with new knowledge, clearly organized and put forth
          effectively with conclusions that are ultimately inspirational. The
          writing is conversational, pertinent and utterly readable. Highly

          beliefs.”<br />
