          <b>Uncover the secrets of the next life...<br /></b><br />David
          Kessler, one of the most renowned experts on death and grief, takes on
          three uniquely shared experiences that challenge our ability to
          explain and fully understand the mystery of our final days. The first
          is "visions." As the dying lose sight of this world, some people
          appear to be looking into the world to come. The second shared
          experience is getting ready for a "trip." These trips may seem to us
          to be all about leaving, but for the dying, they may be about
          arriving. Finally, the third phenomenon is "crowded rooms." The dying
          often talk about seeing a room full of people, as they constantly
          repeat the word crowded. <br /><br />In truth, we never die alone.
          Just as loving hands greeted us when we were born, so will loving arms
          embrace us when we die. In the tapestry of life and death, we may
          begin to see connections to the past that we missed in life. While
          death may look like a loss to the living, the last hours of a dying
          person may be filled not with emptiness, but rather with fullness.<br /><br />
          In this fascinating book, David brings us stunning stories from the
          bedsides of the dying that will educate, enlighten, and comfort us
          all.

          “David Kessler writes of a world that is rarely talked about, much
          less examined with such sensitivity. His stories reveal dimensions of
          the death experience that are anything but depressing, and at times
          absolutely joyful. In a book filled with intriguing and inspirational
          tales, Kessler makes a compelling argument that death is not the end.”
          -- <b>Marianne Williamson</b>, the
          <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling author of
          <i>The Age of Miracles</i> and <i>A Course in Weight Loss</i
          ><br /><br />“I so remember David Kessler in the old days of The
          Hayride, a support group I started in West Hollywood. He and his work
          were so vital and so heartwarming to our group, who shared those
          frightening moments of crises in the early days of the AIDS epidemic.
          His very presence with those approaching death was like being
          enveloped in a safe, cozy space. No harm could come to you if David
          was around. In fact, I recently asked him to be there when it is my
          time to go. This book shares David’s wisdom and his love, and helps
          all of us who enter unknown waters.” --&nbsp;<b>Louise Hay</b>, the
