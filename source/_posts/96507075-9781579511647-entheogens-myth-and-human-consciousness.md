          ENTHEOGENS, MYTH AND HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS is a much needed accessible
          exploration into the role of psychoactive sacraments - entheogens - in
          religion, mythology, and history, and also includes most treatments of
          the subject focus on modern scientific research, psychotherapy, are
          auto-bibliographic accounts, or are agenda-driven or otherwise naive
          and myopic.<br /><br />A great mystery of altered states of
          consciousness and species development is expanding with new
          archeological and anthropological discoveries. Religious story telling
          (myth) is a timeless journey. Surprisingly it’s not about truth. It’s
          about finding one’s self in the midst of the discovery of the Other.”
          It is the story of what is separate and unknown that creates
          self-consciousness. Our entire life consists ultimately in the
          discovery of the Other,” which gives meaning to the discovery of the
          self. The arts and language are the fossil remnants scattered on our
          path.<br /><br />ENTHEOGENS, MYTH AND HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS discusses
          the influence of psychoactive substances on consciousness, human
          evolution and mystical experiences. It explores how religion,
          mythology, art and culture stem from entheogenic consciousness and why
          it's important to us today.<br /><br />"Entheogens, or psychoactive
          sacraments, have a long, storied history that has played an essential
          role in the evolution of consciousness, mythology, culture, religion,
          art - and even history and politics. ENTHEOGENS, MYTH AND HUMAN
          CONSCIOUSNESS outlines this suppressed - yet seminal - undercurrent of
          history, giving examples of the role of entheogens from the primal
          shamanic religions through, the historical religions, esoteric
          mystical traditions including the Mystery Religions, alchemy and
          Freemasonry, and into contemporary expressions.<br /><br />Authors
          Ruck and Hoffman draw upon decades of research and personal experience
          in discussing the best documented examples of historically important
          entheogenic evidences, various ongoing threads of research and
          speculation to muse upon the 'meaning' of it all..." <br /><br />Our
          hominid ancestors experienced a spiritual wakening at the very dawn of
          consciousness that set them apart from the other creatures of our
          planet. It was a journey to another realm induced by a special food
          that belonged to the gods. This was a plant that was animate with the
          spirit of deity. It was an entheogen. It was the visionary vehicle for
          the trip of the first shaman.<br /><br />The story was told over and
          over again until it achieved the perfect form of a myth. The realm was
          imagined as a topographical place, the outer limit of the cosmos, the
          fiery empyrean, or its geocentric opposite, our own planet Gaia. Myths
          multiplied over time, but they always preserved this primordial
          truth.<br /><br />These myths provide a road map, a scenario, if you
          can read them, for whoever today wants to follow. However, it is not
          an easy journey, and it is also fraught with many dangers, of getting
          lost, of finding no return. Access to the entheogens is now largely
          prohibited or strictly licensed. The restrictions constitute an
          infringement of cognitive freedom, limiting the further evolution of
          human potential into productive creative imagination and experiences
          that lie beyond the normal, the traditional province of shamans, who
          can understand the speech of plants and animals, change shape at will,
          and journey, both physically and in the spirit, to distant exotic
          realms.<br /><br />In addition, religions have staked out territorial
          claims to this realm of spiritual consciousness. They have colonized
          it, identified it with their god, often reserving the access for their
          own elite. Similarly, trade in drugs, both medicinal and illegal, has
          colonized the etheogens, making them only chemicals, rationally
          depriving them of their spirit.<br /><br />ENTHEOGENS, MYTH AND HUMAN
          CONSCIOUSNESS is a guide for the curious that provides a historical
          overview of the role that entheogens have played in the development of
          our unique supremacy as a species and offers also pathways and advice
          for reconnecting with the primordial sources of nature’s power.<br /><br />ENTHEOGENS,
          MYTH AND HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS investigates the role entheogens have
          played in the evolution of humankind’s attempt to define reality in a
          context of metaphysical or theological dimensions. Although other
          botanical intoxicants will be considered (cannabis, daphne, opium,
          Syrian rue, datura, mandrake), none, with the possible exception of
          mandrake, seem to have lent themselves so readily to metaphoric
          personifications, which make this the subject for a course on
          mythology. The source of humankind’s fascination and repulsion for
          fungi, indeed, leads to a fundamental consideration of the
          psychological nature of mankind’s fascination or awareness of what in
          the categorization of religions is termed animism and rituals of
          ecstatic shamanism. In addition, the linking of bread and wine as
          sacramental foods is due to parallel concepts of controlled fungal
          growth as a simulacrum of the cosmos itself. The goal is not so much
          to acquire factual knowledge of this vast subject, but to open up
          pathways for reflection upon the basic nature of human existence and
          consciousness.<br /><br />The narrative is the awesome history of
          discovery and the findings of ancient rituals that meld into
          twentieth-century controversy and criticism of psychedelics. The
          future of humanity and the direction of twenty-first century brain
          science is challenged as well as our sense of social convention.<br /><br />Entheogens
          have been deemed be prohibited controlled substances and as such is an
          infringement of cognitive freedom. Whatever the danger of potential
          abuse, the substance is not the fault, but the user. The hammer is not
          guilty, but the carpenter who misuses it because of deficient
          training. In order to exonerate the executioner in Classical
          antiquity, the axe was brought to trial and found guilty. The
          prohibition has drastically retarded the investigation into the
          therapeutic potential of proscribed drugs, including their efficacy in
          curing addiction. Some of these substances also offer the potential
          for accessing levels of cognition and consciousness beyond the
          ordinary, the traditional provenance of mystics and shamans, like
          bilocation, clairvoyance, and zoomorphism.
