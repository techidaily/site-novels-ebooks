          <p><i>Spell Castings</i> is an eclectic grimoire of magickal ways.</p>
          <p>
            Have you ever lit a pink candle on a Friday night and thought about
            the love you would like to have in your life? Maybe even closed your
            eyes and pictured that perfect person?
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever walked into a room and knew you were not alone and
            said a prayer for protection?
          </p>
          <p>
            Have you ever looked at a telephone, wished it would ring, and it
            did?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have had these or similar experiences, you have put the
            cosmic forces of the universe to work without even realizing it.
            Imagine what would happen if you decided to consciously focus your
            energy, willing these things to happen. Would they?
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Spell Castings</i> is a book of more than one hundred
            easy-to-use, practical spells to help you achieve and accomplish
            your dreams. Every subject is covered, from cleansing the soul to
            the limitless boundaries of love and death.
            <i>Spell Castings</i> can be performed by the experienced Witch or
            Warlock, but are easy enough for the novice. Specific
            procedures—including the use of various supplies needed to cast the
            spells—are completely explained. Also included are charts to guide
            you through the correct moon phases, magickal days and hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Spell Castings</i> is divided into color-coded chapters to help
            you determine which spell you desire to cast. For example, if you
            were looking for a spell to become more psychic or to help you
            perform more intuitive readings, you would look under the purple
            chapter. If you were seeking a money spell or better employment
            spell, you would look under the green chapter. The color-coded index
            will lead you to the areas you are most interested in casting.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you stir the magick—as only a Witch can’the options are
            limitless and the effects can be life changing. All the spells
            within this book are written with the intent to harm none, so brew
            as often as you and your cauldron desire.
