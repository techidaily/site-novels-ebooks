            The Man Who Tapped the Secrets of the Universe (1946) by Glenn Clark
            is a work of biography and philosophy, exploring the life and ideas
            of the versatile artist, writer, and philosopher Walter Russell.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            New Thought writer and professor Glenn Clark (b. 1882, d. 1956) was
            a fervent believer in the power of prayer and the Light of God to
            reveal the secrets of the universe. As he explains in Chapter One:
            We Go Seeking, he had been searching "...for a man who has
            discovered the universal law which lies back of the Sermon on the
            Mount, and who consciously uses that law with full awareness of its
            meaning, and full obedience to its principles." He believed that he
            had found that man in Walter Russell.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Walter Russell (b. 1871, d. 1963) was a man who seemed
            preternaturally adept at everything he wished to try. After being
            removed from school at the age of nine and sent to work at a dry
            goods store, he worked a number of low-paying jobs. But he had
            "absolute faith...that anything can come to one who trusts to the
            unlimited help of the Universal Intelligence that is within so long
            as one works within the law and always gives more to others than
            they expect, and does it cheerfully and courteously."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Throughout his life, he found success as a musician, painter,
            sculptor, writer, ice skater, philosopher, and lecturer. He was
            commissioned to sculpt a 28-figure Mark Twain Memorial just a few
            years after he began sculpting. And in 1943, President Franklin D.
            Roosevelt asked him to sculpt the Four Freedoms Monument. He
            designed several buildings in New York City and invented the
            cooperative ownership model (aka the co-op). And most of these
            pursuits were undertaken with no formal education.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            By the time Clark met with Russell, he had achieved success in his
            artistic, literary, architectural, physical, and even scientific
            pursuits. So when Clark was searching for a man who knew the secrets
            of the universe and was referred to Russell on more than one
            occasion, he knew that he had to meet him.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Large portions of the book, particularly in the chapters We Meet the
            Man, We Meet the Man of Action, and The Five Laws of Success, are
            presented as an interview with Russell, giving us insight into his
            beliefs straight from the source.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "Every successful man or great genius has three particular qualities
            in common," he says. "The most conspicuous of these is that they all
            produce a prodigious amount of work. The second is that they never
            know fatigue. And the third is that their minds grow more brilliant
            as they grow older, instead of less brilliant. Great men's lives
            begin at forty, where the mediocre man's life ends. The genius
            remains an ever-flowing fountain of creative achievement until the
            very last breath he draws."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            At the heart of Russell's philosophy is a belief that every man "has
            consummate genius within him. Some appear to have it more than
            others only because they are aware of it more than others are, and
            the awareness or unawareness of it is what makes each one of them
            into masters or holds them down to mediocrity..."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            To know that we have genius inside of us, and to have absolute faith
            in our inner voice and in the Universe, is to unlock that genius.
            Through the story of Russell's brilliant life and his Five Personal
            Laws of Success (humility, reverence, inspiration, deep purpose, and
            joy), the reader gets a plain-language example of genius-in-action.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            He demonstrated his great energy, lack of fatigue, and "ever-flowing
            fountain" of genius throughout his long life, maintaining his
            creativity until his death in 1963 at the age of 92.
