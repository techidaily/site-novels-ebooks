            >An experienced financial&nbsp;advisor integrates money, psychology,
            and spirituality to&nbsp;offer a gratitude- and awareness-based
            approach for maximizing your net worth—and your self-worth.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Understanding money is crucial in today’s financially driven world.
          However, attaining wealth has more to do with internal motivations and
          experiences than with external circumstances.
          <i>The Abundance Loop</i> reveals what blocks <i>you</i> from
          achieving the prosperity that is your natural birthright. By breaking
          free from a fear-based mind-set, you will learn to cultivate gratitude
          and awareness—and take conscious action to create the life you
          want.<br /><br />
          Juliana Park, a Certified Financial Planner and
          financial&nbsp;advisor&nbsp;for over 13 years with major Wall Street
          firms, offers a step-by-step approach for you to shift from
          <i>scarcity</i> to <i>abundance</i>. Here, she walks you through 30
          practical exercises and shows you how to:<br /><br />
          •&nbsp;Reframe&nbsp;your life through the lens of the Abundance
          Loop—and radically change your relationship with money, with others,
          and with yourself<br />
          •&nbsp;Align your choices with your core values and authentic
          purpose<br />
          •&nbsp;Find financial security and spiritual serenity<br /><br />
          This groundbreaking book will challenge your beliefs about what is
          possible and lead you on a clear path to enrich both your net worth
          and your self-worth.

          Thought Leadership Lab<br /><br />“When I work in the developing world
          on global health challenges, I see how little it takes for people to
          be happy. Juliana’s work to shift people’s mind-set from scarcity to
          abundance is exactly what we need to create increased self-worth and
          happiness in individuals.”<br /><b>— Seema Handu</b>, Ph.D., Chief

          enhancing our understanding of the relationship between personal
          growth and financial security. Juliana Parks invites readers to
          inquire into their fears and misconceptions about prosper-ity, and
          proposes a model of financial development that includes
          self-knowledge, self-empowerment, appreciation of one’s capacities,
          gratefulness, generosity, and living from one’s core values.”<br /><b

          how to achieve financial wealth, but a real examination of what it
          takes to find and achieve personal fulfillment that paves the way for
          abundance. The Abundance Loop is an essential handbook for mastering
          life skills on constructing a well-balanced financial plan from a
          place of high self-worth.”<br /><b>— Mary Lee</b>, account director,
