            important tarot text that will define this decade.” </b

          >is a provocative exploration of the twenty-two cards of the Major
          Arcana that re envisions these archetypes as beacons that illuminate
          the various ways racism takes root both in ourselves and in the world.
          Author Maria Minnis, with compassion and wisdom, shows us how these
          insights can be turned into self-awareness, self-love, and positive
          social action.<br />

            a map that we can take with us on a voyage as we discover our
            personal, subliminal views on race and how we’re impacted. Each card
            of the Major Arcana serves as a waypoint that challenges us to
            rethink our views on racial equity.”</b

          —Rashunda Tramble, from the foreword<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Tarot has always been a powerful guide for introspection and inner
          work, so what better tool to use when we’re ready to do the really
          hard work? Minnis&nbsp;provides actionable exercises in this tarot
          workbook, giving readers a unique, personal understanding of what
          systemic racism is—and what steps we can take to begin to dismantle
          it. This is a book for anyone who has been overwhelmed, outraged, or
          frustrated and asked, “But what can I do?” It is a book for anyone
          ready to look within and do the uncomfortable inner work necessary to
          demolish everyday racism. This book says tarot can be a tool for
          action, one that may offer great satisfaction as well as great
          difficulty, all while pushing you out of your comfort zone.<br />

            >“This book should be on everyone’s bookshelf, not just tarot
            readers. EVERYONE. In <i>Tarot for the Hard Work</i>, author Maria
            Minnis helps awaken us to our truest, bravest, most compassionate
            selves. It’s a luminous work of love. Minnis shines a torch
            illuminating our path toward justice.”</b

          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>Tarot for the Hard Work</i> you’ll explore the Major Arcana to
          uncover how each card highlights both benevolent and shadow aspects of
          each archetype in relation to the different ways that racism shows up
          in our lives. With exercises and thought-provoking recommended reading
          and resources, you will be guided how to use those themes to dismantle
          internalized racism, racism in your relationships, and racism in your
          communities. Journal prompts are provided to help you create your own
          antiracism tool kit. As you move from the Fool to the World card,
          you’ll discover that everything we do ripples beyond us and that there
          are practical ways to use tarot energy to change our actions and our
          world.<br />
