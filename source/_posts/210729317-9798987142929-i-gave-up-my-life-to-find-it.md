            Life can seem overwhelming. All the choices we face on a daily basis
            can weigh us down and make us feel less certain of our direction in
            life. Mired in major struggles from time to time, we come to
            question our innermost dreams and even our very
            selves.&nbsp;Resisting one's true potential means forgetting the
            prospective of how vast and significant the true power of our
            consciousness truly is. By accepting limitations in mind, we learn
            to forget our infinite capacity.

            I Gave Up My Life to Find IT is the Answer to Life. This book
            represents a story of unique expression. It is a personal account of
            identifying and repairing breaks caused by the mind, which cause
            experiences that appear as relationship discord; financial unrest;
            addiction; illness, failure, and discontentment. I Gave Up My Life
            to Find IT could easily be a record of any of us on our way to
            realizing our true potential for love; abundance; harmony; order;
            peace, and joy. One spectacular book that would truly serve
            everybody well every minute of every day.&nbsp;Gaige's book is a
            push back for each of us to "walk our talk".
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Written for anyone that commits to overcoming illness, relationship
            discord, discontent, addiction or lack/financial unrest, I Gave Up
            My Life to Find IT expresses a greater life purpose that stems from
            our own consciousness. What makes this book different than others in
            the genre, Gaige gently guides the reader through repairing the
            breaks caused by mind.

          <p>
            In this new edition, I Gave Up My Life to Find IT, you'll learn
            about Jule's journey and how you can repair the break caused by the
            mind to help in every aspect of your life-money, health,
            relationships, happiness, and in every interaction, you have with
            the world. You'll begin to understand the hidden reasons why things
            happen in your life. You'll be given the opportunity to develop a
            new relationship with the present " You", one that is based on love,
            freedom, respect, and trust with the "Unknown"
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Jule tells of her struggle for several years to find happiness and
            fulfillment. Only after she began looking within for answers did she
            receive a new life that was transformed into a miraculous event. The
            movie shows the successful transition beyond the physical and
            spiritual worlds and shows how much power we all have to change our
            lives if we repair our breaks, optimize our thoughts and actions.
            All of us can realize our potential and improve our lives, the lives
            of our families, and the lives of those around us.&nbsp;
