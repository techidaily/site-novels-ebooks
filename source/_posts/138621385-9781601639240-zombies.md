          <p>
            In the myths, legends, and folklore of many peoples, the returning,
            physical dead play a significant role, whether they are the zombies
            of Haiti or the draugr of Scandinavia. But what are the origins of
            an actual bodily return from the grave? Does it come from something
            deep within our psyche, or is there some truth to it?
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Zombies</i>, Bob Curran explores how some of these beliefs may
            have arisen and the truths that lay behind them, examining myths
            from all around the world and from ancient times including Sumerian,
            Babylonian, Egyptian, and Celtic. Curran traces the evolution of
            belief in the walking cadaver from its early inception in religious
            ideology to the "Resurrections" and cataleptics of 18th century
            Europe, from prehistoric tale to Arthurian romance.
            <i>Zombies</i> even examines the notion of the "living dead" in the
            world today—entities such as the "living mummies" of Japan.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Zombies</i> is a unique book, the only one to systematically
            trace the development of a cultural idea of physical resurrection
            and explore the myths that have grown around it, including the
            miracles of Old Testament prophets. It will interest those enticed
            by the return of the corporeal dead and also those curious as to how
            such an idea sits within the historical context.
