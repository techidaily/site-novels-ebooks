          "A refreshing change to read something that openly challenges
          entrenched opinions on a very contentious topic. A highly recommended
          read." --Peter J. Morris, alternative writer, research, and blogger<br /><br />"During
          the decades when society has generally been barred from the careful
          and legal use of pure psychedelics, MAPS has supported research in the
          U.S. and elsewhere on the use of mindful molecules in the treatment
          for example, of post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety about dying
          from a disease such as cancer." --Craig Comstock, co-author of<i>
            Sanctions for Evil: Sources of Social Destructiveness</i
          ><br /><br />“As psychedelics move from taboo subject to trendy topic,
          and as mainstream media outlets excitedly cover new psychedelic
          research, this collection of serious and highly readable articles is
          an especially wonderful gift. This is a must-have anthology for its
          amazing diversity and valuable content.”&nbsp;--James Fadiman, PhD,
          researcher and author of
          <i
            >The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide: Safe, Therapeutic, and Sacred
            Journeys</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The pages of the <i>MAPS Bulletin</i> have always reached out to
          people from all cultures and persuasions to represent psychedelics’
          potential for medicine, cultural development, spirituality, and
          personal growth. And now we have this generous smorgasbord of
          <i>Bulletin</i> pieces gathered together to be enjoyed in a single
          volume. What an excellent book to courageously transmit psychedelic
          research into tomorrow.”&nbsp;--Ben Sessa, MD, psychiatrist and
          psychedelic researcher<br /><br />“The varieties of psychedelic
          experience are boundless and beyond words, but this enlightening
          anthology manages to map much of that ineffable territory. Thank you,
          MAPS, for helping us understand the science and the spirit that
          support this endless journey.” --Don Lattin,<b> </b>journalist and<b
          > </b>author of <i>The Harvard Psychedelic Club</i> and
          <i>Distilled Spirits</i><br />
          <i>&nbsp;</i><br />
          “A deep, exciting collection of brilliant minds sharing research,
          cosmologies, humor, and imagination centered on my favorite topics:
          psychedelics and consciousness. Fascinating reading!”--Carolyn
          “Mountain Girl” Garcia, loyal member of the Merry Pranksters
