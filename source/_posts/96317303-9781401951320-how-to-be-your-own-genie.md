          "Radleigh Valentine has penned a fun, inviting, enthusiastic, and very
          special book. He deftly manages to weave angels, wish fulfillment,
          manifesting your best life, and personal stories (some poignant, but
          most hilarious) with glitter, love, and a heartfelt honesty and
          integrity that’s so refreshing in the spiritual self-help world. You
          will smile through it all and remember who you really are. When you
          accept his invitation to Genie Academy, you’ll learn that life is
          magic, you are magic, and there is nothing stopping you from living
          your best life! Bravo, Radleigh, for sharing your fabulous joy and
          miracle-making secrets with all of us!"<br />—&nbsp;<b

          show you how to wave your own personal magic wand and let the miracles
          flood in! I found myself laughing and nodding big yeses all the way

          You’ll never need to buy another self-help book; everything you need
          is in this gem of a book. You will learn how to embrace joy . . . and
          release everything else. With a light and open heart, Radleigh
          Valentine gently and graciously guides you through life’s meandering
