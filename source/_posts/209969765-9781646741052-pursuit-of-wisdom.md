            Pursuit of Wisdom by Robert T. Fertig is a book about finding the
            truth in everything that surrounds us. We<br />all want acceptance
            and unconditional love; we crave it and it is in our most basic
            nature. However, we are also<br />curious by nature, which is the
            reason why we need to know and understand the meaning behind the
            most<br />common things in life. From understanding the “truth” of
            cultural change, climate change and even how or if<br />we can live
            together as a community, these are the questions that we ask
            ourselves every day. The author talks<br />about how these truths
            are important, how they are necessary for us to build a community,
            build trust and<br />understand what it takes to accept every human
            being as a valuable addition to the community.
          </p>

            The author shares his thoughts about his general understanding of
            what truth is, what is goodness, what exactly is<br />justice and
            how every basic need of humans comes down to finding the most
            objective answer to their questions.<br />Everything has a “truth”
            and if you understand that, you can understand everything else. This
            is the beginning<br />of an awakening that the author believes every
            reader should have. I have immense respect for the author for<br />conveying
            such a complicated idea in such a simple yet eloquent way. He had
            control over the narrative, he<br />had a flow in mind and he
            executed it perfectly. I enjoyed the fact that the author didn’t
            force anything on the<br />reader; he just laid out his ideas and
            his thoughts on the pages and gave it to the reader to make whatever
            they<br />want with it. This is enlightening and educational at the
            same time.
