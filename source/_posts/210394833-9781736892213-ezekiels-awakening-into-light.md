            Ezekiel left his life and love behind to become a devotee of an
            ashram on the other side of the world, but it didn't take long
            before he struck out again on his own, to the great chagrin and
            rebuke of his brother monks. Leaving his two-man transcendental band
            behind, Ezekiel embarked on a "journey to nowhere" - more
            specifically, to Florida, abandoning the life of pure asceticism and
            brotherhood for solitude and study on his own terms. However, even
            after decades of isolation, his past came to find him, in the form
            of his 35-year-old son, Maurice. Ezekiel's awakening is sparked by
            this unexpected visit, from a son desperate to deliver on a promise
            to his mother.&nbsp;

            Ezekiel returns to Guyana to reconnect with Myra, the woman he had
            left behind thirty-six years earlier, but three decades apart have
            changed them both in innumerable ways, and while the initial passion
            of their reunion is bright and authentic, dark resentments lie just
            over the horizon. The titular character's revelations then come in
            disjointed stages throughout the book, as he renegotiates his
            relationship with love, family, and duty. Though Ezekiel had spent
            decades focused on himself and seeking truth, the real test of his
            wisdom doesn't come until he must face his past, and all that he had
            abandoned during his quest for enlightenment.
