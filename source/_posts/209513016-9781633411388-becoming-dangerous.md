              >"A fierce and voluble refutation of the patriarchy and its
              soul-crushing oppression of female power. These writers make clear
              that as witches, femmes, and queers, they will use their own
              strength, ingenious rituals, beauty routines, and spells to rise
              above and beyond the limits of racism/classism and
              objectifications set by a male-dominated society. While bound by a
              thread of magic, these are inspiring feminist writings for readers
              of feminist literature, however identified.” --<i

            Edgy and often deeply personal, the twenty-one essays collected here
            come from a wide variety of writers. Some identify as witches,
            others identify as writers, musicians, game developers, or artists.
            What they have in common is that they’ve created personal rituals to
            summon their own power in a world that would prefer them powerless.
            Here, they share the rituals they use to resist self-doubt, grief,
            and depression in the face of sexism, slut shaming, racism,
            patriarchy, and other systems of oppression.

          "This isn't a book on how to become a witch. Rather, it's a book about
          what it means to be a witch, written by women and femmes for whom the
          word "witch" is as much a part of their identity as their skin, their
          sexuality, and their gender. Ultimately, though, this is a book about
          magic, real, operant magic, the kind which changes reality. It's a
          book about where that magic comes from, and how queer women and
          femmes, women of color, and trans women have used it since the dawn of
          humanity to survive in a world which would just as soon have them
          enslaved or dead." --<b>Misha Magdalene</b>, <i>Patheos</i>
