            So much more than a question, "Who Told You That?" delivers a
            profound, yet practical opportunity to stimulate and exterminate the
            covert operation of status quo thought. It's calculated provocation
            carefully positioned in the pages encourages both intentional
            honesty and uninhibited transparency, while providing inspiration,
            information, and transformation. Through various snapshots of his
            life journey, Don passionately calls one's mind to attention, to
            participate and even perspire mentally, emotionally, and spiritually
            in a quest of a new-found freedom from self-sabotage and ultimate
            defeat.&nbsp;

            Regardless how many books have been written, read, and quoted, we
            just don't know what we don't know. Whether imposed or carried from
            childhood, or the result of an evolution of life events, our
            collective choices are being influenced by valued voices. Good, bad,
            or ugly, identifying the systemic and systematic sources for what
            often appears to be tight and right while potentially wayward and
            wrong is paramount. This cannot be attained without one's commitment
            to being honest, first and foremost, with themselves. We must assume
            the primary role and responsibility of initiating, facilitating, and
            participating in our own search and rescue. The future begins to
            become brighter the moment we establish the probable cause for a
            "self" centered pause.&nbsp;

          Thousands of years ago the renowned Hebrew champion, poet, and king -
          the man we know as David, wrote in Psalm 26:2-3, from the intimacy of
          his heart directly to God, "Examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my
          reins and my heart. For thy loving kindness is before mine eyes: And I
          have walked in thy truth." In these few heart-felt words we hear the
          echo of our own hopes, aspirations, faith, and "soul cries" to God to
          help us, examine us, and guide us as we hope in Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
          "Who Told You That?", author Don Hand expertly guides us through an
          essential self-journey of exploration, examination, and eye-opening
          honesty in which we take a deep search of our life, who we are, and
          who we are called to be. Hand unflinchingly helps the reader to shine
          a flashlight of truth on our own self-imposed hindrances to
          understanding and becoming all that we are meant to be and do in this
          one precious life we live.&nbsp;&nbsp;He helps us to examine our
          hearts, see the corresponding results we witnessed in our lives and
          get beyond excuses and complacency and into the rich place of personal
          passion and life fulfillment! I've known Don Hand for many years and
          believe me when I say that he will lead you on a life-road with which
          he is personally quite intimate. It's time for you to defeat doubt and
          self-sabotage.
