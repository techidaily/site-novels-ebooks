          <p>
            It is acknowledged Church doctrine that sorcery is the specific
            domain of the Devil. Yet occult tales are liberally sprinkled
            throughout the Old and New Testaments, from the spirit-invoking
            Witch of Endor to the story of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead.
            Throughout its 2,000 year history, the Church has spawned numerous
            mystical religious orders, like the Knights Templar, that may have
            been engaged in supernatural pursuits, while no fewer than three
            popes were believed to be involved in occult practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christian scriptures tell us that the occult is real, while Catholic
            priests are thought to have spiritual power over ghosts and evil
            entities. But if a priest can cast out demons during the rites of
            exorcism, does it not imply he has the ability to summon them as
            well?
          </p>
          <p>
            In this eye-opening, provocative work, leading occult scholar Simon
            examines the Church's unspoken relationship with forbidden magic by
            exploring the infamous seventeenth-century document considered by
            some to be the most demonic of all occult texts—the
            <i>Grimoire of Pope Honorius III</i>—and illuminates the Vatican's
            darkest hidden corners.

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Simon is a student of magic, occultism, and religion since the
          mid-1960s and the editor of the <i>Necronomicon</i>, Simon was a
          frequent lecturer for the famed Warlock Shop in Brooklyn and the
          Magickal Childe Bookstore in Manhattan for more than ten years before
          his sudden disappearance in 1984, speaking on topics as diverse as
          religion and politics, occultism and fascism, ceremonial magic,
          demonolatry, the Tarot, the Qabala, and Asian occult systems. He also
          conducted private classes for the New York City OTO during this
          period, with a focus on Enochian magic, "Owandering bishops," and
          Afro-Caribbean occult beliefs. An ordained priest of an Eastern
          Orthodox church, Simon has appeared on television and radio discussing
          such topics as exorcism, satanism, and Nazism. The media events he
          organized in the 1970s and 1980s -- with rock bands, ritual
          performances, and celebrity appearances -- helped to promote the
          "occult renaissance" in New York City. After decades of study in
          European, Asian, and Latin American cult centers, this book marks his
          first public appearance in more than twenty years.
