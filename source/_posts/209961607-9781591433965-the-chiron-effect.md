          A guide to using astrology to identify your core wounds and heal them
          using psychological techniques, affirmations, and self-compassion
          <br /><br />• Explains how the placement of Chiron in your birth chart
          identifies the core wounds and unconscious patterns that block empathy
          and self-forgiveness <br /><br />• Offers a descriptive chapter for
          each of the 12 zodiac sign placements for Chiron, revealing how Chiron
          affects you psychologically, emotionally, sexually, spiritually,
          socially, financially, and intellectually <br /><br />• Provides
          specific steps for each sign to shift self-destructive patterns as
          well as powerful affirmations infused with Reiki healing energy
          <br /><br />We all have experienced disappointment, sadness,
          rejection, or the loss of something meaningful in our lives. When you
          are wounded, innate animalistic instincts for self-protection kick in
          as a means for survival. These behavior patterns are a natural and
          necessary coping strategy, at first. But many dwell far too long in
          these patterns and separate themselves from their source of inner
          wisdom and intuition. <br /><br />Using astrology as a diagnostic
          tool, Lisa Tahir reveals how to use the astrological placement of the
          minor planet Chiron in your birth chart to identify the core wounds
          and unconscious patterns that block your capacity to have self-empathy
          and to forgive. Coining the phrase “Chiron Effect” to describe the
          magnetic pull that individuals have around specific areas of
          vulnerability, she explains how, like a raw nerve, the placement of
          Chiron describes what parts of our lives we might edit or hide for
          fear of being rejected as well as the areas of sensitivity where we
          are triggered. Offering a chart and online links to allow you to
          determine Chiron’s placement in your chart, the author explains how
          Chiron affects you psychologically, emotionally, sexually,
          spiritually, socially, financially, and intellectually depending on
          the sign and house it falls within. She outlines how to begin healing
          your core wounds through empathy and self-forgiveness, providing
          several steps for each sign placement to shift self-destructive
          patterns and learn to protect yourself as well as powerful
          affirmations infused with Reiki healing energy to help you anchor a
          new belief system. <br /><br />As Lisa Tahir reveals, once identified,
          your personal Chiron placement can become the source of your greatest
          healing and empowerment. By recognizing your core wounding and
          learning to offer yourself empathy and forgiveness, you can finally
          break free from suffering, end self-sabotage, and allow your life to
          unfold in a new way.
