          "I must admit I was completely blown away by how relatable this book
          is. One of the stumbling blocks I've come across in some new-age
          spiritual books is they feel like they were written for a specific
          audience, and if you don't fall in that category, the book doesn't
          help you. Landry writes as though she is sitting down and talking to a
          friend over a cup of coffee, making this exceptionally accessible for
          people from all walks of life and levels of enlightenment. The soul
          isn't something that often concerns us in everyday life.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          There are so many other pressures vying for our attention, that the
          spirit is often left behind. Our soul makes us whole and losing it can
          have negative consequences for us and how we interact with our
          environment. Landry's quest to find her soul began in a simple way -
          at the bedside of a dying man, who left her with important words of
          wisdom before he crossed beyond this world. Reading her story of how
          those few words sparked a spirit journey is inspiring. Searching for
          one's soul takes dedication and a desire to reunite with your higher
          self. While unfolding the story of her quest for her soul, Landry
          touches on some important points. First, the visions and dreams. The
          ones that let her see her soul and other beings that do not have
          mortal forms. Her imagery is transcendental, making the reader feel as
          if they are seeing everything through her eyes.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          On a personal note, I felt a deep, instinctual connection to Landry
          while reading this book. It was strange at first, but it was as if my
          soul was reaching for hers. Although I had never read this before, it
          was as if I already understood the path we followed. At the end I felt
          as if I had a deeper understanding of my soul and the universe, as
          well as clear way forward. I highly recommend this book for anyone. No
          matter your beliefs or the road you currently travel through in this
          life, Landry's story has something for you. There is a universal truth
          woven into her words that speaks to your innermost heart. A must-read
          for everyone who is looking for a higher meaning in this life."
