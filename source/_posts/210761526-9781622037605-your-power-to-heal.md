            <b>Your Essential How-To Guide for Self-Healing </b
            ><br />&nbsp;<br />The greatest medical breakthrough in recent years
            isn’t the creation of a new drug or treatment—it’s the discovery of
            how much your mind affects your health. With
            <i>Your Power to Heal,</i> Dr. Henry Grayson offers a treasury of
            techniques and insights to help you harness the mindbody connection.
            “When we can identify and change the inner voices that keep us
            feeling powerless,” writes Dr. Grayson, “we can go beyond treating
            just symptoms or relying on doctors to fix us. We have far greater
            potential to heal than we realize.”<br />&nbsp;<br />In this
            practical guidebook, Dr. Grayson presents life-changing insights and
            effective tools anyone can use, including:<br />&nbsp;<br />• The
            new physics of healing—the ever-expanding body of research that
            reveals our untapped capacity for self-healing<br />• Simple tips to
            nip many symptoms in the bud as they start<br />• Self-assessment
            questionnaires to help you locate and change subconscious beliefs
            and disturbances<br />• The Emotional Freedom Technique for
            resolving trauma and restoring your vitality<br />• Thought Field
            Therapy to clear the blockages in your body’s energy system that are
            impeding health<br />• Why therapy, diets, and exercise regimens
            often fail—and how to make them succeed<br />&nbsp;<br />You don’t
            need years of meditation practice to use your mind to improve your
            health. <i>Your Power to Heal </i>is an invaluable resource to help
            you harness the power of your own thoughts, transform illness at its
            source instead of just alleviating symptoms, and start taking charge
            of your health today.

          <b>Henry Grayson</b><br />Henry Grayson, PhD, received his degree from
          Boston University and a postdoctoral certificate in Psychoanalysis and
          Psychotherapy from four years of postdoctoral training at the
          Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in New York City. He is the
          founder and Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of the National
          Institute for the Psychotherapies in New York, a postgraduate local
          and national psychotherapy training institute chartered by the Board
          of Regents in New York. He also founded and is director of the
          Institute for Spirituality, Science, and Psychotherapy, and is the
          founder and past president of the Association for Spirituality and
          Psychotherapy—a national membership organization. He was the resident
          psychologist on The Weight Watchers Magazine Show, hosted by Lynn
          Redgrave on Lifetime.<br />He is the coauthor of three professional
          books: Three Psychotherapies: A Clinical Comparison, Short-Term
          Approaches to Psychotherapy, and Changing Approaches to the
          Psychotherapies, as well as numerous chapters and articles. He is also
          the author of Mindful Loving: 10 Practices for Creating Deeper
          Connections. With Sounds True, he recorded a nine-CD audio series
          called The New Physics of Love: The Power of Mind and Spirit in
          Relationships.<br />Dr. Grayson studied Eastern and Western spiritual
          philosophies, quantum physics, neuropsychology (the new brain scan
          studies), and most of the major psychotherapies. He has created
          innovations on the new “power therapies” such as EMDR, Emotional
          Freedom Techniques (EFT), Tapas Acupressure Technique (TAT), Thought
          Field Therapy (TFT), as well as non-local mind studies and other new
          sciences, and integrates them into the practice of his Synergetic
          Therapy in New York City and Connecticut. He lectures widely across
          the United States and abroad, and has a weekly radio show on the
          Progressive Radio Network.
