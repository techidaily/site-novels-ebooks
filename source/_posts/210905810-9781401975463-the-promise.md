          ><br /><br />“Hello, beautiful soul. You are about to embark on a
          journey unlike one you’ve ever experienced, a powerful crash course in
          accessing your light, which is the source of your authentic self . .
          .”&nbsp;<br />— from the <i>Introduction</i><br /><br />In
          <i>The Promise</i>, entrepreneur, philanthropist, and best-selling
          author Mandy Morris explores the importance of connecting the trials
          and tribulations of our everyday lives to the beautiful story that we,
          the infinite beings of this Universe, are all entitled to live. Unbind
          yourself from the fears and doubts that drag you down to the darkest
          trenches of your life and learn how to handle adversity in a new, more
          assured and confident way, just as the Universe intended you to do.<br /><br />Reconnecting
          with the Universe and discovering your inner strength has never been
          simpler as Mandy shares the seven pathways of the Universe that are
          designed to bring us out of the darkness of human conditioning and
          into the light. There is a path to follow for any circumstance you may
          be going through. By understanding how to harness the powers of
          Expansion, Self-Knowledge, Empathy, Clarity, Transmutation,
          Co-creation, and Coherence, you will be prepared for whatever
          challenges you may face.<br /><br />No longer do you have to wade in
          the darkness. Run into the light and feel the love, feel connected,
          and feel the Universe flowing through you as you embark on the divine
          story that you were born to live. The Universe made you a promise;
          it’s time to believe it.

        <p>
          Mandy Morris is the founder of Authentic Living, an educational
          organization that has more than 800,000 students in over 60 countries,
          with both online and in-person courses designed to help individuals
          rewire their mind, heart, and energy for total abundance in all
          aspects of life.<br /><br />Mandy’s science- and love-based methods
          for creating instant and lasting change have been studied, taught, and
          used all over the world by therapists and coaches. Currently, her
          certified coaches practice globally. Mandy worked in Scandinavia and
          the U.S. to study how an individual’s brain patterns changed through
          her communicative therapy methodology, which focuses on getting to the
          root of a flawed belief to eliminate the symptomatic issues. Mandy
          works with childhood programming, sabotaging beliefs, trigger
          management, abusive relationships, trauma, the science of manifesting,
          and the law of attraction.<br /><br />Mandy currently lives in
          Colorado with her husband, two sons, horses, dogs, and chickens near
          the Authentic Living Heartland, a sacred retreat center owned by Mandy
          for souls that come to learn, grow, and heal.<br /><br />To learn more
