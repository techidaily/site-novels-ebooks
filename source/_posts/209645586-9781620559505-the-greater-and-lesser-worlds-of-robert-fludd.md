          An illustrated reference book on a seminal figure of occult philosophy
          and Renaissance thought <br /><br />• Explains Fludd’s thoughts on
          cosmic harmonies, divination, the kabbalah, astrology, geomancy,
          alchemy, the Rosicrucians, and multiple levels of existence
          <br /><br />• Includes more than 200 of Fludd’s illustrations,
          representing the whole corpus of Fludd’s iconography, each one
          accompanied by Godwin’s expert commentary <br /><br />• Explores
          Fludd’s medical work as an esoteric Paracelsian physician and his
          theories on the macrocosm of elements, planets, stars, and subtle and
          divine beings and the microcosm of the human being and its creative
          activities, including material never before translated <br /><br />One
          of the last Renaissance men, Robert Fludd (1574-1637) was one of the
          great minds of the early modern period. A physician by profession, he
          was also a Christian Hermetist, a Rosicrucian, an alchemist,
          astrologer, musician, and inventor. His drive to encompass the whole
          of human knowledge--from music to alchemy, from palmistry to
          fortification--resulted in a series of books remarkable for their
          hundreds of engravings, a body of work recognized as the first example
          of a fully-illustrated encyclopedia. <br /><br />In this in-depth,
          highly illustrated reference, scholar and linguist Joscelyn Godwin
          explains Fludd’s theories on the correspondence between the macrocosm
          of elements, planets, stars, and subtle and divine beings and the
          microcosm of the human being and its creative activities. He shows how
          Fludd’s two worlds--the macrocosm and the microcosm--along with
          Paracelsus’s medical principles and the works of Hermes Trismegistus
          provided the foundation for his search for the cause and cure of all
          diseases. The more than 200 illustrations in the book represent the
          whole corpus of Fludd’s iconography, each one accompanied by Godwin’s
          expert commentary and explanation. Sharing many passages translated
          for the first time from Fludd’s Latin, allowing him to speak for
          himself, Godwin explores Fludd’s thoughts on cosmic harmonies,
          divination, the kabbalah, astrology, geomancy, and the rapport between
          the multiple levels of existence. He also analyzes Fludd’s writings in
          defense of alchemy and the Rosicrucians. <br /><br />An essential
          reference for scholars of Renaissance thinkers, traditional cosmology,
          metaphysics, and the Western esoteric tradition, this book offers
          intimate access to Fludd’s worlds and gives one a feel for an epoch in
          which magic, science, philosophy, spirituality, and imagination could
          still cohabit and harmonize within a single mind.

          “Robert Fludd attempted to embrace the whole of nature and man and of
          theory and practice in his volumes on the macrocosm, the microcosm,
          and medicine and worked out his ideas through striking images.
          Joscelyn Godwin, in this masterly book, lays out the whole of Fludd’s
          world in all its splendor.”
