            everyday enlightenment from <i>New York Times </i>best-selling
            author Kimberly Snyder.</b
          ><br /><br />Many of us think that we just aren’t enough. Not good
          enough, not pretty enough, not rich enough, and not happy enough. But
          just because we think something doesn’t mean it’s true. YOU ARE MORE
          THAN YOU THINK YOU ARE teaches you how to revise your belief system,
          fulfill your deepest dreams and desires, and create an epic,
          successful, and inspiring life.<br />&nbsp;<br />Unlocking your True
          Self is the key to new levels of joy, beauty, and peace. But what is
          the True Self, and how can you realize its infinite potential? In this
          easy-to-read book, Kimberly Snyder answers these questions and shows
          you how to tap into this unstoppable force to transform every aspect
          of your life for the better.<br />&nbsp;<br />Drawing inspiration from
          the teachings of the great guru Paramahansa Yogananda along with
          personal stories and the latest scientific research, Kimberly offers
          simple exercises, potent ancient practices, and in-depth meditations
          to help you overcome negative beliefs and see yourself as you truly
          are—a goddess, a warrior, a lover, and a creator of your extraordinary
          destiny.

          — Deepak Chopra, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling
          author&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />“<i
            >You Are More Than You Think You Are</i
          >
          is an intriguing and valuable practical guide that uniquely meshes
          ancient Eastern wisdom with the supportive science of mental
          wellness.&nbsp;No matter where you are in your personal journey, this
          book helps enhance your emotional resilience and let go of blocks that
          keep you from sustaining a positive, healthy perspective on life.”<br />
          — Dan Buettner, #1 <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author, National
          Geographic Fellow, and founder of the Blue Zones <br /><br />“Kimberly
          Snyder is one of the most vibrant spiritual writers of the day. This
          book will not only inspire you to see beyond your limitations, it will
          draw you ever closer to your True Self, that inner place of
          transcendent beauty, personal power, and infinite potential.” <br />
          — Gary Jansen, award-winning author of <i>MicroShifts</i
          ><br /><br />&nbsp;“<i>You Are More Than You Think You Are</i> is an
          empowering guide into awakening the conscious and fearless warrior
          that lies within us all. Kimberly thoughtfully weaves together ancient
          teachings, science, inspiring personal stories, and daily practices
          that give the reader a roadmap to harnessing the power of living from
          the True Self.”<br />
          — Dr. Shefali Tsabary, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author and
          clinical psychologist <br /><br />“In
          <i>You Are More Than You Think</i> <i>You Are</i>, Kimberly Snyder
          takes you on a journey to break through all the stories, shame, and
          blockages that have stopped you from being the light that you are.
          Step-by-step you are guided to see that love is not something you go
          searching for, but more so something that is already here within you.
          I was moved by the vulnerability and strength held within this
          book.”<br />— Kyle Gray, best-selling author of
          <i>Raise Your Vibration</i> and <i>Angel Prayers</i><br /><br />“The
          wisdom of India has guided millions in the quest to discover who and
          what they really are. No one did more to foster that East-West
          transmission than Paramahansa Yogananda, and this wise, user-friendly
          book shows exactly how to use his powerful teachings to make our lives
          deeper, happier, and more fulfilling.” <br />
          — Philip Goldberg, author of <i>The Life of Yogananda</i> and
          <i>Spiritual Practice for Crazy Times</i><br /><br />“Truly
          empowering!&nbsp;Kimberly is addressing a very needed topic in her new
          book. I highly recommend this book if you want to&nbsp;learn how to
          embrace and love yourself.”&nbsp;<br />— Dr. Karol Darsa,&nbsp;author
