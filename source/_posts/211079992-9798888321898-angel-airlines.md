            Do you think heaven isn't real and God doesn't intervene in our
            lives? Our maker not only knows each one of us intimately, but he
            genuinely cares about us. Having experienced such profound grief at
            the deaths of my parents in 1988 and 1989, I was angry and resentful
            at God for taking them away. They were good Christians who raised
            eight children in the faith and worked extremely hard all their
            lives. They did not deserve the cruel twists of fate that had
            befallen them when dad lost his airline job about 18 months before
            his retirement and suffered a major heart attack, only to be
            followed by mom getting breast cancer and succumbing to it almost 5
            years later. All I know is that they were near retirement and died
            much too young, and I was profoundly bitter.

            Is there nothing too hard for God? I think not, as he not only
            created a start-up airline called "Jet Train," but whose corporate
            office just happened to be in Aliquippa, PA, the town we were
            residing in at the time. It was through my encounter with this
            airline where I would come to terms with their deaths and find
            peace. God then continued to bless me through Orbs and Spirits
            captured in photography taken. God knew I would author a book about
            it someday and tell the world. Of course he did, God knows
            everything, so here I am, and I am telling the world, "we don't die,
            we go on," God gave me proof, and so the story begins.
