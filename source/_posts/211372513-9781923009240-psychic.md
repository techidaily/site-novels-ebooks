        </h4>
        <p>
          Jade-Sky is a Psychic/Medium-a “direct channeller”. She was born with
          a special gift of being able to connect clairvoyantly with energies of
          deceased loved ones. Over the past 15 years Jade-Sky has fine tuned
          her natural skills in the areas of tarot and oracle card reading,
          psychometry, mediumship/channeling and uncovering past lives.<br />
          <br />
          Jade-Sky has read professionally for over 7,000 clients around the
          world, who testify to her accuracy.<br />
          Mediumship is Jade-Sky’s passion. During a reading she offers up key
          names, dates and specific events to the enquirer so that they know
          without doubt that their passed loved ones or spirit guides/angels are
          with them. She also provides very personal and significant details to
          help clients reconnect with their loved ones, something which assists
          with their grieving process.<br />

          By giving detailed information, Jade-Sky reassures her clients that
          life after death does exist and a beautiful place awaits us when we
          pass from this life to the next.As well as conducting private readings
          and workshops, Jade-Sky has spoken and appeared live on stage at the
          nation-wide Mind, Body, Spirit Festivals and featured on BIO5,2GB and
          NOVA radio stations.<br />
          <br />
          Based in Brisbane, Queensland, Jade-Sky travels extensively and can do
          so on several planes, be them spiritual or physical!<br />
          "A+++, so accurate on so many levels. To pin point changes in my life
          and things that were about to happen left me inspired and
          speechless"<br />
          Smallzy - Nova 106.9 Announcer<br />
          <br />
          "Jade is the best psychic I ever seen. How she has helped me can
          barely be put into words…. You leave the room feeling as though you’ve
          just met a person that knows you better than yourself. She truly is a
          very special individual."<br />
          Chris Parsons | Producer / Presenter TPD Media<br />
          <br />
          "There are a lot of mediums out there today performing 'shows'.
          Jade-Sky is one of the few performing a public service."<br />
