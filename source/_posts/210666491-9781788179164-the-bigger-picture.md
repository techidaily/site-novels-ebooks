            >Can psychedelic drugs help us tackle the biggest problems we face
            globally? Can they heal the cultural, spiritual, and political
            wounds we’re wrestling with?</b
          ><br /><br />Psychedelics have hit the mainstream as powerful new
          mental health treatments. But as clinicians explore what these
          molecules can do for our individual minds,
          <i>The Bigger Picture</i> goes further to illuminate how psychedelics
          can help us find new ways to make sense of and come through the crises
          we face around the world.<br /><br />Drawing on the latest research,
          as well as his unique experience as a participant in a ground-breaking
          clinical trial investigating the potent psychedelic DMT, Alexander
          Beiner reveals:<br /><br />the role of psychedelics in addressing
          global issues such as global warming, geopolitical instability, and
          political polarization the dark side of the ‘psychedelic renaissance’
          and ‘psychedelic capitalism’what it takes to elicit huge personal and
          cultural transformation through psychedelics<br />Embark on a journey
          into <i>The Bigger Picture – </i>a new era of science and spirituality
          with the potential to radically transform our perceptions of
          ourselves, one another, and our life on this planet.

          ‘Although they will perhaps always remain mysterious, psychedelics
          have also always invited us – and our ancestors – to heed the
          teachings they have to offer, to reconsider our place in the universe,
          and to recognize the enigma of our own existence.
          <i>The Bigger Picture </i>adds substantial new information to our
          understanding of psychedelics and their potentially momentous
          significance to the world today. I highly recommend this carefully and
          convincingly argued, deeply thought-provoking and beautifully written
          book.’ –<b>Graham Hancock<br /><br /></b>‘<i>The Bigger Picture </i>is
          an entertaining, insightful, and timely book. Beiner draws on the
          latest psychedelic science to explain how what we’re learning about
          these molecules can help us make sense of our social and political
          challenges in new ways, and he ties together research from a variety
          of different fields to present a compelling and nuanced argument as to
          why psychedelic science could change the world for the better.’ –<b

          >, Founder of the Centre for Psychedelic Research at Imperial College
          London, and Director of Psychedelics Division, Neuroscape, UCSF<br /><br />‘Beiner
          is a wise and entertaining guide through the jungle of contemporary
          psychedelics, bringing much-needed critical thinking to the field’.
