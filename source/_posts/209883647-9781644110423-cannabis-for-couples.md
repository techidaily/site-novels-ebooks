          A step-by-step guide for using cannabis to deepen relationships
          emotionally, sexually, and spiritually <br /><br />• Explains the
          difference between getting high alone and as a couple and explores
          what happens from a psychological and neurological perspective
          <br /><br />• Offers techniques to maximize the effects of being high,
          facilitate bonding, and resolve relationship issues, plus how to use
          cannabis as an aphrodisiac <br /><br />• Examines marijuana’s effects
          on the chakras, including its impact on the heart chakra, and how to
          harness these effects to expand consciousness <br /><br />When couples
          enjoy cannabis together in the proper set and setting, the experience
          can deepen relationships through honest sharing and compassionate
          bonding, as well as boosting sexual pleasure, emotional growth, and
          spiritual togetherness. <br /><br />In this step-by-step guide to
          harnessing the benefits of getting high together, psychologist John
          Selby explores how to use cannabis as a powerful and effective path to
          strengthen your relationship and nurture your intimate life. Drawing
          on his own NIH brain research on the emotional impact of psychoactive
          chemicals, he explains the difference between getting high alone and
          as a couple and examines from a psychological and neurological
          perspective what happens when you get high. Revealing the seven
          primary types of inner experience and outer behavior stimulated by
          THC, the author shares stories from his four decades of practice as a
          couple’s therapist, discussing the power of THC and other cannabinoids
          to help heal emotional wounds and boost intimacy--and how to determine
          if using cannabis together is right for you and your partner.
          <br /><br />The author explains how to properly prepare for a cannabis
          session and how to use breath, meditation, and other focusing
          techniques to deepen the effects of being high and facilitate bonding.
          He reveals how cannabis-assisted relating can not only deepen
          relationships but also help to heal anxiety, depression, and PTSD.
          This book also explores the use of cannabis for sexual pleasure and
          how the “muse of marijuana” can serve as an inner therapist to work
          out relationship issues. Shared laughter and emotional freedom are
          likewise encouraged. Selby also explores cannabis’s energetic
          influence on the chakras and how to balance and integrate the seven
          energy centers together with your partner during a cannabis session.
          <br /><br />Combining decades of counseling experience with scientific
          research, Selby encourages couples to enjoy recreational use and begin
          using cannabis as a unique tool for connecting as a couple and growing
          together emotionally, sexually, and spiritually.

          dimension of ecstatic interaction? Are you openminded enough not to be
          bothered about our culture’s mostly foolish admonitions against a
          simple, completely natural herb like cannabis? If so, here’s a simply
          great guided program for you and yours on how to elevate your
          intimacy. Highly recommended!”
