            >A concise and inspirational book for anyone dealing with pain by a
            long time palliative care doctor who is greatly inspired by Native
            American wisdom and the natural world. This book is a celebration of
            impermanence and what it means to be awake, alive, and connected to
            the world.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>The Nest in the Stream</i>&nbsp;is an encouraging and
          inspiring book for the times we live in. Michael Kearney, a physician
          whose day job is alleviating the pain and suffering of others, shows
          that how we live with our pain matters hugely, as it affects our
          quality of living and our capacity to find healing for ourselves, for
          others, and for our world. Drawing on engaged Buddhism, the indigenous
          wisdom of Native American and Celtic spirituality, and the powerful
          teachings he gained by observing nature, Kearney presents a new model
          for resilience and self-care.&nbsp;<br /><br />Traditional models of
          self-care emphasize the importance of professional boundaries to
          protect us from stress, and time out to rest and recover.&nbsp;<i
            >The Nest in the Stream</i
          >offers a way of being with pain that is infused with mindfulness,
          openness, compassion, and deep nature connection that encourages us to
          act for the freedom and welfare of all. It will appeal to those whose
          everyday occupation involves dealing with pain, such as healthcare
          workers, environmental activists, or those working on the front lines
          of trauma, but it will also be of interest to everyone who longs to
          live in our wounded world with an open heart.

          "In this dear book, Michael yet again takes us deeper, closer. He
          nudges us to see that to understand someone is to care for them. Yes,
          love them. This book is most directly about the cautions and craft of
          caregiving. And it is about receiving too, as though by necessity
          these come together. This is the sweet reciprocal loop that Michael
          has been pointing out to me for many years now and I’m so glad he’s
          offered us more stories and intimacies to reify this subtly potent
          point. For all its quietness, this book is full of brave explorations
          just beyond the line of familiarity. And since he dares to look and
          see––we can too." ––B.J. Miller MD, Zen Hospice Project, presenter of
          2015 TED talk, <i>What Really Matters at The End of Life<br /></i
          ><br />"Dr. Michael Kearney has shared with us a profound
          contemplation, heartfelt and moving, of the healing process in life
          and at death. Weaving Buddhist and other traditions we accompany him
          on the journey from letting go to moving on with meaning and grace."
          ––David Richo, PhD, MFT, author of <i>The Power of Grace</i>
