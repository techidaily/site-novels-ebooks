            God has inspired me to write this book, The Enemy Will Try to Steal
            Your Purpose. The enemy is designed to steal your purpose. This book
            will show you how to fight off the enemies’ attacks. If you have God
            on your side, you could never lose in life. Amen. God has designed
            us to win in life. The enemy sees your purpose early on. His mission
            is to destroy every aspect of your life.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I know that it is rough out here in this world today with the enemy
            running rapid. But we all need to come together as one to stop the
            enemy in his tracks. Amen. God loves us all; there’s nothing on this
            earth that God would not do for us and that is the truth. Amen.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I hope that this book will inspire you and give you the courage that
            you need to go through your everyday life. Brothers and sisters, I
            pray that you received the message that God is giving me to give to
            you. Amen. God is always there by our side. He is the positive force
            that guides us, yes he is. The enemy is the negative force. He is
            the one that’s always putting obstacles in front of us in our lives
            today. Always have Father God deep in your spirit, your soul, and
            your mind. Always put Father God ahead of your life. Always put your
            family next and always have your fellow man’s back Always pray and
            have that mind-set to have God on your mind. Amen. God has given us
            each a purpose in life. It is embedded deep in our spirit; all we
            have to do is release it. Amen. God is the source of our well-being.
            All we need to do is keep Father God in our lives and in our hearts,
            and everything should be fine for us. Amen. God bless. I hope you
            get something positive out of The Enemy Will Try to Steal Your
            Purpose. Enjoy.
