          YOU can do and be ANYTHING!!!!!EVERYONE needs motivation and
          inspiration, which can be found and seen in any and EVERYTHING. Also,
          there is never a wrong time or setting to be motivated—whether YOU’RE
          told YOU have cancer, YOU’RE at a funeral, seeing the birth of YOUR
          child, being told YOU won’t amount to shit in YOUR life, seeing the
          living situation YOU are in, etc. Time in this life WE live is all
          that WE have, so why not do all YOU can at YOUR very best to live a
          happy, peaceful, and best life?It’s common sense that lots of people
          have fears and insecurities, and some of US lack motivation, but YOU
          have got to find it somewhere. So here YOU go! This book is a gift.
          The best people to talk to are the ones that can relate to YOU or have
          made so many mistakes and bad decisions that it made THEM become so
          wise that THEY can give some of the best motivational advice that
          could help others. YOUR life is truly up to the way YOU interpret,
          view it, and create it. Think about it, each second is a set up for
          each minute, each minute leads to the hours in YOUR day, and the hours
          lead to the set up for YOUR days.Think before YOU react and also
          embrace and cherish YOUR disappointments just as much as YOU do YOUR
          accomplishments. Lessons are learned, and growth makes YOU stronger
          and better. Adversity and being YOUR biggest motivator are strong
          enough to push mountains and billions of people. Even when YOU feel
          like EVERYTHING is against YOU, YOU have got to know that if YOU give
          up, that leaves no chance of doing or seeing better. But by
          continuously striving for YOUR fulfillment, YOU are getting closer to
          where YOU need to be and also learning more about YOURSELF along the
          path that YOU thought was “perfectly planned” with a perfect straight
          line from point A to point B. Naw always keep a plan A, but also keep
          in mind there are going to be so many points YOU have to reach before
          YOU get to YOUR desired destination. YOU are going to be EVERYTHING
          YOU have ever talked about, but guess what?!?!? YOU have got to “KEEP
          TELLING YOURSELF THAT!”Bryan “Nappy” Vereen a.k.a. Topick
