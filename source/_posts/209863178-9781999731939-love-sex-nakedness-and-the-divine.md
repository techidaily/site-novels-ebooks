            Love, Sex, Nakedness and the Divine. It is a strange and sad thing
            that these words have had their meanings corrupted, denigrated and
            many taboos attached. Warning bells ring, yet desire is also aroused
            within to find out more.
          </p>
          <p>
            We look at each of these words in their purity and see how they can
            set us free, bring pleasure and even enlightenment. Within are ideas
            to help change beliefs and bring more self esteem, self love, Love,
            freedom and growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book contains a collection of Love letters, messages and ideas
            to assist on your journey back to Love. They are “Messages from Love
            to Empower and Enhance Your Journey,” and life on earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope and trust its thoughts, words, questions and practices will
            help you experience Love, Sex, Nakedness and the Divine, in many
            different lights and profoundly deeper ways.

          My nickname for Keith is the 'Love Man'. In his book of, what I would
          describe as a series of 'Love Essays', Keith is brave enough to write
          about taboo topics, like Sex and Nakedness and he does it from a place
          of total unconditional Love and understanding. My favourite line of
          his is, 'We came from Love, we are Love and we're in the process of
          returning to Love'.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book will have you examine your own relationship with Love, the
          Love you have for yourself, most importantly. This is not just a book,
          it's a manual, a blueprint and a search engine that will have you
          wishing and wondering how you also can step into that Divine Love and
          Wisdom that Keith shares with us all. Enjoy!

          One of the sweetest books about Love to date. Keith Higgs looks at
          love from every possible angle and keeps showing us over and over
          again how and why to do it. All you need is love!

          In 'Love, Sex, Nakedness and the Divine' Keith Higgs has bravely and
          skilfully created a book about, what is in my opinion, the greatest
          need of our world today, i.e., how to return to Truth, Oneness and
          Love. "There is only Love" he (continually and eloquently) points out,
          and "that Love is us."
        </p>
        <p>
          Through four powerful lenses (Love, Sex, Nakedness and the Divine)
          Keith paints a picture of our current world as a crazy illusionary
          dream, made up of fear, regret, separation and false truths. He clears
          a path from these back to the reality of true Love.
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite everyone to travel this amazing path back with Keith. It is
          lined with truly captivating, Spirit-infused language, which has been
          birthed from Keith's own inner searching, experiences of life and
          authentic dances with Spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both an invitation and a challenge to embrace the cosmic story of Love
          leap off every page of this beautiful book.

          Keith once again proves himself to be the master of that sacred ground
          where spiritual psychology meets Tantra. You might say it's the Kama
          Sutra meets A Course In Miracles.

          Keith's latest book is filled with beautiful quotes and inspiring
          messages and reminders on how to open to Love more in our life.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gently invites us to look at ourselves honestly and see where we
          can let go and invite even more Love and connection. Beautiful,
          inspiring, tender, and deeply insightful. Read it with an open heart
          and even more open mind and discover just how much Love is waiting for
          you.

          Keith has devoted much of his life in the search and exploration of
          this abstract term called Love—the Love of self and sacred union of
          the soul and the cosmos. He has distilled down collective
          consciousness into a pocket plan for mortal beings to follow and then
          brought them with a bang of Love rocket fuel to this new age, and onto
          and through these pages. He has made gateways and access points,
          stripping away the construct and constraints of shame by bravely
          addressing the taboo subject of nakedness with the knife blade of his
          penned truth. Words that can cut away any false illusions we have
          lived under.

          Along with his own unique expression which he has channelled and
          scribed wonderingly, to give a mix of poetry meeting quantum physics.
          Harvesting the science and transforming into introspective rhymes for
          this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I invite you to engage with this book and ride the wave lengths of
          Love.
