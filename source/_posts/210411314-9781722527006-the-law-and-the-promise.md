          <b>IMAGINING CREATES REALITY</b><br /><br />"When man solves the
          mystery of imagining, he will have discovered the secret of causation,
          and that is: Imagining creates reality. Therefore, the man who is
          aware of what he is imagining knows what he is creating; realizes more
          and more that the drama of life is imaginal—not physical." This book
          is Neville's last book, and is the summation and capstone of his
          career. As he states, "The purpose of this book is to show, through
          actual true stories, how imagining creates reality." Neville Includes
          many success stories from his students, and concludes with his
          description of four of his mystical experiences.<br /><br />NEVILLE
          GODDARD (1905-1972) was one of the most remarkable mystical thinkers
          of the past century. In more than ten books and thousands of lectures,
          Neville expanded on one core principle: the human imagination is God.
          He was a compelling presence at metaphysical churches, spiritual
          centers and auditoriums. Neville was not widely known during his
          lifetime, but today his books and lectures have attained new
          popularity. His principles have influenced several major spiritual
          writers, including Carlos Castaneda and Joseph Murphy.<br /><br />In
          this beautifully designed “deluxe edition” you benefit not only from
          Neville’s radical statement, but also from a comprehensive and
          enthralling analysis and biography of Neville, “Chariot of Fire,” by
          spiritual thinker Mitch Horowitz, who is considered the most powerful
          interpreter of Neville’s ideas today. Mitch’s comprehensive essay is a
          spiritual and historical journey in itself. This edition is rounded
          out with Mitch’s timeline of Neville’s life. Here is a resource book
          that you will turn to again and again.
