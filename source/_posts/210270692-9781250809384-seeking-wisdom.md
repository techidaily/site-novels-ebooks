              >Julia Cameron returns to the spiritual roots of the Artist’s Way
              in this 6-week Program</b
            ><br /><br />Author Julia Cameron changed the way the world thinks
            about creativity when she first published
            <i>The Artist’s Way: A Spiritual Path to Higher Creativity</i>
            thirty years ago. Over five million copies later, Cameron now turns
            her attention to creative prayer, which she believes is a key facet
            of the creative life. In <i>Seeking Wisdom</i>, a 6 Week Artist’s
            Way Program, readers, too, will learn to pray. <br /><br />Tracing
            her own creative journey, Cameron reveals that prayer led her
            forward at a time of personal crisis. Unexpectedly, prayer became an
            indispensable support to her artistic life. The tools she created to
            save herself in her darkest hour became the tools she would share
            with the world through <i>The </i><i>Artist's Way</i>.
            <i>Seeking Wisdom </i>details the origin of these tools, and by
            Cameron's example, the central role that prayer plays in sustaining
            a life as an artist. <br /><br />In this volume, Cameron shares a
            mindful collection of prayer practices that open our creative souls.
            This path takes us beyond traditional religious rituals, welcoming
            readers regardless of their beliefs and backgrounds. As you journey
            through each week of the program you’ll explore prayers of petition,
            gratitude, creativity, and more. Along the way, the three beloved
            tools of <i>The Artist’s Way</i>—Morning Pages, Artist Dates, and
            Walks—are refreshed and reintroduced, to provide a proven, grounded
            framework for growth and development. <br /><br />Additionally,
            Cameron introduces a fourth tool, Writing Out Guidance. She believes
            this powerful practice will greatly aid aspiring artists.
            <br /><br /><i>Seeking Wisdom</i> issues an invitation to step
            further into exciting creative practice.

          <b>Praise for Seeking Wisdom: </b><br /><br />In
          <i>Seeking Wisdom,</i> the prolific Julia Cameron continues her work
          as a masterful guide, offering a path of creative recovery by asking
          us to personalize our sense of God through our own intimate practice
          of prayer. Both <b>grounded and innovative</b>, this book casts
          writing as praying on the page to everything larger than us. Bring
          your whole self to the journey of this book and you will touch the
          eternal link between creativity and spirituality.
          <b>This book will help you come alive</b>. It will help you play your
          instrument and sing your song.<br /><br />—Mark Nepo, author of
          <i>The Book of Soul </i>and<i> Finding Inner Courage</i
          ><br /><br />"Julia Cameron’s new book, <i>Seeking Wisdom</i>, carries
          on the author’s tradition of magically changing lives, hearts, habits
          and attitudes. Julia writes about her own life and about writing and
          living and in this six-week guide to contemplation, prayer and seeking
          the living presence, Julia does again what she has done since writing
          the Artist’s Way—<b
            >she leads us into the real questions and answers that lie in our
            path </b
          >and points to contemplation of the Higher Power in our creative inner
          lives and points us to the spiritual approach--prayer, work, writing,
          and living. A master of her craft of giving to others what her inner
          guides have taught her, I promise you will come away from reading her
          new book, as I did, with renewed creative zest and energy, as well as
          insight into your own spiritual possibilities as a creative person.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> as “The Queen of Change,” JULIA
          CAMERON is credited with starting a movement in 1992 that has brought
          creativity into the mainstream conversation—in the arts, in business,
          and in everyday life. She is the best-selling author of more than
          forty books, fiction and nonfiction; a poet, songwriter, filmmaker and
          playwright. Commonly referred to as “The Godmother” or “High
          Priestess” of creativity, her tools are based in practice, not theory,
          and she considers herself “the floor sample of her own toolkit.”
          <i>The Artist’s Way </i>has been translated into forty languages and
          sold over five million copies to date.
