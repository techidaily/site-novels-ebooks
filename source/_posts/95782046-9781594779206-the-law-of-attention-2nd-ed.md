          How to achieve a direct inner experience of your higher nature and the
          after-death state from which you originate and will return <br />
          <br />• Provides techniques for listening to the primordial sound
          within <br />
          <br />• Offers yoga and meditation techniques that are still little
          known in the West <br />
          <br />This book--at once simple and powerful--stands as a monument to
          the lifelong spiritual struggles of Edward Salim Michael, struggles
          that he heroically surmounted on his path to enlightenment. Due to the
          circumstances of his birth, Michael had no education, no mother
          tongue, and no book learning when he was drafted at the age of 19 into
          the British Royal Air Force during World War II. After learning to
          read and write he became an accomplished classical composer in France.
          In 1949, after seeing a statue of a Buddha for the first time, he
          experienced a powerful awakening of his innate Buddha Nature, which
          inspired him to begin a sustained and extremely disciplined meditation
          practice. Michael abandoned his career as a composer and went to
          India, the home of his maternal grandmother, where he lived for seven
          years fully focused on his spiritual awakening. <br />
          <br />Michael’s spiritual teachings reveal techniques of yoga and
          meditation that can open the door to one’s higher nature and to
          directly experience the after-death state. Nada yoga (meditation on
          the inner sound) is one of the core techniques for this realization.
          There is a vast luminous consciousness already within us, but it is
          obscured by the clouds of our incessant thoughts. With sincerity,
          moral integrity, and inner vigilance, which, when embodied, implies
          that we have internalized the basic tenets of the law of attention, we
          can move beyond the promptings of our lower nature and break through
          the clouds of our ordinary mind to realize our own divine nature.
          Emphasizing inner attention and an awareness of attitude, Michael’s
          practices can help aspirants make direct contact with the divine
          source each of us unknowingly carries deep within.

          “This fine book offers, without doubt, the clearest and most
          comprehensive description of ‘Nada Yoga’ (meditation on the inner
          sound) that is available in the English language. This is a practice
          that is known in Vedic, Buddhist, and other traditions to be a
          powerful and liberating spiritual discipline and is also one that I
          have used for more than 25 years, to great benefit.”
