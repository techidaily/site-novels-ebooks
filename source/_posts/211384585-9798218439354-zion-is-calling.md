              Word with the powerful healing effects of music. You are invited
              on a journey to a more intimate relationship with God and you as
              you embrace His love for the whole you. By engaging in the
              therapeutic power of music, each day's song represents a topic
              where God calls you into the deep with Him through worship, Bible
              study, reflection, and prayer. Take the journey to purify your
              heart and experience a deeper dimension of God's love and healing
              power.&nbsp;</span

            >Have you ever felt stuck? Did you want to draw closer to God but
            you could not understand how to get there? "Zion Is Calling" unlocks
            the process and takes you through the journey of connecting with our
            Father by revealing the importance of worship, the study of the Word
            and the posture of our hearts. This devotional brought me to a place
            of becoming comfortable with the uncomfortable; confronting and
            addressing the issues of my heart while still experiencing God's
            love and grace through the songs and the words written. It truly
            tugs at your heart to draw closer to God and allow Him to heal the
            brokenness within.&nbsp;</span

            >"Zion Is Calling" is the devotional that I did not know that I
            needed. When I was contacted by the author to edit and produce the
            book, I realized how precious this "cargo" was that I was asked to
            handle. I am grateful, and I am forever challenged and changed by
            the pages of this devotional.&nbsp;</span

            >This devotional is like none other. As I read it, I entered into a
            place of rest and felt all anxiety leave my body. I faced 3 abrupt
            shifts - personally, financially and mentally. It was so devastating
            and hard to stay in the faith that I contemplated taking my
            life.&nbsp;</span

            >"Zion Is Calling" allows you to experience God's manifestation of
            promises as you rest and lean on the Father. Although I had to start
            over, I was assured that I would not do it on my own because the
            Lord loves me and equips me with everything that I need. In this
            season, this devotional not only was the shield for my mind, but it
            stopped me from quitting because I remembered what God said. I pray
            that this blesses you and transforms your way of knowing God like it
            did for me.</span

            you release your anxieties, hurt, pain, and all of life's challenges
            to Him. I was encouraged to invite God into the hidden parts of my
            heart and allow Him to do a new work in me. I began repairing what
            was once lost with this renewed partnership with Him.</span
