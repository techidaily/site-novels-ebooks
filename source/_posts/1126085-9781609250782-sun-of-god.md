          <p>
            In <i>Sun of gOd</i>, cultural pioneer and philosopher Gregory Sams
            takes a fresh look at our solar benefactor. As Sams sees it cultures
            throughout the ancient world were right to recognize the Sun as a
            living, conscious being. The implications of a conscious provider in
            the sky are startling, though often obvious and in harmony with
            science, logic and common sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Sun of gOd</i> explores exciting new ground, adding a crucial
            piece to the jigsawpuzzle picture we have of the cosmos. In the
            light of a conscious Sun, Sams looks at our hardwired tendency for
            religion, notions of god and divinity, our place in the firmament,
            star formation, intelligent light, electromagnetism, feedback, chaos
            theory, free will, the four elements, and the nearuniversal
            selforganization of systems from the bottom up.
          </p>
          <p>
            "Could it really be that the universe waited 13.7 billion years
            until we came along to manifest the phenomenon of consciousness and
            made ours the only type of vessel able to experience it?" Sams
            thinks not. Citing David Bohm's discovery that even on the subatomic
            level of electrons there appears to be intention and choice, Sams
            goes on to suggest that creative intelligence may be a botÂ¬tomup
            system in which "everything, from a molecule of water to a neuron in
            our brain to the Sun itself, is a part of the bottom that is subtly
            steering a greater whole." From this perspective, he smoothly joins
            the microcosm to the macrocosm, revealing a Universe incorporating
            both intelligence and design, with no need for an Intelligent
            Designer.

          "<i>Sun of gOd</i> presents a perfectly outrageous hypothesis: The sun
          is a conscious, living organism residing in a thriving galactic
          community, thinking stellar thoughts that span the entire universe.
          Surely this is nonsense. Except that the more you read the more a
          conscious universe begins to make sense. Gregory Sams' book is a
          clearly written and persuasively reasoned argument to think about the
          sun in a radically new and refreshing way." -Dean Radin, PhD, Senior
          Scientist, Institute of Noetic Sciences

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Gregory Sams</b> has been changing the culture from the age of 19,
          when he cofounded SEED, the UK's first natural and organic restaurant
          in 1960's London. It led to Ceres Grain store, where customers could
          buy these foods to cook at home. Within a few years he had created the
          nation's first natural and organic food enterprises, including Whole
          Earth Foods. He was founder publisher of Harmony Magazine, to which
          John Lennon dedicated an eightframe cartoon, and copublished Seed, the
          Journal of Organic Living. In 1982 he created and christened the
          original VegeBurger, initiating the market for vegetarian food. In
          1990 he founded Strange Attractions, the world's only shop ever
          dedicated to new science "chaos theory." His interest in that science
          planted the seeds of this book in Gregory's mind. Visit Sams at
          gregorysams.com. He lives in London.<br /><br /><b>Graham Hancock</b>
          is the author of the international bestsellers
          <i>The Sign and The Seal, Fingerprints of the Gods,</i> and
          <i>Heaven's Mirror</i>. His books have sold more than five million
          copies.
