          A fascinating book on Symbolism and Astrology of Freemasonry first
          published in 1923.<br /><br />“Away back in 1887, when the city of
          Alpena was located in the heart of one of the lumber districts of
          Michigan, Hopper Lodge, U. D. (now No. 386), of that city was pleased
          to honor me with membership in due and ancient form.<br /><br />“In
          those days, or at least in that Lodge, there was no horseplay; and I
          was so impressed with the work that I resolved to master all the
          lectures, which I did. The part which interested me the most was the
          one which I could learn the least about. I would have sacrificed a
          five-dollar note to learn why Pythagoras sacrificed a hecatomb, and
          would have given as much to anyone who would explain the mystery
          surrounding the 47th Problem of Euclid, as depicted on the lecture
          chart. When inquiry failed me, I made diligent search and finally
          discovered the KEY OF THE HOUSE OF DAVID, through the knowledge of
          which I was enabled to penetrate the allegorical veil, just as
          Pythagoras did five hundred years before the Christian era.<br /><br />“On
          the night of my initiation I was told that Freemasonry was founded on
          the Bible, and all its secrets were hidden therein. In my research
          work I discovered that the true secrets of Freemasonry were written in
          the stars and the book of nature, and a knowledge of astronomy and
          astrology was necessary to lift the allegorical veil. Upon obtaining
          this knowledge I discovered that the Bible was founded upon the same
          law as Freemasonry, i.e., the stars and the book of nature.”—Author’s
          Foreword
