          A step-by-step guide to the rituals of Enochian magic for reaching the
          higher spiritual realms <br />
          <br />• Reveals missing practical instructions for the Enochian magic
          system received by John Dee and Edward Kelley <br />
          <br />• Explains that the angelic realm is only the first and farthest
          away of the spiritual realms surrounding God <br />
          <br />• Shows how to connect with the higher worlds beyond the angels
          to tap more fully in to the magical power of the Divine <br />
          <br />In this comprehensive introduction to Enochian magic and beyond,
          John DeSalvo explains how the magic system transmitted by the angels
          to John Dee and Edward Kelley in the 16th century has until now
          remained incomplete and thus not as powerful as the angels intended.
          <br />
          <br />Drawing on his in-depth study of John Dee’s diaries, DeSalvo
          explains how Dee and Kelley were given the Enochian tables and calls
          but their communications with the angels were severed before they
          received the full practical instructions for Enochian magic. To this
          day, most magical groups improvise and make up rituals based on their
          own ideas and imagination--the magic they practice is not true angelic
          magic. <br />
          <br />After many successful Enochian magic rituals and years of his
          own spiritual work, DeSalvo has discovered additional key pieces to
          the magical system of Dee and Kelley, a system now known as Power
          Magic. He provides step-by-step instructions for more complete and
          accurate Enochian magic rituals and reveals how the angelic realm is
          only the first and farthest away of the spiritual realms surrounding
          God. He explains how to penetrate this angelic realm with Power Magic
          to reach higher spiritual worlds and receive more powerful knowledge
          and energy. He shows that by connecting with the higher worlds beyond
          the angels, we can tap more fully in to the magical power of the
          Divine and begin restoring the planetary magic of our most ancient
          ancestors.
