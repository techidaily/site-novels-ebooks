          What is it about fairies that enchants us so? Where do these elusive
          beings live, and what do they do? Why is it some see fairies and
          others do not? What's the truth about glamour? And why when they
          promise your dreams will come true, do fairies grant
          <i>threewishes</i>? <br /><br /><b>Maggie Hamilton</b> has spent a
          decade exploring the rich world of the fairy. Having talked with
          people from all walks of life, she captures their astonishing,
          sometimes poignant encounters with fairies here. Read about the
          fairies found in people's homes and gardens, deep in nature, and in
          city streets and parks. <br /><br />On this <i>mesmerising</i> journey
          deep into this achingly beautiful <i>otherworld</i>, you'll discover
          the many exquisite possibilities present at dawn and dusk, and why the
          fairy kingdom has an ecology all of its own. Learn about the notes
          plants sound, and why some indigenous peoples no longer need to pick a
          plant to access its healing properties. Find out how to work with
          fairies to heal the earth and your own bruised spirit, and how this
          quest can transform you inside and out. <br /><br /><i

          ‘Maggie Hamilton guides us, with an expert’s touch, into the rich and
          remarkably complex world of fairies. Her own stories, and those of
          many others who have come forward to share their experiences of these
          tiny beings, makes for fascinating reading. As if I was being guided
          through a beautiful meditation, the book opened my eyes and heart to
          the other lives that are all around us if only we take the time to
          look. Once you’ve read&nbsp;<i>Inside the Life of Fairies</i>, you’ll
          never see the world in quite the same way again!’&nbsp;<br /><b
            >—Candida Baker</b
          >
          MA, President Equus Alliance, Australia<br /><br />‘This beautifully
          written book took my right back to the halcyon days of my childhood in
          the beautiful Yorkshire Dales, when summer was endless, and time stood
          still. Maggie reawakens the magic and wonder of nature and transported
          me through true stories of people who see through the mists of
          reality, into those time-honoured spaces where fairies and the little
          people truly exist in their own world, creating harmony and magic. She
          has awakened the part of me that once again appreciates the wonder of
          natural spaces, where the fairies work so hard to nurture, the scent
          of the blossom so carefully tended by them, and the sweet song of the
          blackbird as I walk through the woods and touch the warm, soft bark of
          the trees, and my heart bursts with love. This is an incredibly
          uplifting book, for both young and old, reminding us that wherever we
          may be, the fairies are always amongst us bringing their sparkles and
          luminous experiences just waiting to touch our hearts and minds.’<br /><b
            >—Heather Hoyland</b
          >, spiritual medium, Yorkshire, England<br />&nbsp;<br />‘This
          enchanting book took me on a wonderful journey into the life of
          fairies. I must say that since reading it, not a day has gone by
          without me having a new, inspiring thought about it. I love trees so
          ‘The Miracle of Trees’ chapter certainly made me think quite
          differently about the trees around me and their tiny inhabit-ants. I
          often pick up pebbles and stones just to ‘feel’ them, so to read
          ‘rocks and stones sit silently among us, preciously guarding their
          memories of people and events long gone’ really resonated with me. A
          truly magical and compelling read.’<br /><b>—Wendy Nute</b>, Halwyn
          Holistics, Snell’s Beach, New Zealand.<br /><br />‘If your mind is
          open to explore the world of Faeries this book offers many aspects of
          the unknown. Possibly opening your mind and heart to past unexplained
          encounters and put you on the path to invite the Faeries into your
          future life.’<br /><b>—Lynda Collier</b>, Collier’s Crystals and
          Gifts, Blue Mountains, Australia

          Zealand, Holland, Italy, China, Lithuania, Korea, the Arab States and
          Brazil. Her travels have taken her to deserts and sacred mountains, to

          writing, teaching and mentoring, and to her own spiritual practice.
