            spiritual teachers of all time and the Master Sages of the Universe?

          ><br />In this awe-inspiring book based on a live event in Anaheim,
          California, <b>Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</b> sits down with
          <b>Esther Hicks</b> and the wise Collective Consciousness known as
          <b>Abraham</b>. Wayne asks all the questions he has accumulated from
          his more than 40 years of teaching others about self-reliance and
          self-discovery, and Abraham delivers the answers we all need to hear.
          Topics include:<br /><br />· Parenting, parents, and the continuum of
          life<br />· Can we reach the state of "love that has no opposite"?<br />·
          Dharma, destiny, and being on your path<br />· Dealing with bad
          news<br />·&nbsp;Are there ascended masters and guides?<br />·
          Monsanto and GMOs<br />· and many more!<br /><br />While Wayne and
          Esther have been friends for years, this is the first time that he
          engages with Abraham in an extended dialogue about life’s many lessons
          and perplexing questions. Read this book and experience this
          extraordinary meeting of the minds for yourself!

        </h4>
        <p>
          Affectionately called the "father of motivation" by his fans, Dr.
          Wayne W. Dyer was an internationally renowned author, speaker, and
          pioneer in the field of self-development. Over the four decades of his
          career, he wrote more than 40 books (21 of which became New York Times
          bestsellers), created numerous audio programs and videos, and appeared
          on thousands of television and radio shows. His books Manifest Your
          Destiny, Wisdom of the Ages, There’s a Spiritual Solution to Every
          Problem, and the New York Times bestsellers 10 Secrets for Success and
          Inner Peace, The Power of Intention, Inspiration, Change Your
          Thoughts—Change Your Life, Excuses Begone!, Wishes Fulfilled, and I
          Can See Clearly Now were all featured as National Public Television
          specials. Wayne held a doctorate in educational counseling from Wayne
          State University, had been an associate professor at St. John’s
          University in New York, and honored a lifetime commitment to learning
          and finding the Higher Self. In 2015, he left his body, returning to
          Infinite Source to embark on his next adventure. Website:
