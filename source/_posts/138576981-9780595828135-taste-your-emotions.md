          Taste Your Emotions ~unplugged~This is the second revised and expanded
          version of the earlier work Taste Your Emotions a book containing
          poems only each telling a story of the struggle for physical,
          emotional, and spiritual sobriety. The poems inside this book express
          a variety of emotions taking you through an experience from deep pain
          to the joy of emotional freedom. Attempting to balance between a short
          memoir written in a creative way, self-help book of sorts, as well as
          grouped enlightened writing trying to lead others in embarking of self
          freedom. Thus this book is simply not a book of poems and writings it
          is a dark journey of pain, confusion and addiction leading to a bright
          awakening of the heart and mind. The poems and writing are both heavy,
          raw, thought provoking, even forceful in there convictions at times
          and they are also light and touching in there innocence at other
          times, culminating in a moving expression of strength and
          determination. You will not just read these poems and writings you
          will experience them think about them, be moved by them and maybe if I
          am lucky even be some what changed by them. What was changed from the
          first edition was some poems of lesser relevance where removed. More
          back ground to the author his life and experiences behind the poems
          was added which makes the read much richer and deeply connecting.
          Likewise there is added writing on the thinking and philosophies which
          brought about his ever evolving and life enriching change. One mantra
          he lives by now which he created is: KNOW yourself, LOVE yourself,
          &amp; BE yourself.Comments from Past readers:Well-organized and
          powerful/life-affirming works ~ Chris MasseyA compilation of life's
          struggles and victories ~ Timothy TalosiFascinating Read ~ Pat
          SturtThe poems are very emotional, touching to the heart ~ Tonya
          GrahamThe title is right on. As I read this book I experienced deep
          feelings and emotions. Most books don't touch my soul the way this one
          does ~ Becky Sedgwick
