          With the planet increasingly threatened with catastrophe and perhaps
          even collapse, many seekers are looking to past, proven models to
          create meaningful change in their lives. One such model is Buddhism’s
          Four Noble Truths: the reality of&nbsp;suffering, the root cause of
          suffering, the end of suffering, and the path to the end of suffering.
          This fresh, timely book taps and modifies that ancient wisdom to
          address the pressing environmental and spiritual crises facing us.
          <br /><br />In <i>The Four Global Truths, </i>author Darrin Drda
          contends that as global temperatures rise and natural systems decline,
          humanity is forced to confront the destructiveness of unfettered
          material progress and mechanistic thinking. He posits a more
          enlightened worldview that honors the interdependence of all forms of
          life and aspects of reality, a concept increasingly see as a practical
          and compassionate approach to averting disaster. Writing in a warm,
          open style recalling that of Eckhart Tolle in <i>The</i>
          <i>New Earth, </i>Drda integrates elements of Western philosophy,
          transpersonal psychology, deep ecology, modern cosmology, and quantum
          physics to get at the heart of worldwide ecological suffering. In the
          process he encourages a responsible and joyful—and ultimately
          healing—participation in this critical moment in life.<br /><br /><b

          “In a brilliantly appropriate application of the Buddha’s fourfold
          Truths, Darrin Drda provides a conceptual structure for perceiving
          both the peril and promise of this planetary moment. He also shows us
          how to play with this structure, climbing around on it with
          uninhibited curiosity, and exploring ways to integrate the darkness
          and the light, the failures and the hopes that taunt and lure this
          evolving human animal. The book brings such a rich cargo of
          companionable inquiry and inspiration, I want to see it in every book
          bag and backpack. I love to think of the hands it will fall into, the
          minds it will ignite, the hearts it will embolden, so that this great
          adventure may continue!”<br />
          —Joanna Macy, PhD, author of <i>World As Lover, World As Self</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “With a warm and open writing style, and drawing from his extensive
          knowledge of Buddhism and the ecological state of the planet, Darrin
          Drda gives expression to some of the noble possibilities of human
          consciousness. <i>The Four Global Truths</i> is destined to become an
          essential part of the ongoing illumination of this wild, groping,
          confused, but ultimately beautiful human species.”<br />
          —Brian Swimme, professor of Cosmology, California Institute of
          Integral Studies<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In his remarkable new book, <i>The Four Global Truths,</i> author
          Darrin Drda potently examines the challenging situation that humanity
          has created for itself at this time in history, a perspective that is
          greatly enriched by his accessible understanding of cosmology,
          ecology, philosophy, and cultural history. This book allows us to see
          that humanity's current condition is in fact, a larger-scale
          manifestation of the Buddha’s Four Noble Truths and that the Buddha
          knew that we are in a dream of attachment, and that we need to wake up
          and free ourselves from this dream that is robbing us of our true
          capacity as human beings. Fortunately, the Buddha offered a path to
          liberation, one that is now possible for humanity as well. This
          magnificent book powerfully invites us to choose that path.”<br />
          —Lynne Twist, author of <i>The Soul of Money </i>and cofounder of The
          Pachamama Alliance<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Informed by leading-edge consciousness studies and new paradigm
          thinking, <i>The Four Global Truths</i> is a creative re-visioning of
          dharma for the planetary era. Packing the pages with fascinating
          details, Drda nevertheless keeps his eye (and heart) on the Big
          Picture. He helps us see the grand lines of our collective evolution,
          uncovering the path that has led to our troubled present, and
          illuminating a possible, but by no means certain, way forward.”<br />
          —Sean Kelly, author of
          <i>Coming Home: The Birth and Transformation of the Planetary Era</i
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “In a style at once urgent, witty, and poignant,
          <i>The Four Global Truths</i> gives us a fresh, insightful, and
          nuanced polemic on global turmoil and its transformation. Darrin Drda
          has done us a great service by bringing together the best in
          consciousness studies and fresh perspectives on ancient Buddhist
          insights. This is a treasure mine of information and resources for
          changing the status quo—highly recommended.”<br />
          —Steven Goodman, professor of Asian and Comparative Studies,
          California Institute of Integral Studies<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>“The Four Global Truths</i> is a unique take on the central
          questions that face humanity at this moment. Fusing ancient Buddhist
          teaching and contemporary ecology, Drda uses the Buddha’s Four Noble
          Truths as a model for addressing the crisis of modernity.
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; “Working from the assumption that the
          solution to myriad problems, particularly the ecological crisis,
          requires a new worldview, Drda uses Buddhist teaching to work toward a
          new way of relating to the world. The genius of his work is that he
          takes teachings largely understood in terms of individual process and
          applies them to the entire planet. Drda's creative process is
          revelatory: the solution is found in the integration of the personal
          and the global, the removal of barriers between our isolated,
          individualistic selves and the planet as a whole.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp; “Perhaps most impressive is Drda's ability to discuss
          extraordinarily complex subject matter in an accessible, clear, and
          inviting tone. Whether one is interested in learning a modern take on
          Buddhist practice or addressing some of the world’s most severe
          crises, <i>The Four Global Truths</i> is highly recommended.”<br />
