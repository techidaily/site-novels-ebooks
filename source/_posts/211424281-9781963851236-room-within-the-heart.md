            Room Within the Heart is a non-fiction novel that encapsulates the
            literal and metaphorical thoughts of our hearts. It emphasizes how
            our heart bears love and consciously thinks within the deepest
            innermost of our being. The book expresses how the thoughts we
            conceive are amplified in how we live and in our interactions. What
            the heart feels always shines through; therefore, we cannot truly
            hide what is resonating inside, realize that "out of the abundance
            of the heart, the mouth speaks" (Luke 6:45). It is very true that "a
            merry heart makes a cheerful countenance" ... (Prov 15:13), and "a
            merry heart doeth good like a medicine" ... (Prov 17:22). Room
            within the Heart illuminates our secret place that houses our
            desires, our passions, our pain, our will, our treasures, and our
            love. Hate does not come from within because we are born in pure
            innocence; it is derived or taught by external forces that become
            webbed in the mind.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The words are meant to encourage the thoughts we generate to be more
            purified, humbled, and cleansed from revulsion and animosity; to
            bring us all into remembrance that love lives within a warm
            environment and wants to embrace everyone. The more we connect with
            others with a heart like Christ, our connection influences His love
            to take root and flourish. Love increases our wisdom and helps us to
            realize we are truly striving to become better. Like marriage makes
            a man and woman one, so when we are married to Christ, we all become
            one body in Him.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Room within the Heart is intended to stimulate our pulse of love and
            as we recognize and amplify the precious Holy Spirit, His light
            fills our brokenness and removes our darkness. The Holy Spirit wants
            to be invited into our inner core and take residence there. As a
            little girl, I loved this song we sang often at St. Paul's Episcopal
            Church Sunday School, "There is a flag flowing high from the castle
            of my heart and the King is a residence there" (author unknown).
            When we allow it to shine through us, we become the pulse of God's
            love. We are His endless love; His spirit encircles us and emanates
            peace.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            I pray each person reading these words feels the peace of God
            flowing as they are touched. I pray your heart is on fire for Him
            and you allow Him to take the lead from within the innermost core,
            your HEART.
