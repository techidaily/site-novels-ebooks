            >A road map for people who think they may be psychic—and their loved
            ones</b
          >&nbsp;<i>Are You Psychic or Making It Up?</i>&nbsp;is a must-have
          book for anyone who is having psychic or mediumistic experiences (and
          possibly thinks they’re going crazy) and their friends and families.
          Carole Lynne begins with some badly needed truths. Chief among them:
          not everyone is psychic. While everyone can develop their intuition
          and get in touch with the inner psychic voice, those who are psychic
          and mediumistic have received special spiritual gifts. If that sounds
          familiar, this is definitely the book for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn how to
          take care of your “extra sensitive self.” Learn how to evaluate your
          experiences and to make choices about whether to further develop your
          gifts. Get advice on what type of further training and study you might
          benefit most from. And, for friends and families, learn to appreciate
          your psychic loved ones and that it is an honor to be
          psychic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Carole Lynne writes from authority earned over
          decades of personal experience and study, teaching, and working with
          clients, many of whom come to her for mediumistic readings. Others
          come to her to learn how to develop their own psychic and mediumistic
          powers. It is those people and the thousands more like them who will
          benefit from this book.&nbsp;<br />

          “I truly enjoyed reading this book. I personally have spent years
          distrusting my own intuitive gifts and have found that when I merged
          the mystical part of myself with my more skeptical, scientific side,
          not only did my work as a doctor, teacher and author improve, but so
          did my personal life. Carole Lynn shows you how to merge the worlds in
          a beautiful and light way, offering you tools that will help you trust
          your experiences, dig deeper within yourself, and find the real truth
          hidden within your mystical gift.” —<b>Eva Selhub, MD</b>, author
