            “The story of Steve Ford's realisation is unusual. One night in his
            room in 1999 there was a total falling away of all identification as
            the personal self. It was unusual in the sense that Steve had no
            prior experience of spiritual seeking. He had neither teacher nor
            guru, no paradigm which would explain what had happened. All
            vestiges of personality were suddenly gone, there was direct and
            immediate seeing as and from no-thing, from the absolute. Such
            accounts exist within the spiritual literature and in each case
            there appears to follow a period of relative dysfunctionality and
            subsequent reintegration such that what has happened may be
            understood and conveyed within the world of form. In Steve's case
            this took the form of an exhaustive investigation in consciousness
            which he eventually came to refer to as The Living Process. He
            explains that realisation is just the beginning and unless
            subsequent investigation into the nature of consciousness takes
            place there is re-identification and consequently self-orientation
            around no-thing. Many contemporary teachers and their students
            relate in this way. So what follows in this introductory book is the
            story of Steve's early life, his realisation, enquiry and
            integration in consciousness, and some interactions that have taken
            place with some of those who have made their way to be with Steve."

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Steve Ford</b> grew up in England in a hard-working family which
          had no interest in religion. When he was 18, his world was suddenly
          rocked by the revelation that the man he’d known all his life as his
          father was not, in fact, his biological father. With his whole
          identity called into question, he spent the next ten years attempting
          to submerge his doubts and confusion in alcohol. By the age of 27, he
          was a recovering alcoholic. Intent on finding an honesty that would
          propel him into a more productive direction, he spent the next three
          and a half years engaged in an examination of every aspect of his
          so-called "self."<br /><br />
          One night in his room in 1999, there was a total falling away of all
          identification as the personal self. All vestiges of personality were
          suddenly gone, and there was direct and immediate seeing as and from
          no-thing, from the absolute. This was particularly unusual in that
          Steve had had no prior experience of spiritual seeking, neither
          teacher nor guru, no paradigm which would explain what had
          happened.<br /><br />
          Such accounts exist within spiritual literature, and in each case
          there appears to follow a period of relative dysfunctionality and
          subsequent reintegration, such that what has happened may be
          understood and conveyed within the world of form. In Steve’s case this
          took the form of an exhaustive investigation in consciousness which he
          eventually came to refer to as The Living Process. He explains that
          realization is just the beginning and, unless subsequent investigation
          into the nature of consciousness takes place, there is
          re-identification and consequently self-orientation around
          no-thing.<br /><br />
          Today Steve holds contemplative meetings and retreats in Bristol and
          the South of England which reflect his grounding in non-dual reality.
