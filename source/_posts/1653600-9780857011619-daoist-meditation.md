            Master Cherng's translation of Discourse on Sitting and Forgetting,
            an 8th century classic text on meditation by Si Ma Cheng Zhen, is
            accompanied by his extensive explanatory commentary, unique in its
            ability to make this complex text accessible to the Western
            reader.<br /><br />In the introduction to the text, Master Cherng
            explains how to practice the Purification of the Heart method of
            meditation and photographs clearly illustrate the correct postures.
            He deciphers the Chinese metaphors and abstract language of Si Ma
            Cheng Zhen to give a clear explanation of the processes involved and
            the resulting changes to mind, spirit and body. His translation and
            explanatory commentary present the classic text in a way that can be
            easily understood and applied, allowing Western students of Daoism,
            and anyone with an interest in meditation, direct access to the
            meaning of this text in practice.

          In Daoist Meditation, Master Wu Jyh Cherng guides us through the Seven
          Steps of Obtaining the Dao as taught by Master SiMa ChengZhen (647–735
          CE), renowned ancestral master of the Daoist TianTai ShangQing
          tradition. Master SiMa's pivotal work, ZuoWangLun, is one of the most
          important Daoist internal alchemy classics ever written. It is our
          great fortune that Master Wu Jyh Cherng's translation and insightful
          commentary of this historical work - the one that marked the shift
          away from external alchemy and towards internal alchemical processes –
          has brought this practice back to life. Daoist Meditation is an
          essential addition to the library of any serious student of authentic
          Daoist internal cultivation practices.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Wu Jyh Cherng (1958-2004), was a Taoist High Priest and Master of
          Meditation, Rites and Ceremonies. He was born in Taiwan, Republic of
          China, and moved with his parents to Rio de Janeiro in 1973. His first
          contact with Chinese Medicine, Oriental Arts and Meditation was with
          his father, Wu Chao Hsiang, a physician in Taiwan and Master in Tài Jí
          Quán (Tai Chi Chuan). He furthered his education in acupuncture,
          philosophy, science, art and mysticism with regular visits to the Far
          East, where he was ordained as a priest by the World Central Committee
          of Taoism based in Taiwan. In 1991 he founded the Taoist Society of
          Brazil, in Rio de Janeiro, and acted as its first regent master.
          Master Cherng spread the Taoist doctrine of the Orthodox Unitary Order
          and passed on his knowledge of this Tradition to his disciples and
          followers. He translated Taoist texts into Portuguese, such as the Tao
          Te Ching, The Book of the Path and Virtue, by Lao Tse. He also wrote
          several books, such as, I Ching – The Alchemy of Numbers, Tai Chi
          Chuan - The Alchemy of Movements and Initiation to Taoism (volumes I
          and II).
