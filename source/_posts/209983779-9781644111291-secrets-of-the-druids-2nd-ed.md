          A guide to the history and practices of the Druids and the Celtic
          faith <br /><br />• Reconstructs the Druidic faith from surviving
          remnants, parallels with other Indo-European traditions, and dedicated
          study of scholarly sources <br /><br />• Details magical rites and
          ceremonies, methods for consecrating an outdoor temple, and customs
          for celebrating important festivals such as Beltaine and Samhain
          <br /><br />• Discusses rules for firecraft, making offerings to
          deities and spirits, and the ancient Coligny calendar, including the
          names of the months in old Gaulish <br /><br />Druids and their magic,
          lore, and rituals have fascinated all those who encounter them, from
          the ancient Greeks and Romans onward. Even today, the mere mention of
          their name evokes pictures of standing stones, mistletoe, golden
          sickles, white-robed priests, and powerful sorcerers. But were they
          really as we picture them? <br /><br />Drawing on comparative
          mythology and linguistics, archaeological evidence, and etymology,
          Teresa Cross offers readers a comprehensive course in the history and
          development of the Celtic spiritual tradition and its lore,
          reconstructing the Druidic faith from the remnants that have survived
          and dedicated study of scholarly sources. She also reveals parallels
          with other Indo-European traditions, such as the similarities between
          Celtic and Vedic Hindu beliefs and practices. She chronicles the
          ethics and spiritual teachings of Druidism and the Celtic faith and
          examines what happened to these beliefs during centuries of
          Christianization. <br /><br />Moving from history to practice, Cross
          details magical rites and ceremonies as practiced by modern-day
          followers of Druidactos. She explores the structure of the
          <i>Touta</i>, which roughly corresponds to “tribe,” methods for
          consecrating a nemeton, the outdoor temple that offers the optimum
          sacred space for the meeting of heaven and earth, and the rites and
          customs associated with important festivals such as Beltaine and
          Samhain. She also explores the rules of firecraft, the sacred art of
          giving to the cosmos, making offerings to deities and spirits, sacred
          food and beverages, and the ancient Coligny calendar, including the
          names of the months in old Gaulish. <br /><br />Offering an authentic
          handbook for starting your own Celtic group led by Druids, Cross
          reveals the meanings and metaphysics behind the Celtic and Druidic
          customs and traditions, reuniting the fragmentary remains of long-lost
          Druid culture with the still-living practices of the Celtic faith.
