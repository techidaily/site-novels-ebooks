          <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The book takes the form of a
          discussion between two lively,outspoken women with very different
          viewpoints and life experiences. We ask an important question, whether
          God is necessary, and answer it with reference to scriptures,
          politics, feminism, secularisation and the serious financial and
          environmental issues which now confront us and which can no longer be
          ignored. These days, most educated people - men and women - take the
          attitude that God and religion are outdated and belong only to
          fundamentalism and the bible belt. We pull no punches, ask all the
          awkward questions and try to find satisfying answers. <br /><br />Liz
          Hodgkinson, a well-known journalist and author of many controversial
          books, asks the questions, and Sister Jayanti, who has dedicated her
          life to spirituality, provides the answers. But sometimes, the answers
          throw up more questions, and we answer these as well. Liz Hodgkinson
          takes the devils advocate standpoint, and we hope that by so doing,
          many of the most pressing and urgent questions about morality and
          ethics which most trouble people today will be addressed. <br />,

          <span>About the Author</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Liz Hodgkinson is a prolific author and journalist. She was educated
          at Newcastle University and started her career on local newspapers in
          the North East. She progressed to writing for a variety of tabloid
          newspapers in the UK and progressed to so-called quality newspapers
          before becoming a full-time author and freelance writer. Her fourth
          book, Sex is Not Compulsory, was a succes de scandale in 1986 and was
          published in many languages. She has written on health, relationships,
          property and lifestyle issues, always at the cutting edge. She always
          thinks she is five years ahead of her time! More recently, she has
          written about pioneer women in Fleet Street and her latest book, Alex
          Williams: The Survival of an Artist, is to be published by Quartet
          Books in Spring 2012. Her biography of the first woman to have a
          sex-change operation to live as a man, Michael, nee Laura, is now in
          development as a major motion picture, as they say. Liz is known for
          her clear, humorous style of writing and frequently writes amusing
          articles in the Daily Mail, Guardian, Times and other outlets.
          <br /><br />Sister Jayanti was born in India but educated at an
          English grammar school and university. Originally training to be a
          pharmacist, she chose instead to dedicate her life to spirituality,
          and is now the UK director of the Brahma Kumaris, the only spiritual
          organisation of any significance to be led by women. Jayanti is in
          demand as a speaker all over the world, and is known for her clear
          intelligence and ability to answer any awkward questions that may
          arise from the audience. Liz and Jayanti have been friends and
          colleagues for very many years and although very different from each
          other, have an unusual rapport which comes across in the many public
          platforms they have shared. Liz is divorced. She has two sons, Tom and
          Will Hodgkinson, both well-known writers themselves. Jayanti has
          remained single all her life, in spite of a marriage being arranged
          for her at the age of two. She has been completely dedicated to
          spirituality all her adult life, and is also the author of several
          books on meditation, one published by Penguin in the UK.<br />,
