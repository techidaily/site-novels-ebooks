            >A fascinating discussion of the Michael teachings—an extraordinary
            body of channeled work that addresses the fundamental questions of
            what it means to be human—from an expert Michael channel </b
          ><br /><br />
          "Michael" is a group of souls who teach that we are eternal beings
          journeying from the Tao and back again in an adventure of exploration
          and creativity. Each step along the way, we make choices that shape
          our experience. For example, after committing to a series of
          lifetimes, we choose one of seven roles, or soul types:
          <i>server, priest, artisan, sage, warrior, king,</i> or <i>scholar.</i
          ><br /><br />
          These teachings address many age-old questions, such as "How did we
          become who we are?" "Why are we here?" "Where are we going?" and "How
          does the universe work?" In addition,
          <i>Journey of Your Soul</i> sheds light on the channeling process
          itself, answering questions such as "How does channeling work?" "Why
          do different channels receive conflicting information?" and "What does
          it take to become a channel?" Hoodwin shows us that it is possible,
          and indeed beneficial, to engage all parts of the human consciousness.
          His unique analytical approach to channeling will help readers gain a
          firm intellectual understanding of what is involved.<br /><br />
          In his foreword, Jon Klimo, PhD, author of
          <i
            >Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal
            Sources</i
          >, says, "Shepherd Hoodwin has given us one of the best books to date
          about the phenomenon of channeling. <i>Journey of Your Soul</i> may
          well also be the best of the Michael books due to its clarity,
          thoroughness, and detail, and thanks to the fact that the author, an
          exceptionally clearheaded Michael channel himself, brings real
          integrity and authenticity to our understanding of Michael in
          particular and to the channeling process in general."

          “Michael is the kind of guide whose consciousness is much larger than
          any human’s.… When I read Shepherd Hoodwin’s earlier edition of this
          book, I had already read many Michael books.… But it wasn’t until I
          encountered Hoodwin’s descriptions of the Michael attributes that they
          came alive.”<br />—John Friedlander, coauthor of
          <i>Psychic Psychology: Energy Skills for Life and Relationships</i
          ><br /><br />
          “Shepherd Hoodwin has given us one of the best books to date about the
          phenomenon of channeling. In particular, he has given us a meticulous
          presentation of the information channeled from the source known as
          Michael.… [T]he author, an exceptionally clear-headed Michael channel
          himself, brings real integrity and authenticity to our understanding
          of Michael in particular and to the channeling process in general.”<br />—Jon

          “<i>Journey of Your Soul</i> is easy to read and understand for
          beginners, yet it contains lots of detailed information not found
          anywhere else for the advanced student. It’s an essential source book
          for anyone interested in the Michael teachings.”<br />—Emily Baumbach,
          author of <i>Michael’s Cast of Characters</i><br /><br />"Hoping to
          present channeling and clear up misconceptions of the practice,
