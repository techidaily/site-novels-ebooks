          Susan Shumsky is a successful author in the human potential field. But
          in the 1970s, in India, the Swiss Alps, and elsewhere, she served on
          the personal staff of the most famous guru of the 20th
          century—Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. <br /><br />
          Maharishi died in 2008 at age ninety, but his influence endures
          through the spiritual movement he founded: TM (Transcendental
          Meditation). Other books have been written about him, but this
          spellbinding page-turner offers a rare insider's view of life with the
          guru, including the time the Beatles studied at his feet in Rishikesh,
          India, and wrote dozens of songs under his influence. <br /><br />
          Both inspirational and disturbing, <i>Maharishi and Me</i> illuminates
          Susan's two decades living in Maharishi's ashrams, where she grew from
          a painfully shy teenage seeker into a spiritually aware teacher and
          author. It features behind-the-scenes, myth-busting stories, and over
          100 photos of Maharishi and his celebrity disciples (the Beatles,
          Deepak Chopra, Mia Farrow, Beach Boys, and many more). <br /><br />
          Susan's candid, honest portrayal draws back the curtain on her
          shattering, extreme emotional seesaws of heaven and hell at her guru's
          hands. This compelling, haunting memoir will continue to challenge
          readers long after they turn its last page. It dismantles all previous
          beliefs about the spiritual path and how spiritual masters are
          supposed to behave. <br /><br />
          Susan shares: “Merely by being in his presence, we disciples entered
          an utterly timeless place and rapturous feeling, and, at the same
          time, realized the utter futility and insanity of the mundane world.”
          <br /><br />
          Susan's heartfelt masterwork blends her experiences, exacting
          research, artistically descriptive and humorous writing, emotional
          intelligence, and intensely personal inner exploration into a feast
          for thought and contemplation. Neither starry-eyed nor antagonistic,
          it captures, from a balanced viewpoint, the essence of life in an
          ashram.

          "In 1965 at a Transcendental Meditation introductory lecture I first
          met Ray Manzarek and John Densmore, this was before The Doors, and may
          very well have planted the seeds for our communal creative? mind.
          <i>Maharishi &amp; Me</i> captures a moment in my generation, where we
          turned to this great spiritual master who introduced meditation to the
          entire planet. We should heed his teachings and honor his spirit
          today, now more than ever." <br /><br />—Robby Krieger, guitarist, The
          Doors <br /><br />"I met Maharishi in Rishikesh, India, in 1968 where
          I took some iconic photos of the Beatles. There I learned TM, which
          healed my broken heart, and I found a sense of peace never experienced
          before. Susan Shumsky’s book <i>Maharishi &amp; Me</i> captures that
          time in Rishikesh and tells her emotionally-charged, spellbinding
          story of 22 years of awakening and transformation under Maharishi’s
          tutelage and beyond. For anyone seeking spiritual understanding, I
          highly recommend this book." <br /><br />—Paul Saltzman, bestselling
          author and photographer of <i>The Beatles in India</i
          ><br /><br />"Susan Shumsky’s book <i>Maharishi &amp; Me</i> is a
          powerful exploration of guru and discipleship. Her humor, insight and
          the intimate feeling you receive about their relationship is
          extraordinary. A great read for anyone interested in learning."
          <br /><br />—Lynn V. Andrews, bestselling author,
          <i>Medicine Woman</i> and <i>Jaguar Woman</i><br /><br />"So many
          emotions churned within me as I read <i>Maharishi &amp; Me</i>. In her
          incredibly heartfelt book, Susan Shumsky gives us a glimpse into a
          world that few people have ever experienced. Her graphic descriptions
          portray her awakening consciousness that occurred under Maharishi’s
          guidance and also evoke the tempest that swirled around this iconic
          guru. Fascinating reading from a great writer!" <br /><br />—Denise
          Linn, bestselling author of <i>Sacred Space</i><br /><br />"Riveting!
          An eye-opening, enlightening, first person account of life behind the
          curtain of the TM Movement. I loved it!" <br /><br />— Dr. Joe Vitale,
          bestselling author, <i>The Miracle</i>, and featured in
          <i>The Secret</i><br /><br />"Maharishi Mahesh Yogi initiated the
          current interest in meditation when he brought TM to the West. Susan
          Shumsky's book is the most comprehensive account of the history of his
          Movement and reveals what it is like to be close to a great spiritual
          teacher." <br /><br />—Peter Russell, bestselling author,
          <i>The Global Brain</i> and <i>From Science to God</i
          ><br /><br />"Susan Shumsky had a front-row seat at a spiritual
          revolution that profoundly affected all of us. She tells the tale with
          personal candor, a keen eye for pertinent detail, and a perspective
          seasoned by time and experience." <br /><br />—Philip Goldberg,
          author,
          <i
            >American Veda: From Emerson and the Beatles to Yoga and Meditation,
            How Indian Spirituality Changed the West</i
          ><br /><br />"Full of fascinating information about TM, its founder
          Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and the celebrities who followed him, Susan
          Shumsky's book <i>Maharishi &amp; Me</i> is a captivating read."
          <br /><br />—John Gray, bestselling author,
