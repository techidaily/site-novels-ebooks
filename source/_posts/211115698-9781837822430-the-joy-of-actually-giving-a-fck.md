          ><br /><b>Dr. Julie Smith, <i>Sunday Times </i>bestselling author</b
          ><br /><br />Far from being fluffy sentiments, acts of kindness –
          whether given, received or witnessed – are potent elixirs that have a
          profound and lasting impact on our mental and physical health.<br /><br />From
          boosting happiness to soothing the soul, kindness isn’t just a
          feel-good notion – it’s a powerhouse. It relaxes your nerves, lowers
          blood pressure, reduces inflammation and even slows down ageing at the
          genetic level.<br /><br />This book serves as a beacon of light,
          urging you to spread kindness like wildfire. Because in a world where
          apathy reigns, giving a f*ck is revolutionary. And when we do, we not
          only enrich ourselves but bring joy into our communities and the wider
          world.

          ‘The biggest influence on our well-being is each other. David reminds
          us that we get to choose the influence we will have for each and every
          person we connect with. This book should be the thought for the day
          every single day.’ --<b>Dr. Julie Smith</b>,
          <i>Sunday Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>Why Has Nobody Told Me This Before?<br /><br /></i>‘David’s clear,
          thorough explanation of recent research on kindness does well to show
          that far from a weakness, kindness is instead a powerful force from
          which we all benefit. This understanding is an inspiring platform from
          which we can make the effort to bring more kindness into our lives.’
          --<b>Sharon Salzberg</b>, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of
          <i>Real Happiness</i> and <i>Lovingkindness<br /><br /></i>‘Dr. David
          Hamilton is one of the leading expertsin the field of the mind-body
          connection.’ --<b>Dr. Joe Dispenza</b>, best-selling author of
          <i>Becoming Supernatural<br /><br /></i>‘Exploring the transformative
          power of kindness, this insightful book brilliantly illuminates how
          acts of kindness benefit our mental and physical health, while also
          advocating for the paramount importance of self-kindness. A must-read
          for anyone seeking to foster a more empathetic and healthier world.’
          --<b>Dr. Rangan Chatterjee</b>, best-selling author of
          <i>Happy Mind, Happy Life<br /><br /></i>‘David Hamilton is the King
          of Kindness – he sets out the case and the science for why caring for
          others will make us healthier, happier, and bring more joy into the
          world. Hurray!’ --<b>Suzy Walker</b>, <i>Metro</i><br /><br />‘David
          explains beautifully, in his calming and clear way, how everything I
          fully believe to be true actually is. He has a way of putting facts
          into fiction and science into soul food. I use his workings daily to
          bring backbone and clarification to my own inner musings and beliefs.
          This book is another must-read if self-growth is your bag.’ --<b
            >Donna Ashworth</b
          >, <i>Sunday Times </i>best-selling author of <i>I Wish I Knew</i
          ><br /><br />‘I love David’s work, particularly his ongoing campaign
          to centre kindness as a core societal value, and to elevate its
          practice to that of a daily tool which has the potential to radically
          transform the health of our communities. This book teaches that while
          the effort to drop our defensive postures and choose to be kind is not
          always easy or straightforward, it doesn’t need to be grand or
          awe-inspiring to have a great impact. David reminds us that the power
          of caring lies in its humility and simplicity, which each and every
          one of us can harness to enjoy the good days and get through the tough
          ones together.’ --<b>Evanna Lynch</b>, actress and author of
          <i>The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting</i><br /><br />‘Imagine if nine
          billion people performed one act of kindness a day. We would create a
          climate change from fear to love in no time at all. The world would be
          changed and so would you. <i>The Joy of Actually Giving a F*ck </i>is
          a masterful, how-to guide to help you ‘go kindly’ and make a real
          difference in the world.’ --<b>Robert Holden</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Shift Happens!</i> and
          <i>Higher Purpose</i><br /><br />‘Dr. David Hamilton is a shining
          light in the world of wellness. His scientific approach yet accessible
          language mean everyone can benefit from his words in their life. Buy
          this book for everyone you love.’ --<b>Dr. Gemma Newman</b>, author of
          <i>Get Well, Stay Well</i><br /><br />‘Kindness is essential for our
          collective well-being and David’ spractical advice mixed with
          hard-core science is the perfect blend to inspire more of it! The
          world needs this book.’ --<b>Jaime Thurston</b>, founder and CEO of 52
          Lives<br /><br />‘A brilliant reflection on how every one of us has
          the capacity to improve our lives, by taking the responsibility to
          work on ourselves with all the challenges life brings with it, to be
          strong and kind with ourselves and the ones around us. David’s ability
          to line out what we all know in our hearts to be true is second to
          none: That real trust and respect, supported by small genuine acts,
          make a huge difference in our personal and professional lives, with
          one caveat–you really have to mean it. A must-read for any leader who
          has the courage and strength to embark on a journey to create a
          competitive business with all the difficult choices that come with it,
          but is always committed to do it with genuine kindness and respect for
          their people.’ --<b>Claudio Gienal</b>, senior insurance executive and
