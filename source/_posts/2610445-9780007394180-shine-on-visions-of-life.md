            The final book from the world’s favourite medium, who died in 2002,
            contains 101 original poems about life and commentaries on each one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Betty Shine died in March 2002 of heart failure, a bitter irony for
            a woman who spoke from the heart and devoted much of her life to
            healing others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having spent the last decade of her life committing her thoughts and
            tales of her incredible experiences to paper, producing 11 popular
            and often best-selling books, Betty had begun experimenting with a
            new outlet for her unique philosophy of life – writing poetry.
            Though she had written heartfelt poetry for many years, it was only
            in her last year that it was finally being recognized as being
            really special, when she began getting interest from professional
            record producers about setting some to music and turning a number of
            these verses into lyrics. It seemed that the musical instincts Betty
            had honed as a professional opera singer were showing themselves
            quite unwittingly in the way she wrote poetry.
          </p>
          <p>
            This final book from Betty Shine collects together 101 of Betty's
            poems, and is introduced by her daughter, Janet, who worked closely
            with Betty and has inherited many of her amazing psychic gifts.
            Janet also provides a short introduction to each poem, which allows
            the reader a unique intimacy into the background to each one. The
            collection is at once thought-provoking and inspiring, and presents
            an honest summary of so many of the thoughts and sentiments that
            made Betty's books so popular and stimulating. Betty’s wisdom
            enshrined in these pieces will provide support and solace to her
            many devoted fans, as well as being the perfect introduction for
            those who have yet to be touched by the mind magic of Betty Shine.

          Betty Shine was known worldwide for her powers as a medium and healer.
          She was the author of 11 bestselling books, including Mind Magic which
          was a Sunday Times No.1 bestseller. A former opera singer, she was a
          therapist for over 40 years and a healer and medium for 25 years. Her
          untimely death has left many fans bereft, and this book is a fitting
          tribute.
