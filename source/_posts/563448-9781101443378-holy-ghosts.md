            >In this remarkable true story, the haunting of a Long Island
            household forces a respected writer and editor to reevaluate the
            mysteries of life and death as he struggles with the frightening
            truths of his childhood home and his town's past.
          </b>
          <br /><br />
          Growing up in Rockville Center, Long Island, Gary Jansen never
          believed in ghosts. His mother-a devoutly Catholic woman with a keen
          sense for the uncanny-claimed that their family house was haunted. But
          Jansen never found anything inexplicable in how their doorbell would
          sometimes ring of its own accord; or in the mysterious sounds of
          footsteps or breaking glass that occasionally would fill their home;
          or even in his mother's sometimes unsettlingly accurate visions of
          future events and tragedies. Though he once experienced a supernatural
          encounter in a Prague church as a young man, Jansen grew up into a
          rationalist, as well as a noted writer and editor. <br /><br />
          Decades later, in 2001, Jansen moved back into the very same house
          where he had once grown up to raise a family with his wife. One day in
          2007, he encountered a strange physical sensation in his toddler son's
          bedroom: <br /><br />
          <i
            >As I reached into his dresser drawer, I felt something very strange
            behind me. Startled, I quickly turned around, but there was nothing
            there. I shrugged it off, grabbed the socks and, as I was walking to
            the doorway, experienced an odd phenomenon-sort of like an
            electrical hand rubbing the length of my back. I stopped and stood
            transfixed. "What the hell is that?" I said to myself. The pressure
            then seemed to break apart and, for a brief moment, I felt like I
            had a million little bugs crawling all over my back. Within seconds,
            however, the sensation was gone.
          </i>
          <br /><br />
          This became the first step in uncovering a frightening, fullblown
          haunting in his home-a phenomenon that lasted an entire year and
          eventually included unveiling the identities of the spirits who
          occupied his house; discovering the chilling story of a century-old
          murder in his hometown; encountering mind-boggling coincidences
          between local history and events in his own family; and finally
          engaging in a climactic exorcism with the help of Mary Ann Winkowski,
          the real-life inspiration for TV's <i>The Ghost Whisperer</i>. The
          events of that year-in which Jansen's family was terrified of and
          terrorized by ghosts in their own home-forever changed how he viewed
          the mysteries of life and death. <br /><br />
          <i>Holy Ghosts</i> is not only a gripping true-life ghost story but a
          funny and touching memoir, as well as a meditation on the relationship
          between religion and the paranormal, which are often considered at
          odds with each other but which the author shows are intimately linked.

          "<i>Holy Ghosts</i> took me into a completely convincing but very
          different version of reality from the one we live in. It serves as a
          forceful and fascinating reminder that we do not see the world that
          is, but only the part we have chosen to see. There are dangers and
          wonders in the dark, and <i>Holy Ghosts</i> affirms that they are very
          real." <b>-Whitley Strieber, author of <i>Communion</i> </b
          ><br /><br />
          "I have always believed in ghosts, paranormal phenomena, and miracles.
          But I've never read a book that tells of chills and ghosts in the
          house from a Catholic perspective. I read the book in a sitting. There
          are more than a few spine- tingling scares here, offered in such a
          benign, even life-affirming way, that we end up enlightened,
          entertained, and charmed."<b>
            -Beverly Donofrio, author of <i>Looking for Mary</i> and
            <i>Riding in Cars with Boys</i> </b
          ><br /><br />
          "Gary Jansen will both creep you out and educate you on the nature of
          'earthbound spirits.' His tale of the spirits haunting his family
          home, and of helping them cross over to the next world, is a thrilling
          treat that I couldn't put down. Jansen tells the best kind of ghost
          story-the true kind!"
          <b>-Julia Scheeres, author of <i>Jesus Land</i> </b><br /><br />
          "Gary Jansen's <i>Holy Ghosts</i> is a haunting memoir of both the
          paranormal and the heartbreakingly down-to-earth. By turns scholarly,
          comic, and creepy, Jansen shows us the ghosts in his house as well as
          his heart. Spellbinding and wise, this trip to the supernatural
          eventually returns us home, providing a deeper understanding of our
          faith, our fears, and the people we love."

          ><br /><br />"If you think ghosts might exist, you will thoroughly
          enjoy this startling personal account of things that go bump in the
          night. If you don't think they exist, do not read this book after
          midnight. You have been warned."&nbsp;<b

          <i>“Holy Ghosts</i> is more than just a gripping true story about
          ghosts haunting his family’s home and how he got them to leave. I
          thoroughly enjoyed the fascinating history that Jansen, an editor at
          Doubleday Religion, incorporates into the story about the Catholic
          Church and its beliefs in spirits, angels, and demons...His writing
          style is engaging and informative; I couldn’t stop reading..”
