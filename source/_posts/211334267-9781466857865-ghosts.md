            >A comprehensive history of the evolution of the ghost in the west,
            examining the behavior of the subject in the stories we tell each
            other.</b
          ><br /><br /><b>A <i>New York Times Book Review </i>Editor’s Choice</b
          ><br /><br />No matter how rationally we order our lives, few of us
          are completely immune to the suggestion of the uncanny and the fear of
          the dark. What explains sightings of ghosts? Why do they fascinate us?
          What exactly do those who have been haunted see? What did they
          believe? And what proof is there?<br /><br />Taking us through the key
          hauntings that have obsessed the world, from the true events that
          inspired Henry James’s classic <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> right up
          to the present day, Roger Clarke unfolds a story of class conflict,
          charlatans, and true believers. The cast list includes royalty and
          prime ministers, Samuel Johnson, John Wesley, Harry Houdini, and Adolf
          Hitler. The chapters cover everything from religious beliefs to modern
          developments in neuroscience, the medicine of ghosts, and the
          technology of ghosthunting. There are haunted WWI submarines, houses
          so blighted by phantoms they are demolished, a seventeenth-century
          Ghost Hunter General, and the emergence of the Victorian flash mob,
          where hundreds would stand outside rumored sites all night waiting to
          catch sight of a dead face at a window.<br /><br />Written as
          grippingly as the best ghost fiction,
          <i>Ghosts: A Natural History </i>takes us on an unforgettable hunt
          through the most haunted places of the last five hundred years and our
          longing to believe.<br /><br /><b
            >Praise for <i>Ghosts: A Natural History</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Clarke tells this [the story that inspired Henry James’s
          <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>] and many other gloriously weird stories
          with real verve, and also a kind of narrative authority that tends to
          constrain the skeptical voice within&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [An] erudite
          and richly entertaining book.” —<i>New York Times Book Review</i
          ><br /><br />“A fascinating social history&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
          exceptionally well written and researched.” —<i>Starburst Magazine</i
          ><br /><br />“Ghost-hunting gets a gentlemanly makeover in this
          meticulous history of hauntings.<br /><br />Clarke indulges his
          lifelong interest in the paranormal in this well-documented look at
          ghost stories and the people who have told them throughout history.”
          —<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          ROGER CLARKE is best known as a film-writer for the
          <i>Independent </i>newspaper and more recently
          <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i>. Inspired by a childhood spent in two haunted
          houses, Roger Clarke has spent much of his life trying to see a ghost.
          He was the youngest person ever to join the Society for Psychical
          Research in the 1980s and was getting his ghost stories published by
          The Pan &amp; Fontana series of horror books at just 15, when Roald
          Dahl asked his agent to take him on as a client.
