          After hitting rock bottom through addiction, bowling legend Bob Perry
          learned that religion is for people who don't want to go to hell.
          Spirituality is for people who have already been there. Perry tells
          his heart-wrenching, inspiring story of bowling for the mob and drug
          and alcohol addiction in his new book, <i>Redemption Alley.</i
          ><br /><i><br /></i>Perry, considered by many to be one of the most
          naturally-talented bowlers in the history of the sport, had potential
          to become one of the best even at the young age of 12. Unfortunately,
          he grew up in 1970's Paterson, New Jersey, where everyone knew someone
          who was "connected"—with the mob, that is. Instead of training for
          championships, Perry began doing odd jobs for wiseguys and hustling
          hundreds of thousands of dollars in after-house "action bowling" for
          John Gotti, who later became the boss of the Gambino crime family.
          <br /><br />Perry's connections with organized crime eventually landed
          him in federal prison, but not before he became addicted to crack
          cocaine, alcohol, and painkillers and was homeless on the streets of
          New York. Ultimately, Perry washed up on the shores of St.
          Christopher's Inn, a shelter run by Franciscan monks. It was there
          that he had six fateful encounters with an angelic messenger who no
          one else could see-a monk whose message was so powerful that Bob Perry
          has now been sober for 22 years.<br /><br />In
          <i>Redemption Alley,</i> Perry not only shares his remarkable story of
          bowling success, his dangerous association with hoodlums and
          gangsters, and his recovery from addiction, but also his inspiring,
          decades-long spiritual quest, and his sober journey back into the
          bowling world.

        <p>
          “There is an underworld in bowling that is as dark, deep and
          mysterious as anything in sport. <i>Redemption Alley</i> isn't just a
          book about knocking down pins; it's a narrative of hope that will
          strike at your heart. I, put simply, love this book.” —<i
            >Lars Anderson, bestselling author of The Storm and the Tide and
            Carlisle vs. Army</i
          ><br /><br />“Bob Perry's walk down the alley of addiction is a
          mythic, epic tale of the light of extraordinary potential snuffed out
          by a brain hijacked by drugs and alcohol. He rises from the depths of
          desperation and a seemingly hopeless state to bask in the light of
          recovery and grace. This deeply inspiring story carries the message
          that there really is no hole too deep.” —<i
            >Harry Haroutunian, MD Physician Director Betty Ford Center</i
          ><br /><br />“One thing that I've always stressed to my players is the
          importance of never giving up, no matter what. Bob Perry's life is a
          testament to that. Summoning the strength within himself to persevere
          against impossible odds, Bob emerged a champion. If I had 22 kids with
          his heart and resolve, we'd never lose a game.” —<i
            >Mike London, Head Football Coach, University of Virginia</i
          ><br /><br />“This isn't a movie, because it's real. This isn't
          fiction, because it bleeds truth on every page. This is the journey of
          a one-time child bowling prodigy who sank to the bottom of life's
          darkest whirlpool and then, through sheer determination and guts, swam
          back toward the light. It is one hell of a book.” —<i
