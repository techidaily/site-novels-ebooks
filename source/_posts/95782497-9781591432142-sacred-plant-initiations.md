          A practical guide to connecting with plants through ceremony <br />
          <br />• Explains how to commune with plants and their spirits through
          the traditional shamanic method of “plant dieting” to receive their
          teachings and guidance <br />
          <br />• Details 8 ceremonial plant initiations centered on common,
          easily recognized plants and trees such as primrose, dandelion, oak,
          and dog rose <br />
          <br />• Provides instructions to develop your own sacred plant
          initiations and make ceremonial plant elixirs <br />
          <br />• Includes four audio journeys to facilitate plant initiations
          <br />
          <br />
          In this guide to sacred plant initiations, medical herbalist and
          shamanic practitioner Carole Guyett explains how to commune with
          plants and their spirits through the traditional shamanic method of
          “plant dieting.” A plant diet involves ingesting a particular plant
          over a period of time so you regularly receive the plant’s vibratory
          energy as well as its medicinal actions. Adding a ceremonial element
          to plant dieting offers a sacred initiation by the plant world,
          allowing you to connect deeply with all aspects of a plant, receive
          its sacred teachings, and forge a relationship for guidance and
          healing, benefitting both yourself and others. <br />
          <br />Each of the eight ceremonial plant initiations detailed in the
          book was personally developed by the author through extensive work
          with her ceremonial groups. They each center on an easily recognized
          plant or tree such as primrose, dandelion, oak, and dog rose. These
          common plants have powerful teachings and healing guidance to share
          with those who communicate with and honor them. The initiations, for
          both individuals and groups, work with the Wheel of the Year, honoring
          each plant’s sacred timing and connecting with one of the eight Celtic
          and Pre-Celtic Fire Festivals--the solstices, equinoxes, and the holy
          days of Beltane, Lughnasadh, Samhain, and Imbolc. <br />
          <br />Offering practical instructions so you can develop your own
          sacred plant initiations, the author also include access to 4 audio
          journeys to facilitate the initiations in the book. She also explains
          how to make plant elixirs for use in plant diets and for healing. She
          shows how connecting with plants allows us to deepen our relationship
          with Nature, access higher levels of consciousness and spiritual
          realms, and facilitate the full flowering of human potential.
