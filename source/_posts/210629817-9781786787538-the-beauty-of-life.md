            >The final writings by the world-famous spiritual teacher J
            Krishnamurti, in which he reflects to himself on the natural world
            around him and what this might tell us about human consciousness.
            Includes previously unpublished material.</b
          ><br /><br />Most of Krishnamurti's books are transcriptions from the
          many talks he gave. This book however contains short pieces from his
          notebooks, which are heartfelt and intimate. More than 55 short
          entries, between one and six pages long, start with descriptions
          unfolding amidst mountains, jungles and rolling meadows and then end
          with his own spontaneous musings. The writing feels totally
          spontaneous and in-the-moment, and is never clich√©d&nbsp;or too
          smooth. You are drawn&nbsp;to consider his words&nbsp;carefully,
          because your mind is quiet.<br /><br />For Krishnamurti, the challenge
          is to keep our minds free from preconceptions and ultimately free from
          any concepts at all. So, you don't "decide" to meditate and you never
          consciously meditate at all as a distinct action. You actively
          meditate from one second to the next but without effort. It's just how
          you are. Our minds can bring us down and seemingly conspire against
          us, but a quieter contemplation of how things truly are can also bring
          breakthroughs and peace. This is exactly what this book is for,
          through its vivid scenes and helpful contemplations.<br /><br />Krishnamurti
          is perfect for seekers who have exhausted all the "how tos" and are
          disillusioned by teachers who are coasting or who are writing books to
          generate an income when they have nothing to say. The spiritual market
          is maturing and there are many people who want more. This is for them.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Jiddu Krishnamurti lived from 1895 to 1986, and is regarded as one of
          the greatest philosophical and spiritual figures of the twentieth
          century. He claimed no allegiance to any caste, nationality or
          religion and was bound by no tradition. For nearly sixty years he
          traveled the world and spoke spontaneously to large audiences until
          the end of his life in 1986 at the age of ninety.
