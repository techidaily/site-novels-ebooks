            The Louisville, Kentucky, neighborhood known as Old Louisville is
            one of the country’s largest National Preservation Districts and the
            largest Victorian-era neighborhood in the country. Beneath the
            balconies and terraces of the district's Gothic, Queen Anne, and
            Beaux Arts mansions, current residents trade stories about the
            strange and unexplained phenomena they encounter in their historic
            homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When David Dominé moved into one of these houses, he dismissed local
            rumors of a resident poltergeist named Lucy. But soon, disembodied
            footsteps and mysterious odors changed his mind. Now Dominé is one
            of Louisville’s best-known investigators of paranormal phenomena.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;<i>Haunts of Old Louisville</i>, Dominé takes readers inside
            the opulent Ferguson Mansion—where a phantom tosses books off
            shelves—and introduces them to the spectral stable hand who lurks
            around Campion House. He also examines historic tales pulled out of
            the headlines and even explores the claim that a winged demon haunts
            the ornate towers of Walnut Street Baptist Church.

        </h4>
        <p>
          David Dominé lived in a storied Victorian home in Old Louisville,
          Kentucky, and his paranormal experiences there formed the basis for
          his first book GHOSTS OF OLD LOUISVILLE: True Stories of Hauntings in
          America's Largest Victorian Neighborhood, which was a runaway
          bestseller. His second book in the series, PHANTOMS OF OLD LOUISVILLE:
          Ghostly Tales from America's Most Haunted Neighborhood, also met with
          critical acclaim, and his current projects include GHOSTS OF THE
          BLUEGRASS: Haunted Hometowns in a Haunted State, a book of hauntings
          that will feature more authentically scary ghost stories and legends
          from across his adopted home, and GHOSTS OF WAVERLY HILLS, a
          collection of paranormal encounters from America's most haunted
          location. In HAUNTS OF OLD LOUISVILLE: Gilded Age Ghosts and Haunted
          Mansions in America's Spookiest Neighborhood, David continues his
          fascinating exploration of a historic neighborhood that is quickly
          gaining a reputation as the most haunted neighborhood in the country.
          When not tracking down new ghost stories with his dogs at his side,
          David enjoys cooking for his friends and writing fiction. He teaches
          foreign languages at Bellarmine University and Indiana University
          Southeast and he also writes regular food and wine articles for
          Kentucky Monthly, where he is a senior correspondent and writes a
          regular column entitled The Bluegrass Peasant. Many of the recipes
          mentioned in his ghostly tales can be found in his cookbook,
          ADVENTURES IN NEW KENTUCKY COOKING WITH THE BLUEGRASS PEASANT.
