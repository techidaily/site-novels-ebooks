            In his most sweeping historical work, occult scholar and widely
            known voice of esoteric ideas Mitch Horowitz presents a lively,
            intellectually serious historical exploration of modern occultism,
            from astrology and alchemy to the dawn of Theosophy and modern
            witchcraft—and the spiritual revolutions that followed.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>In this lively, full-circle history, Mitch explores:</p>
          <p></p>
          Preservation of “hidden wisdom” in late-ancient Hermeticism.Rebirth of
          esoterica during the Renaissance, including Kabbalah, ceremonial
          magick, alchemy, Gnosticism—and the backlash culminating in the Thirty
          Years’ War.Rise of the modern “secret society,” such as Rosicrucians,
          Freemasons, and Illuminati.Migration of religious radicalism to the
          New World, including how enslaved people devised the magickal system
          of hoodoo.Wave of occultism ignited by John Dee, the Romantics, Franz
          Anton Mesmer, Eliphas Lévi, and P.B. Randolph.The revolution brought
          by occult explorer Madame H.P. Blavatsky.Growth of New Thought and
          mind metaphysics.How fin de siècle scientists devised clinical
          protocols to study the supernatural.Occult influences in politics: a
          delicate topic weighed maturely.Heterodox movements and figures such
          as The Process Church, TOPY, Michael Aquino, and Anton
          LaVey.Pioneering voices including Manly P. Hall, Aleister Crowley,
          Rudolf Steiner, Edgar Cayce, Carl Jung, Gerald Gardner, Jack Parsons,
          Annie Besant, G.I. Gurdjieff, Alice Bailey, Austin Osman Spare, and
          Carlos Castaneda.Surprising occult influences on wide-ranging modern
          icons such as Frederick Douglass, Sigmund Freud, and Isaac Newton.How
          models of interdimensionality are loosening the hold of materialism on
          modern thought.

          “An amazing author…We are all so lucky to have you out there on the
          frontlines. You are a wonderful bridge connecting these ethereal,
          misunderstood, eyeroll-y subjects with a great methodology and with a
          great way of articulating them.”<strong

          “Wonderfully comprehensive...even to attempt this kind of history was
          a very challenging task—which Horowitz ably and amazingly pulls
          off...fluidly weaves in the origins, personal histories, and
          real-world impacts...a glorious historical mosaic that won’t soon be
          forgotten...The clarity of this exquisite picture, woven with an
          obsidian thread, invites each of us to transcend and
          transform.”<strong><strong>—Jordan Gruber</strong></strong

          “A masterful exploration of the intricate and often misunderstood
          world of occult history, striking a rare balance as a work of
          scholarly rigor and engaging storytelling...both enlightening and
          deeply fascinating…a seminal work that provides a comprehensive and
          nuanced understanding...a key resource.”<strong

          “Horowitz effortlessly navigates between believer and critic,
          presenting readers with a clear-eyed view of his subject matter,
          neither letting occultists off the hook nor treating them
          cynically…vitally important.”<strong

        <p>
          “Both a fascinating read and a veritable encyclopedia of occultism’s
          history over the past two millennia…Horowitz has, in effect,
          catalogued an up-to-date version of significant information
          which…could form the basis for a current and timely addition to Manly
          P. Hall’s magnum opus.”<strong

          “I loved this book. I had so much fun reading this. The number one
          thing I wanted to note is the overwhelming generosity that I felt in
          this book towards not just the subject matter but the wide variety of
          possible readers.”<strong

          “Mitch Horowitz has crowned his series of specialized books by writing
          about that indefinable ‘thing’ that underlies them all. He approaches
          it with openness and good humor, treating the founding parents (few of
          whom would call themselves occultists) with the affection they
          deserve. The later chapters benefit from his knowledge of popular
          culture and scientific speculation, and the whole book from his nose
          for arcane sources. Highly recommended as a gateway for the curious
          and a recreation for veteran readers.”<strong

          “Presents a sprawling history of the occult, looking at its revival in
          Renaissance-era Europe and the threads that connect it to antiquity
          and the present. While he examines many different strains within
          occultism, including those associated with fascism, Horowitz presents
          a frequently liberatory view—socially and personally—of the diverse
          movement.”<strong

          “Are you a seeker? If so, you have probably encountered the work of
          Mitch Horowitz, one of the leading American historians of alternative
          spirituality…Horowitz has taken occult ideas and traditions often
          dismissed as strange or unserious—including witchcraft, astrology,
          alchemy, extrasensory perception, telepathy and seances—and made them
          accessible to uninitiated readers…Modern Occultism covers everything
          from Kabbalah to the African American ‘sex magic’ pioneer Paschal
          Beverly Randolph to the Church of Satan.”—<strong

          “The New Age has always been gnostic, by which I mean the movement has
          often been both fiercely critical of society and deeply rooted in

          read Mitch Horowitz. You will see’.”—<strong
