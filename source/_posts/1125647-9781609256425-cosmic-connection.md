          <p>
            In a bold departure from her earlier books, medium and psychic
            Carole Lynne shares the story of her own growing revelation of the
            interconnected, interplanetary, cosmic energy that flows around and
            through us all, that is, indeed, the stuff we are made of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experience Carole Lynne's journey of a lifetime as she goes into an
            altered state of consciousness and brings messages from "My
            Guidance" and "The Energy." Receive a glimpse into the nature of the
            spiritual forces that have created us and continue to manifest life.
            Evolution is not over! The future of our world depends on our
            abilities to evolve in a positive way: to let go of our egos, to
            realize that we are not separate beings, and to evolve to a
            consciousness that finds poverty, pollution, and war unthinkable. We
            are responsible for the future. But how can we change in order to
            have better personal lives and to make better choices for our world?
          </p>
          <p>
            As we approach 2012 and a seeming meltdown of economic and societal
            infrastructures more and more people are turning to other realms for
            solace, advice, and the tools they need to live every day. In the
            past when this has happened (during the Great Depression or WWI, for
            example) a great deal of material from other realms was given to us.
            Carole Lynne’s work joins that of her predecessors and her
            contemporaries in providing that information for tomorrow’s world.

          "Carole Lynne’s <i>Cosmic Connections</i> is an extraordinary personal
          journey of discovery and spiritual exploration. In the beginning, we
          are taken into the depth of Carole’s doubts about the source of
          information she is receiving. She also takes us through doorways to
          evidence and proofs that deepen her spiritual enfoldment and
          connections. This book is for anyone who questions his or her
          intuitive insights, who asks, 'How do I know that? Where does this
          information come from?’ Carole brings us to a place of trust and
          confidence that much of our immeasurable information comes from our
          spiritual or cosmic connections. Her stories reassure us that each of
          us can tap into this stream of consciousness. It is, in fact, our gift
          and wisdom to listen. As a medical scientist who always questioned how
          did I know what I knew, information that I had received not from a
          book, Carole Lynne’s Cosmic Connections reminds me that I was, and am,
          tuned into my higher self and divine wisdom. Her book supports
          trusting this blessing from the universe." -Sondra Barrett, PhD:
