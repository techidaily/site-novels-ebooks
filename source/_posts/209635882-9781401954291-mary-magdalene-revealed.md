            >--WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER-- The Gospel of Mary Magdalene
            reveals a very different love story from the one we've come to refer
            to as Christianity. Harvard-trained theologian Meggan Watterson
            leads us verse by verse through Mary's gospel to illuminate the
            powerful teachings it contains.</b
          ><br /><br />A gospel, as ancient and authentic as any of the gospels
          that the Christian bible contains, was buried deep in the Egyptian
          desert after an edict was sent out in the 4th century to have all
          copies of it destroyed. Fortunately, some rebel monks were wise enough
          to refuse-and thanks to their disobedience and spiritual bravery, we
          have several manuscripts of the only gospel that was written in the
          name of a woman: The Gospel of Mary Magdalene.<br /><br />Mary's
          gospel reveals a radical love that sits at the heart of the Christian
          story. Her gospel says that we are not sinful; we are not to feel
          ashamed or unworthy for being human. In fact, our purpose is to be
          fully human, to be a "true human being"- that is, a person who has
          remembered that, yes, we are a messy, limited ego, and we are also a
          limitless soul. <br /><br />And all we need to do is to turn inward
          (again and again); to meditate, like Mary Magdalene, in the way her
          gospel directs us, so that we can see past the ego of our own little
          lives to what's more real, and lasting, and infinite, and already
          here, within. <br /><br />With searing clarity, Watterson explains how
          and why Mary Magdalene came to be portrayed as the penitent prostitute
          and relates a more historically and theologically accurate depiction
          of who Mary was within the early Christ movement. And she shares how
          this discovery of Mary's gospel has allowed her to practice, and to
          experience, a love that never ends, a love that transforms everything.

          "This book is a masterpiece. I haven't been this excited or awakened
          by a book for a decade. This is what it looks like when an artist
          follows her heart and her passion instead of the crowd."<br />-
          Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Love
          Warrior<br /><br />"The evidence within these pages, both scholarly
          and lived experience, will change you on a cellular level as you
          remember what has been forgotten for thousands of years, but has never
          been untrue: that the feminine is sacred and holy. This book is a
          revolution."<br />- Kate Northrup, best-selling author of Do Less and
          Money: A Love Story&nbsp;<br /><br />"Meggan Watterson is a modern-day
          prophetess who sets souls on fire with her lyrical prose and
          courageous truth-telling. Her unearthing of the hidden and silenced
          realities of the first apostle's life and legacy ignites revelations
          that will transform the hearts and minds of readers who are ready to
          claim their own power and spiritual authority."<br />- Jamia Wilson,
          author of Step Into Your Power and executive director of The Feminist
          Press<br /><br />"Mary Magdalene Revealed brings together the
          exquisite balance of personal experience and the uncovering of
          spiritual texts that quite simply rock and lovingly challenge the
          Christianity of the world today. Meggan Watterson is the spiritual
          teacher to spiritual teachers and this book is a road map to the heart
          of Christ's message."<br />- Kyle Gray, best-selling author of Angel
          Prayers and Raise Your Vibration<br /><br />"Meggan Watterson is a
          conduit carrying the electrical charge of spirit and weaving this
          channeled energy into her work. She is a soul doula, gently holding
          our hands as we cross the river to spiritual healing and emotional
          salvation through these pages. If you ever wondered if the feminine is
          dormant in our spiritual traditions, Mary Magdalene Revealedmakes it
          clear that our past, present, and future lies within her."<br />-
          Latham Thomas, founder of Mama Glow and author of Own Your Glow<br /><br />"Fierce,
          raw, compelling, disruptive, and deep-Meggan Watterson has penned a
          classic. Read it . . . savor it . . . read it again, then let it
          change you."<br />- Colette Baron-Reid,best-sellingauthor of
          Uncharted<br /><br />"She is brave, she is beautiful, she is divine.
          Driven by passion, by a calling higher than she can see or know. She
          can deliver us all into a new stratosphere of love and divinity. Am I
          describing Mary Magdalene? Or Meggan Watterson? Both. They are sisters
          in this holy mission of bringing Mary's breathtakingly beautiful
          gospel to the world, today."<br />- Regena Thomashauer, New York Times
          best-selling author of Pussy: A Reclamation<br /><br />"Like a
          feminist Indiana Jones, Meggan Watterson goes on a mystical adventure
          to uncover the hidden teachings of one of Christ's closest companions
          and disciples, Mary Magdalene, and her discovery could change
          history."<br />- Cheryl Richardson, New York Times best-selling author
          of The Art of Extreme Self Care<br /><br />"With deep honesty, soulful
          artistry, and intellectual rigor, Meggan brings us a picture of the
          real Mary Magdalene-the one who is alive in each of our hearts-and
          leads us through how to experience and live from the Christ in each of
          us in our daily lives."<br />- Robert Holden and Hollie Holden,
          authors and teachers of A Course in Miracles<br /><br />"After so much
          work, devotion, and innovation, Meggan Watterson deserves to be
          heard."<br />- Hal Taussig, Ph.D., author and editor of A New New
          Testament<br /><br />"Mary Magdalene Revealed is one of the most
          beautiful, powerful, exciting, and sorely needed books of our time.
          Fiercely honest and courageous, Watterson rejects the lies and
          limitations of patriarchal bias and resurrects the heartbeat of
          genuine love and intimacy with God and one another through the
          teachings and life of Mary Magdalene. I couldn't put it down!"<br />-
          Sonia Choquette, best-selling author of Waking Up in Paris<br /><br />"I
          have been waiting to read Mary Magdalene Revealed my entire life. Its
          pages will reveal the humble power of your soul and a truth that can
          be felt but cannot be put into words."<br />- Rebecca Campbell,
          best-selling author of Rise, Sister, Rise<br /><br />"It is rare to
          find a book that catalyzes a mystical awakening, a book that feels
          like a reunion with a long-lost key to your soul's evolution."<br />-
          Sarah Drew, best-selling author of Gaia Codex<br /><br />"Meggan has
          given us an extraordinary gift. Through her compelling and courageous
          work, we are called back to ourselves as bodies, as spiritual beings,
          to our wholeness and fullness, helping us to find our inner voice
          which will ultimately set us free."<br />- Celene Lillie,
          Ph.D.,director of translation for A New New Testament
