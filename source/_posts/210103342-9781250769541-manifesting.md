              way you imagined? Whether it’s too little money, a struggling
              relationship, or a dead-end job, it can seem as if nothing works

            ><br /><br />Too often we walk through life in a state of lack,
            choosing to focus our attention on our deficiencies and allowing our
            minds, bodies, and spirits to swirl with discontent and negativity.
            But when our focus and attention is sunk in darkness, that becomes
            all we experience in our lives. <i>Manifesting</i> offers a
            transformative new approach. By focusing on what you wish to have or
            achieve, instead of despairing over what you are missing, you will
            find that you can manifest those very things in your life.<br /><br />Author
            Kris Ferraro is a practitioner and teacher in the areas of healing,
            growth, and metaphysics who has used manifesting in her own life and
            practice for years. In <i>Manifesting</i>, she guides readers to
            envision and create the lives they’ve always dreamed of with real,
            actionable steps, exercises, and wisdom.

          >"I was hooked the moment I read the first sentence of Kris Ferraro’s
          book. Instead of glossing over the hard stuff and fluffing up her
          wins, Kris invites us into her story with a broken heart. Over the
          last 3 decades I've read many classics on manifesting and the Law of
          Attraction. I often noticed there was one thing that fell short for
          me. I’d read each basic formula that combined affirmation of the
          unlimited abundance of the Universe, cultivation of gratitude and a
          saccharine insistence on positivity. Yet it always felt like something
          was missing. These books withheld all the messy, miserable pitfalls
          which inevitably stop us in our tracks. Truth about the struggle is
          the thing that so many self help and spiritual development books lack.
          <br /><br />Not this book though.
          <b
            >Kris brings her raw, real authentic self to this wonderful guide. </b
          >She offers amazing tools, while she also shares her unvarnished
          truth. I’m so thankful for her willingness to teach about
          manifestation in a way that includes the hard, sticky snot covered
          reality of human life. It became a lot easier to keep going when I
          grasped that creating a life of our dreams doesn’t always happen
          effortlessly and easily. <br /><br />This book is
          <b
            >the perfect combination of straightforward, doable actions,
            inspiring pep-talk and emotional validation.</b
          >
          In the same way that Kris’s book <i>Energy Healing</i> has something
          for the newbie and the seasoned energy practitioner, this book has
          gems for anyone hoping to up their manifesting game. Even as a
          seasoned practitioner of metaphysics and energy healing, I found tips,
          tools, perspective and encouragement. I have no doubt this will be
          another treasured volume in my library for many years to come."

          recipe after recipe for shifting and creating a life you love. And

        </h4>
        <p>
          KRIS FERRARO is an author, International Energy Coach, teacher, and
          sought-after speaker. Leaving a lengthy career in social services to
          guide others in the energy and metaphysical practices she had used to
          heal herself, Kris empowers others through the profound promise that
          everyone can move from surviving to thriving. She frequently speaks to
          diverse groups on how purpose, love, faith, and balanced energy are
          the ancient antidotes to modern stress caused by our current climate
          of constant uncertainty. A lifelong learner in the areas of personal
          growth, healing, and religious/spiritual history and education, Kris
          applies this knowledge in her own life, teachings, writings, and her
          professional coaching practice. Having spent dozens of years studying
          Shamanism, mysticism, Jungian philosophy, New Thought, and Shadow
          work, along with a serious study in all things energy, Kris found the
          common threads woven throughout. She is the creator of Spiritual
          Freedom Techniques, a series of processes that combine spiritual
          practices and principles with energy balancing for super charged
          transformation. A former punk rocker, radio DJ, and performance
          artist, it was in healing her severe social anxiety that she was
          finally able to uncover her purpose and truly shine, without panic. In
          addition to writing and creating curriculum on transformation, and
          producing a cutting-edge newsletter with original photography, she
          writes and performs spoken word poetry and is an accomplished
          sculptor. When not traveling, she lives in Montclair, NJ, with her
          cats Ling and The Baby Cheetah. Her first book,
