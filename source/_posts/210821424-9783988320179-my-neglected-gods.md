            Tarot cards, speeding cars, several saints, and old dogs make
            appearances in Joanne Nelson's new collection of prose and poetry.
            She unravels the secular deities giving shape to her days, not only
            on planes, but in summer crowds, at conferences, and in long post
            office queues. Whether it's a bandaid in a pocket, the backup pen in
            a purse, or a hidden $20 in a wallet for just-in-case, Nelson
            explores what we carry for comfort. She delves into the Mercury
            retrograde conundrum and examines the significance of kitchens as
            holy places. Beer runs through it. There will be coffee.&nbsp;

            Join Nelson, author of the memoir, This Is How We Leave, in this
            humorous and heartfelt journey through life's often-ignored quiet
            moments. Ignored until, plate of cookies in hand, they come begging
            for a chat. All the while, the kids move out, the house gets put up
            for sale, and loved ones age.

          "With aplomb and arresting originality of language, Joanne Nelson
          bears witness to the complex relationship between troubled family
          legacies and self-determination. My Neglected Gods is a record of the
          compassion for self- and ultimately for family- that comes with clear
          seeing." Joanna Penn Cooper, author of The Itinerant Girl's Guide to
          Self-Hypnosis
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ancestors and heirs, neighbors and siblings-they punctuate Joanne
          Nelson's moving collection of essays, My Neglected Gods. I remember
          the characters in this book because each one is revealed through
          precise heart-wrenching detail: the "carefully tucked paisley sheets"
          of a mother's bed, "shadow selves" left in the "damp imprint" of
          towels, the neighbor who tells everyone about the metal plate in his
          head, the other neighbor who leans on Nelson's mailbox, catching his
          breath, not long before he dies, a baby who points at bunnies and
          goldfish crackers. There's sadness here, and grief and regret. But
          there's also appreciation and gratitude and attentiveness. More than
          anything, this collection of meditative essays is characterized by an
          assurance Nelson experienced during a mystical connection with her
          deceased grandmother: everything is going to be all right." Lynn
          Domina, author of Framed in Silence and Corporal Works

          "Joanne Nelson shows us in her collection My Neglected Gods the value
          of writing from "the inside out," that is, she harnesses the inner
          voice of perception first and then works toward the exterior
          environment to reveal a larger frame of reference, before directing
          those visions back into the author's interior.&nbsp;She tells us that
          she "though this was about leaving my home of thirty years for the
          last time" but by taking the reader into the confidence behind...and
          through...her eyes, we learn that almost everything serves as a
          revelation to where we are going, or even a "click of green light,"
          "I've never witnessed" but always remaining hopeful.&nbsp;This
          delightful collection of reminiscence and straightforward narrative
          never leaves the reader behind, no matter how deep into the sublime
          Nelson dives, and with each page that turns we find ourselves willing
          to go deeper and deeper into that amazing pool of reflection with
          her." Paul Corman-Roberts, author of Bone Moon Palace, 2021 CLMP
          Firecracker Nominee

        <p>
          "This book of prose and poetry is a lyrical dance through
          sepia-colored memories that make us at once melancholy for what we've
          left behind, and joyful at how far we've come." Martha Engber, author
          of Bliss Road
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is so much life in My Neglected Gods the book feels like one of
          those magic capsules that expand into a dinosaur when you drop them in
          a glass of water. The vignettes may be miniature in scale, and
          composed with elegant precision, but they contain entire worlds.
          Joanne Nelson is a writer of real heart and exquisite control."
          Benjamin Anastas, author of the memoir Too Good To Be True
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>﻿﻿</span>"The micro-memoirs that make up My Neglected Gods are
          little squalls that invite the reader to consider what constitutes a
          family and a life. Joanne Nelson jolts her reader with an electricity
          that comes from a masterly conjuring of the dead and the lost. Nelson
          is a magnificent writer." Alden Jones, author of The Wanting Was a
          Wilderness
