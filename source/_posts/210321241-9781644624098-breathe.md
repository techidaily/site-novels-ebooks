            Breathe. Take as many breathes as you need. Embrace yourself for a
            remarkable journey of four women: Anna, Beauty, Cherish, and
            Destiny. Hear their pain, feel their tears, and see them go insane
            and rise back to claim all that was taken from them. The only
            protection a woman has is God. Their story shows that the only
            guidance that can lead a woman that’s broken back to her pieces is
            sisterhood. Anna was trapped by a life of sexual abuse. Beauty was
            cursed by physical jealousy, neglect, and abuse. Cherish was lost in
            a man-made crazy asylum. Destiny was burdened by a blackened soul
            unsure, now, of her own destiny. Can you catch the rhythm of their
            poetic flow? Breathe is a release, an exhale for all those that have
            been living in inhale, unable to breathe. Can you hear your pain in
            theirs? Do you share their tears? Have you gone insane and tried to
            claim all that was taken from you? Then breathe! It’s okay because
            you have four sisters that will exhale with you. Discover how it can
            honestly feel like the entire world is against you. Learn how to
            relate to a loved one’s pain. See the world through the eyes of four
            women that survived the horrors of this life with nothing to hold on
            to but true faith in God. Could you have survived some of their
            breathtaking tales? What would you do if you had to walk a mile in
            victimized shoes? Open your eyes to the cries of little boys and
            girls. Understand the emotions that trauma derives. Just remember to
            breathe.
