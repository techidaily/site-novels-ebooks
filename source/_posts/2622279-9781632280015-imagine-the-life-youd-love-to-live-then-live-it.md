          Peg Conley has been an artist all her life but, like many of us, took
          a long detour into the working world where she was a "corporate sales
          queen" in Seattle with a lot of success and a happy, busy family. Art
          became the thing she did on vacations, weekends and when she could
          carve time out of her busy life. Something gnawed at her, a nagging
          feeling that life might hold something else for her in the midst of it
          all. Then came the big "aha" moment—Peg heard a still small voice
          inside: "Imagine the life you want to live, then live it. It's that
          simple!" Her family encouraged Peg to pursue her passion. Despite a
          great deal of fear, Peg Conley did the thing she thought she could not
          do and dropped her big job, big house and big life and moved to San
          Francisco to start a business based on her artisan stationery. From a
          handful of handpainted cards, calendars and posters, her company Words
          &amp; Watercolors was born and has been inspiring people, winning
          awards and raking in the sales ever since. Peg's intention with her
          work is to inspire and her art and writing all speak to life's great
          truths and those aha moments for which we all need reminders. What do
          you “imagine” your Ideal Life to be? It may take some time for it to
          unveil itself. You will need to have an idea of what it is you are
          looking to create. Spend some time in contemplation. For some that
          means a quiet meditation where images might come to you. For others,
          you might write about something you’ve always had a longing to create,
          or a dream that seemed far away and not attainable yet it doesn’t go
          away. The dream nudges at you, asking you to pay attention. Where
          words work for some people, pictures work for others. You may want to
          create a vision board. Gather your old magazines and begin ripping out
          the pictures that appeal to you, or draw your own images. Your Ideal
          Life will come alive via the images that resonate with you. Don’t
          hesitate to pick up a pen, pencil or crayons even and fill the blank
          pages with doodles of any kind. Do you still think of becoming a
          nurse? Don’t be disheartened, go online and research classes you can
          take at your local college to start the process. As someone once said,
          if you don’t start now, 5 years from now you still will be where you
          are but if you begin with baby steps, in 5 years you could be in a
          completely different place! So ask yourself the question: “What does
          the life I long to live look like?” Imagine it! Draw it, write it,
          collage it and just plain dream it. Believe you can have it and then
          go about creating it as you take daily steps towards becoming an
          enhanced version of yourself! All successful people are big dreamers.
          They imagine what their future could be, ideal in every respect, and
          then they work every day toward their distant vision, that goal or
          purpose.
