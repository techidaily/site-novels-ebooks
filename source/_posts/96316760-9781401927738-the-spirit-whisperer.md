            >There’s a special language that transcends time and space—a
            language that’s not constrained by the limitations of just words—but
            one that consists of signs, symbols, energy, and thought. A language
            that can only be heard when one truly listens. It’s the language of
            The Spirit Whisperer. <br /></b
          ><br />In John Holland’s past books, he explained how he came to terms
          with, and learned to accept and embrace, his spiritual gifts as a
          psychic medium; and how "readers" could develop their own intuitive
          psychic abilities. In this book, John picks up the fascinating story
          of his personal journey of growth and development as one of the most
          respected practicing mediums today. This work chronicles his career to
          date and includes some enlightening and heartfelt real-life case
          studies. <br /><br />He candidly discusses readings with clients,
          including those who’ve had their own After Death Communications (ADCs)
          —from the outrageous to the profound. John also explains the signs and
          symbols that our loved ones continually try to send us. One of his
          most popular sayings is: "Those on the Other Side want to talk to you
          —as much as you want to talk to them!" <br /><br />John divulges for
          the first time some of the extraordinary paranormal occurrences he’s
          witnessed throughout his career, and provides a rare glimpse behind
          the scenes of what it’s like to be a "Psychic Time Machine" for
          several television shows. He’ll also help parents who have a psychic
          child themselves. The Spirit Whisperer is a book you’ll want to read
          over and over, as many of the stories will touch your heart as well as
          your soul!
