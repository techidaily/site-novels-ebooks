          Writing together with Timothy Wyllie, the angel Georgia details the
          events of Earth’s ancient history during the fall of Atlantis
          <br /><br />• Reveals, in detail, the devolution of Atlantean life
          during its society’s decline, the calamities that enveloped the
          civilization, and the migration of this sophisticated culture to other
          areas of the planet <br /><br />• Shares Georgia’s travels to the
          planet Zandana, a world facing the same problems as Earth yet taking a
          very different approach to their resolution <br /><br />• Exposes the
          supreme significance of Earth and how our planet is one of the worlds
          on which the rebel angels are reincarnating <br /><br />An angel of
          Seraphic status, Georgia arrived on this world with the first of the
          celestial missions, over half a million years ago. During the angelic
          rebellion 203,000 years ago, which led to the quarantine of Earth and
          36 other planets from the Multiverse, she aligned herself with Lucifer
          and the rebel angels. After the rebellion, Georgia was permitted to
          remain on this planet as a Watcher, making occasional side-trips to
          Zandana, a sister planet also under the thrall of the angelic
          rebellion. Writing together with Timothy Wyllie, Georgia provides her
          personal account of Earth during the fall of Atlantis as well as
          accounts of her trips to Zandana. <br /><br />Georgia reveals, in
          detail, the devolution of Atlantean life during its society’s decline,
          the calamities that enveloped the civilization, and the migration of
          this sophisticated culture to other areas of the planet. She shows how
          the fate of Atlantis ties in with the Lucifer Rebellion and also
          offers us understanding of where human civilization is now in
          contemporary times. Her travels to the planet Zandana reveal a world
          at the same stage of development and facing the same problems as
          Earth, yet taking a very different approach to their resolution.
          Through her revelations, Georgia exposes the supreme significance of
          Earth in the larger Multiverse context and also how our planet is one
          of the worlds on which the rebel angels have been accorded the
          privilege of a mortal incarnation. She describes how this
          unprecedented interspecies mutation--rebel angel incarnations--started
          in Atlantis in the eighth millennium. <br /><br />Interwoven with
          Georgia’s narrative are her observations of Timothy Wyllie’s current
          and previous lives, including his involvement with the Process Church
          and his struggle to leave it. Georgia shares her words, in part, to
          awaken the 100 million rebel angels currently living their human
          lives, most unaware of their angelic heritage. She reveals how a
          mortal incarnation for a rebel angel is an opportunity to redeem their
          past and help prepare for the imminent transformation of global
          consciousness as the rebel-held planets, including Earth, are welcomed
          back into the Multiverse.
