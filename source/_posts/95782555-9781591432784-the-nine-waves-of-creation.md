          A guide to aligning your life with the frequencies of the Nine Waves
          of Creation<br /><br />• Explains the quantum physics behind the Waves
          of the Mayan Calendar system and how their holograms shape the human
          mind <br /><br />• Shows how throughout history each revolution in
          human consciousness has been driven by the activation of one of the
          Nine Waves of Creation<br /><br />• Reveals how we can consciously
          work to deactivate the negative patterns of the Sixth Wave and
          manifest the unity consciousness of the Ninth Wave<br /><br />In the
          past few years the world has witnessed changes in social consciousness
          whose sudden development the ruling scientific paradigm has not been
          able to explain. These changes correspond with the activation of new
          Waves of Creation emanating from the center of the universe that
          influence human thinking. From the Big Bang to the present, these
          Waves guide the evolution of the universe and, through their
          holographic resonance with the human mind, profoundly shape
          revolutions in religion, technology, economy, and social
          consciousness.<br /><br />Presenting a quantum-holographic perspective
          on world history and human consciousness, Carl Calleman explains the
          quantum physics behind the Waves of the Mayan Calendar system and how
          these Waves allow us to understand the shifting eras on Earth as well
          as the possibilities of the future. He describes how, prior to the
          activation of the 6th Wave in 3115 BCE, our social systems were based
          on a unified cosmic order, but the hologram of this Wave shifted
          society to an all-consuming focus on Good and Evil, leading to the
          rise of patriarchal religious structures, slavery, and warfare. He
          explores how later Waves and their new holograms helped humanity
          survive the negative effects of the 6th Wave, such as the Industrial
          Revolution of the 7th Wave and the Digital Revolution of the 8th Wave.
          In 2011, the 9th Wave was activated, bringing with it an accelerated
          push for a more egalitarian world, a rising awareness of unity
          consciousness, and access to the full power of all Nine Waves of
          Creation.<br /><br />Calleman explains how our individual resonance
          with each Wave plays a role in the quality of our lives and how we
          must consciously work to resonate with the higher Waves. Revealing how
          we can become quantum activists in a holographic world by aligning
          with the 9th Wave, the author shows how we each can help manifest the
          destiny of humanity hinted at in ancient texts.

          “<i>The Nine Waves of Creation</i> presents a speculative cosmology
          supported by the recent discovery that galaxies in the universe are
          not located randomly but ordered in a way that radically challenges
          previous cosmological assumptions. If Calleman’s ideas--which are
          refreshingly wild but rationally argued--are even partially correct,
          today’s assumptions about the nature of evolution and the evolution of
          nature will need to be reconsidered.”
