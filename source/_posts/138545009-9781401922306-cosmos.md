            >We stand at the threshold of a revolutionary and empowering new
            vision of the world. <br /></b
          ><br />The discoveries of leading-edge science and the insights of
          spirituality are converging to reveal that the CosMos and all that we
          term reality is wholly integrated, and that at its most fundamental
          level, it is a field of information. This is the elemental cosmic mind
          from which everything emanates, is manifested, and to which all
          ultimately returns. <br /><br />Research is also demonstrating what
          the mystics of all traditions have discerned: that we have the innate
          ability to envision, understand, and experience the CosMos at levels
          far beyond the limitations of our human persona. <br /><br /><i
            >CosMos </i
          >is co-authored by two explorers who combine almost a century of
          seeking to understand not only how the world is as it is, but why.
          Philosopher Ervin Laszlo, Ph.D., and healer and scientist Jude
          Currivan, Ph.D., offer a revisioned view of the world that is no
          longer fragmented, but is at last, whole. Theirs is a perception of a
          meaningful and co-creative world that is exquisitely tuned to be "as
          simple as it can be" for consciousness to explore itself.
          <br /><br />In these momentous times, the vision shared in Cosmos
          invites us to open our hearts and minds to re-member who we really are
          and to take our places as conscious co-creators of our realities and
          of our evolving cosmic destiny.
