          Recounts one woman's discovery of her ability to heal through contact
          with spirits and reveals how others can awaken this same gift in their
          own lives <br />
          <br />• Explains how reconnecting with our inner sense of joy is the
          first step in healing <br />
          <br />• Shows how to rid our life of the traumas from the past that
          hinder our spiritual development, including unresolved traumas from
          past lives <br />
          <br />• Provides a roadmap that others can use for rediscovering their
          own connections to the spirit world <br />
          <br />Like many others who have discovered that they have a healing
          vocation, Alexandra Leclere began meeting with other healers and
          shamans to learn how to put her gift to use. At one of these
          gatherings she was shocked to find that she was the only one who could
          see the spirit of a deceased woman that was being honored there--a
          sign that marked the beginning of a remarkable adventure that taught
          her how to use her gift for healing herself and others. <br />
          <br />Despite the extraordinary powers of clairsentience and
          clairvoyance revealed to her through her work with the spirit world,
          Alexandra Leclere shows that the greatest gift she has received since
          her shamanic awakening is the ability to experience unconditional joy.
          Often the pain caused by unresolved psychological traumas from the
          past--including past lives--is the key obstacle restricting access to
          the powers offered by the spirits. The first step in healing requires
          reconnecting with the joy that resides within us. Once this connection
          has been established, we are all capable of restoring our connection
          to the spirit world. Alexandra Leclere’s story provides a roadmap for
          finding our way back.

          “An exciting personal account of an apprenticeship with the spirits.
          Alexandra Leclere is wonderfully candid about how to avoid teachers
          who take our power away, to practice discernment in dealing with
          psychic energies, and to walk between the worlds in balance and with
          humor.”
