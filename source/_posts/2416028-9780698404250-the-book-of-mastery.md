            >The first book in channeler Paul Selig’s widely anticipated Mastery
            Trilogy leads you into an unprecedented journey of self-development,
            at once building your personal excellence and your ability to
            improve life for others.</b
          ><br /><br />
          The channeled literature of Paul Selig -- who receives clairaudient
          dictation from unseen intellects called the Guides -- has quickly
          become the most important and celebrated expression of channeling
          since <i>A Course In Miracles</i> rose to prominence in the 1970s.<br /><br />
          Selig’s three previous books --
          <i>I Am the Word, The Book of Love and Creation,</i> and
          <i>The Book of Knowing and Worth</i> -- have won a growing following
          around the world for their depth, intimacy, and psychological insight.
          Now, Selig embarks upon an extraordinary new trilogy on the “Teachings
          of Mastery” with his inaugural volume:<i> The Book of Mastery</i
          >.<br /><br />
          <i>The Book of Mastery</i> provides a deeply practical prescription
          for heightening your abilities, aptitudes, and sense of personal
          excellence. The Guides’ teachings go much further, however,
          instructing you how to improve life for others and, ultimately, for
          global humanity.<br /><br />
          As the Guides themselves put it: &nbsp;“We will tell you this: No one
          who reads these books will be left unchanged. They will be like
          molecular systems that reinvigorate and realign and reclaim the reader
          to themselves in their worth, in their identity and, beyond that, in
          their physical realm. Underline physical realm if you like. Because
          the physical realm that we teach in is about to go back to the stone
          ages unless you all get it together.”

          <span>About the Author</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          In his breakthrough works of channeled literature,<i>
            I Am the Word, The Book of Love and Creation</i
          >, and <i>The Book of Knowing and Worth</i>, author and medium
          <b>Paul Selig</b> recorded an extraordinary program for personal and
          planetary evolution.<br /><br />Selig was born in New York City and
          received his master’s degree from Yale. He had a spiritual experience
          in 1987 that left him clairvoyant. As a way to gain a context for what
          he was beginning to experience, he studied a form of energy healing,
          working at Marianne Williamson’s Manhattan Center for Living and in
          his own private practice. In the process, he began to “hear” for his
          clients, and much of Selig’s work now is as a clairaudient,
          clairvoyant, channel, and empath. Selig has led channeled energy
          groups for many years. In 2009 he was invited to channel at the Esalen
          Institute’s Superpowers symposium, where he was filmed for the
          upcoming documentary film Authors of the Impossible. He is the subject
          of the short documentary film Paul &amp; the Word and is featured on
          the A&amp;E/Biography channel series The UneXplained. His numerous
          radio appearances include Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. His
          recent and upcoming workshops include The Kripalu Center in
          Stockbridge, Massachusetts, The Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New
          York, and the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California.<br /><br />Also
          a noted playwright and educator, Paul serves on the faculty of NYU and
          directs the MFA in creative writing program at Goddard College. He
          lives in New York City, where he maintains a private practice as an
          intuitive.
