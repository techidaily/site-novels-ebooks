          <i>Accepting the Psychic Torch</i> is a brand-new collection that
          contains the full text of two of Sylvia’s best-selling books: the
          landmark <i>Adventures of a Psychic</i>, which details how a little
          girl from Kansas City, Missouri, discovered her gifts and was then led
          on a decades-long journey to ultimately become "one of America’s most
          successful clairvoyants"; and <i>If You Could See What I See</i>, a
          handbook on spirituality that is also full of anecdotes from Sylvia’s
          life, both before and after she became a world-famous medium who
          spends her time writing, lecturing, and appearing on TV.
          <br /><br />Yet this collection also contains a special treat: an
          all-new volume from Sylvia! Titled Passing the Psychic Torch, it
          focuses on the incredibly special relationship Sylvia had with her
          beloved psychic grandmother, Ada Coil. Drawing on her cherished
          memories, along with Grandma Ada’s numerous letters—many of which are
          reprinted in these pages—Sylvia gives us a rich portrait of a blessed
          soul who helped so many. She also delves into her own childhood and
          teenage years as never before as she relates how her dear grandmother
          not only became her mentor, but was indeed the mother she never really
          had. <br /><br />This is the book Sylvia’s fans have been begging her
          to write…and it doesn’t disappoint!
