            “Kenneth Sørensen masterfully shows how the human being is a
            seven-fold system of energies and offers a variety of meditations
            for accessing all the colors of this rainbow of potentiality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Integral meditation is an illuminating and wise presentation of the
            science of meditation. It is a candid spiritual autobiography – a
            magnificent synthesis of the author’s life to date and what he has
            discovered by consciously treading the path of the Soul.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Kenneth Sørensen (born 1962) is a psychotherapist, author and
            spiritual teacher, and the co-founder of Jivayou.com. He has an MA
            in Psychosynthesis from the University of East London and is the
            author of The Soul of Psychosynthesis: The Seven Core Concepts.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Integral Meditation, Sørensen offers a lively and comprehensive
            introduction to the esoteric philosophy of the&nbsp;<strong
              >Seven Rays (also known as the Seven Rivers of Life)</strong
            >, which teaches how we can achieve Self-realisation by integrating
            and embodying the seven essential energies that underpin the
            universe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sørensen explains how each of the Seven Rays can be navigated using
            a particular type of meditation that must be modified according to
            the meditator’s personal blueprint of spiritual energy. The result
            is&nbsp;<strong>a unique path to the Soul for every seeker.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            While reflecting with unflinching honesty upon his own spiritual
            journey, Sørensen shows how the application of tried and tested
            techniques of&nbsp;<strong
              >meditation can bring inspiration, transformation and spiritual
              breakthrough</strong
            >. The formula is as simple as it is challenging: the integration of
            a variety of meditation techniques can result in the manifestation
            of universal energies that will profoundly change our relationship
            to ourselves, to those around us and to the universe as a whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing heavily on the teachings of Psychosynthesis, Integral
            psychology and ancient wisdom, Integral Meditation presents an
            approach to the psycho-spiritual journey that can be summed up in
            the invitation: “<strong
              >Meditate, love and choose freedom every day.</strong
            >”

          “Meditation is an essential element of our daily life. It is the art
          and science of consciously building the rainbow bridge that spans and
          helps integrate the inner and outer dimensions and aspects of that
          living system we call the Self.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Kenneth Sørensen presents a comprehensive and easy-to-assimilate
          roadmap for spiritual development that is drawn from his own
          experience, the Ageless Wisdom teachings, and fresh perspectives from
          the field of integral and transpersonal psychology.

          “Kenneth Sørensen combines raw honesty and self-taught deep meditation

          and teaches, providing an uplifting introduction into a new, integral
          life perspective with a focus on meditation and spiritual practice.
          Old dogmas and spiritual prejudices are confronted and replaced with

          years of deep practice.”
