            >In this follow-up to Elisa Medhus’s novel
            <i>My Son and the Afterlife</i>, Elisa’s son Erik tells his
            astonishing story directly from the afterlife, describing in detail
            his death, transition, and spiritual renewal.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>My Life After Death</i> begins on the tragic day when
          Erik Medhus took his own life. What follows is a moment-by-moment
          account of the spiritual life he discovers on the other side—told in
          his own words as channeled by medium Jamie Butler and then transcribed
          by his mother, Dr. Elisa Medhus.<br />
          <br />Overflowing with his signature directness and honesty, Erik
          describes more than just a visit to the afterlife. He personally walks
          us through the experience of dying, the trauma and regret of
          committing suicide, transitioning into spirit form—revealing a
          detailed look at the life awaiting us on the other side.<br />
          <br />In this intimate, unique, and provocative memoir, crucial
          questions about the afterlife will finally be answered, including:
          What does it feel like to die? What is it like to become a spirit? Why
          and how do spirits communicate with the living? Is there a heaven?
          Ultimately, Erik’s story sheds light on his mental illness while also
          providing the answers that will help readers find solace and remove
          the fears surrounding death, showing that love has no boundaries and
          life truly does go on.<br />
          <br />*Content warning: Please note that there is some explicit
          language present in this book.
