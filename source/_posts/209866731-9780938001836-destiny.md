            In preparation, before beginning their training as immortal
            Guardians of the Earth, Lazarus of Bethany and his wife Hannah were
            asked to go on a short visit to a world in another dimension. “Just
            to look around a bit and get a feel for the differences,” Lazarus's
            mysterious sister, Miriam of Magdala assured them.&nbsp;<br /><br />She
            neglected to mention the ravenous monstrous birds, the ferocious
            fire-breathing dragons, the impossibly perfect people with sinister
            ulterior motives, and the fact that they would end up being naked
            almost all the time! And that was just the beginning of the
            challenges!

          Whoa! What a fascinating read! Great revelations! I wish it could be
          turned into a movie but sadly, Hollywood never creates spiritual type
          movies. Now I know dragons are real but not in this world. One thing I
          realized is that for a sentient being to become advanced in knowledge
          is not enough in fact it is a great recipe for disaster if moral
          advancement does not go hand in hand with it just like the Nartesians.
          Oh! By the way searching those names and terms used in the books such
          as "nagasa", "Nartesians" in Google yield no useful results. Therefore
          these things are really considered unknown to mankind.&nbsp; -- Edgar

          Finally!!! Have been waiting so long for this book. LOVE the cover
          illustration. If the cover was a poster I would put it on my wall. I
          read the entire book in one sitting, unable to put it down. The
          adventures of Lazarus and Hannah are unlike any adventure I've ever
          experienced in other books. It is not only a page-turner but
          introduces profound concepts. I urge you, this is a must read!&nbsp;

          This book really opened my mind to what the universe really holds.
          Helped me to see how small we are in this world of ours. Thank you

          It is an awesome book to read. Mind binding to the end.&nbsp; --

          Masterful Work. I eagerly anticipate the next book in this
          series.&nbsp; -- Shady Spirit

          This book has a very complex storyline and also prompts the mind to
          consider other worlds and experiences that will cause each individual
          to grow spiritually and mentally it also challenges the mind What
          miracles are possible in this world. -- Amazon Customer

          This is another book I found very fascinating and difficult to put
          down. It reads like a fantasy series with out of this World
          adventures. In the end faith prevails. -- ELECTA K.
