            The return to holistic therapies is one of the most important
            developments in health over the past two decades. With preventative
            medicine being taken more seriously by conventional health
            practitioners, and the increasing popularity of natural and
            complementary therapies among consumers, it is clear that a holistic
            approach will be integral to health care in the future.
            <br /><br /><i>Holism and Complementary Medicine</i> offers a
            systematic overview of traditional healing practices, the
            development of the Western biomedical model from the ancient
            Egyptians and Greeks to the present, and the holistic philosophy
            which is the basis of complementary and alternative medicine in the
            West. The book explores the differences between holistic and
            conventional biomedical traditions and approaches, acknowledging the
            strengths of each. It also addresses key practice issues, examining
            the role holistic principles have to play in today's health system
            and explaining their place in the therapeutic relationship.
            <br /><br /><i>Holism and Complementary Medicine</i> is an
            accessible guide for students, practitioners and anyone interested
            in the origins and core principles of natural therapies.<br /><br />'This
            scholarly exploration of the conceptual evolution of holistic
            medicine is a fascinating read. Di Stefano is to be congratulated
            for his articulate insights into healing relationships and how our
            health paradigms enhance or inhibit our understanding of health and
            disease.' -
            <i>Joseph Pizzorno, ND, President Emeritus, Bastyr University</i
            ><br /><br />'This is a magnificent read for students of natural and
            complementary medicine, as well as health professionals and lay
            public who have often wondered where the movement towards holism in
            medicine began and is headed.' -

            health of body, mind and society, drawing richly from a larger
            corpus of intellectual inquiry into history, philosophy, and human
            endeavor, including clinical medicine.' -
