          "I strongly recommend this book. Aaron shares his unique style of
          de-armoring that you will not find anywhere else. This book will show
          you the secrets for to how to open a body, the way Aaron would open
          mine. Even a practice session with Aaron would leave me in a state of
          no-mind afterwards: to just be, glow, and buzz with energy from my sex
          area into my every cell. I felt more feminine, soft, and sensual . . .
          the sexual me fully alive. It has been a pleasure to be a steady guide
          and encouragement in his growth as a professional in this field, where
          trusted, quality, male workers are scarce. I look forward for more in
          years to come." -Susanne Roursgaard, Founder of the Gaia Method

          "Aaron's work is outstanding. I have been working and teaching in the
          field of sacred sexuality and conscious relating for many years. I
          have received countless sessions and worked with many different
          people. My nose for quality is top notch, and this is what Aaron is:
          Top notch. If you EVER get the chance to work with him, GO FOR IT.
          He's highly skilled, respective, conscious, and his hands are
          absolutely beyond magic. This book will show you how to do the same."

          "I get many phone calls but there was something about the authenticity
          and honesty in Aaron's voice that interested my inner scientist,
          journalist, and therapist; moreover it whispered to the woman Signe.
          He had no ambitions, which gave me the unique experience to let go of
          control and judgement and allowed me to surrender. The experience was
          intense, very intense . . . a voyage into myself, to encounter any
          sensations that might arrive. He was like a Sherpa guide. With my own
          voice and breath, the pain transformed into pleasure. His touch gave
          me a compass that has set me off on a path to more tangible teaching
          and giving others this experience. I'm still passing it on, and this
          book can do the same for you." -Signe Bentzen, Author, Tantric
          Sexologist, and Couples Counsleor

          "Aaron is the kind of person you notice right away. He radiates
          passion, depth, joy, compassion, and love, and so does his work. What
          differentiates Aaron's techniques from all others that I've tried, is
          his ability to make you feel so comfortable, safe and loved; while
          releasing old traumas, shame and tensions. He makes healing
          pleasurable, simple, and fun! I have tried a lot in this field of
          work, but I can truly say that I have met no other as warm hearted,
          skilled, and professional as Aaron. His approach and techniques can
          forever change your body and your life. I love this book. Aaron takes
          so much knowledge and makes it come together in way that seems easy
          and understandable for even newcomers to grasp." -Gry Dagmar Schødt
