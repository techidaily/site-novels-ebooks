          <p>
            This book draws on the author’s four decades of study and writing
            about the relationship between astro-cycles, world affairs and human
            behaviour, while practising Buddhism to discipline his motivation.
            It completes a quartet of astrology books. The first two introduce
            astrology’s workings and its potential to clarify decisions in the
            modern world. A third, published in 2009, shows that astro-cycles
            reveal the intrinsic shortcomings of the world economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Reversing the Race to Global Destruction’ takes account of what has
            happened since 2009 against the astro-cycles immediately ahead. Can
            the present world economic and socio/political systems manage our
            affairs, without increasing economic uncertainty, conflict and
            ultimate collapse?
          </p>
          <p>
            Part one of the book uses astro-cycles to assess and describe the
            inadequacy of post-2008 attempts to sustain our present world
            economy. The apparent recovery for some is based on borrowed time
            that is fast running out. Why do an increasing number of people feel
            side-lined, many are desperate and hardly able to survive? Does
            existence have to be no more than a constant aspiration to grow and
            consume? Has it always been like this? Are the media, political,
            academic systems and the laws, rules and regulations that support
            this ever-expanding materialistic society shutting out better
            workable alternatives?
          </p>
          <p>
            Part Two of the book identifies a Golden Standard based on
            unshakeable principles of kindness, before all other considerations.
            It then looks again at how business, media, political, academic, and
            the practice of law would be enhanced and made more effective if
            guided uncompromisingly by such standards. This builds to a vision
            of a world that takes down barriers and people work together for the
            benefit of everyoneؙ; the very opposite to the way of the world of
            early 2017.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is a seed or contribution to the many movements of healing
            human relationships that must emerge, if the world is to survive and
            move on from dark messages of fanaticism, greed and selfishness that
            threaten our planet and our lives upon it.

          'What you do not wish for yourself do not do to others -
          Confucius''The freedom of all is essential to my freedom''Borders do
          not protect. Border areas are the unhappiest places on
          earth.'Astro-events enable us to step outside contemporary assumptions
          and see underlying trends''Abandoning the politics of greed is not
          only the way to personal happiness, but to a truly efficient world
          economy.''Happiness and security do not come from things, but from a
          world where our actions and economic, legal, scientific, educational,
          political and media systems are all motivated by principled kindness
          towards each other and the planet.''...hold to the Golden Standard
          principles explained in Chapter 8, with all our being,
          uncompromisingly, every moment. Accept that nothing is certain, except
          that real improvement comes only when everything we feel, think and do
          is founded upon that unshakable Golden Standard principle. Also, real
          change requires ongoing correction; including reconsideration and
          purification of the corrections already made. For real change comes
          when we are clear about principles and use them constantly to clarify
          and correct actions. This process takes time but, when approached like
          this, the reassuring joy of fully resolving issues increases
          exponentially.
