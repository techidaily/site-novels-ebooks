          <p>
            In the midst of a raging national controversy around the
            indiscriminate use of LSD, two authorities –
            <b>Richard Alpert, PhD (AKA Ram Dass) </b>and psychoanalyst
            <b>Sidney Cohen, MD</b> – spoke out on the dangers, merits, legal
            regulations and control of the revolutionary psychedelic drug. Their
            book was illustrated with a groundbreaking photo essay by journalist
            <b>Lawrence Schiller</b>, whose cover story for <i>Life </i>magazine
            introduced America to the sweeping new LSD epidemic and was a
            precursor to the federal criminalization of the drug.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the first national photojournalist to capture the American acid
            scene from the inside, Schiller began with a single contact in
            Berkeley, California, and built a large network of young, receptive
            subjects who allowed him to document their private experiences with
            LSD. At first, his contacts were few and difficult. “Many of them
            were afraid,” and said no. There were others, however, who were
            trying to exercise their rebellion, “and some…had a sort of
            missionary quality. They not only wanted to tell about their
            experiences; they seemed as though they had to.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Schiller’s reporting expanded to include <b>Timothy Leary</b>, then
            on trial in Laredo, Texas, and the <b>Merry Pranksters</b>, who
            stopped by his studio for stroboscopic photos after the Hollywood
            Acid Test. The deeper he went into the story, the more questions he
            had. Questions like, “Is the LSD state reality or illusion?” and
            “Can you understand…without having had “the experience?” Figuring
            others did as well, he asked Alpert and Cohen to answer them for
            readers—from their two opposing points of view. The unexpected
            result is perhaps one of the most deeply informative documents on
            psychedelics ever published. It sold close to a million copies.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a time when the use of consciousness-expanding substances is
            again making headlines, the moment that LSD burst out from the
            rarified world of Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert’s experiments at
            Harvard to acid parties on the Sunset Strip is worth a second
            look.&nbsp;
