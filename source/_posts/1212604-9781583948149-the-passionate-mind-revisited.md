            <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i> takes readers on a liberating
            inner journey into the workings of their mind that can transform the
            way people look at themselves and the world. This expanded inquiry
            reflects the authors’ own and the world’s evolution since
            <i>The</i> <i>Passionate Mind</i> came out in 1974. The original
            book focusing on the individual is now extended to social and
            philosophical spheres and global challenges, exploring how the
            world’s life-threatening dramas are largely a function of people’s
            genetic and cultural conditioning, worldviews, beliefs, and values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kramer and Alstad assert that humanity is on an evolutionary cusp
            requiring further awareness and conscious social evolution.
            Worldviews can create rigid beliefs and narrow identities that are
            destructive in a world of global impact. While acknowledging the
            fallibility of any mental construction, the book offers an
            evolutionary worldview deemed more likely than traditional
            worldviews or scientific materialism.
          </p>
          <p>
            In exploring what it is to be a human social animal,
            <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i> offers fresh vantage points on
            life’s core issues: the nature of thought, authority and belief,
            pleasure and pain, desire and fear, identity, love and care,
            freedom, power, gender, time, meditation, violence, and evolution.
            By demonstrating how to inwardly see and break through one’s
            conditioning, the authors delve deeply into the nature and processes
            of the mind, including how subjectivity filters perception. This
            approach to self-inquiry can help free people from mechanical
            responses that develop from unexamined beliefs and habits.
            Dysfunctional worldviews and their values inhibit the creative
            solutions much needed in a perilous world of runaway change. This
            book, through its discussion and methodology, fosters curiosity and
            truth-seeking. Kramer and Alstad offer new insights on personal and
            global issues that can facilitate a necessary shift to conscious
            social evolution.

          "In this timely, brilliant, and original <i>tour de force</i>, Kramer
          and Alstad, two of the seminal thinkers of our time, have given us a
          remarkable gift: a hopeful, unsentimental analysis of both how we got
          here and where hope for a viable future lies. If you read one book
          this year, let it be <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i>. It will
          broaden your individual and social awareness and change your life."
          <br />—Jeffrey B. Rubin, PhD, author of
          <i>Psychotherapy and Buddhism</i><br />
          <br />"Don't go to the movies. Put down your magazine. Shut off your
          computer. Read this book. It will show you what is<i>
            really happening</i
          >
          <i>now</i>. Being able to understand how the world is changing and
          what that means to you and your children is the real news of today.
          Accessible and profound. Read it and weep—or clap with joy. This truly
          is our future and, more importantly, our choice."<br />—Jeremy
          Tarcher, founder of Tarcher Books<br />
          <br />"<i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i> is a fearlessly rational
          engagement with subjects we all too often accept as beyond rational
          thought—emotion, spirituality, relationships, and life in a time of
          conflicting realities and an endangered planet. It's a fine and
          important book, and deserves to be widely read." <br />—Walter Truett
          Anderson, author of
          <i>All Connected Now: Life in the First Global Civilization</i><br />
          <br />"Whether <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is for you depends
          on your interest in philosophy, human behavior, epistemology, and
          personal development. This ambitious, broad-ranging book is by
          necessity abstract, but for philosophers, Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer
          are miraculously clear and lead the reader by meticulous steps to some
          surprising conclusions."<br />—Diane Johnson, author of
          <i>Le Divorce</i><br />
          <br />"Nobody does a more masterful job of folding back the fabric of
          our individual, cultural, and human attachments and revealing hidden
          denials, hypocrisies, and paradoxes than Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer.
          They are among the very few who can open hidden doors to rooms in your
          house you never knew were there—to both delight and disturb. This book
          will change the way you look at things—perhaps everything. Are you
          courageous enough to risk that? Reading this book is a glimpse into
          what the human mind is capable of perceiving and the mindset of the
          evolved human mind in the next millennia."<br />—Kevin W. Kelley,
          author of <i>The Home Planet</i><br />
          <br />
          "In 1974 <i>The Passionate Mind </i>took me on a journey into my
          deepest self; it made me dance in the dark. Now, in
          <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited, </i>the entire worlds—the cosmos in
          which that self resides—is explored. The investment many children of
          the ‘60s and ‘70s made in freeing ourselves is now turned toward a
          globe in need of freedom from hunger, poverty, and violence.
          <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is a critical tool for social,
          political, and ethical transformation."<br />—Frances Kissling, former
          president of Catholics for Choice<br />
          <br />"A welcome infusion of clarity, brilliance, and inspiration that
          will very likely blow your mind. This profound book is a
          philosophical, intellectual, and spiritual Rosetta Stone—not a glib
          compilation of simplistic answers but a critical frame of reference
          that challenges the way we think about the nature of thinking itself.
          <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is essential reading for anyone
          trying to get their bearings amid confusing and contradictory claims
          and ideas that have long been promoted about the meaning of
          self-awareness and social consciousness. If you intend to delve into
          any other discussion of the powerful social, religious, psychological,
          ecological, and ethical changes confronting current and future
          generations, <i>read this book first </i>or you may miss the crucial
          context that will help you make sense of it all."<br />—Keith Harary,
          PhD, executive director of the Institute for Advanced Psychology and
          author of <i>Who Do You Think You Are?</i><br />
          <br />"The phrase ‘looking inward’ has become anathema to many social
          reformers who put their emphasis upon external action. In turn, this
          ‘knee-jerk’ activism has been criticized by those who advocate inner
          development. Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer believe that both approaches
          can occur concurrently and provide a framework for this process in
          this brilliant book. If the twenty-first century is not be the last
          gasp of humanity’s time on Earth, the ideas and practices articulated
          by these two innovators will deserve credit."<br />—Stanley Krippner,
          PhD, professor of psychology, Saybrook Graduate School and coauthor of
          <i>Haunted by Combat: Understanding PTSD in War Veterans</i><br />
          <br />"A breakthrough in spiritual realism, pioneering in its
          confrontation of life’s perennial tough judgment calls, and courageous
          in its intolerance of the cryptoscientific pseudo-spiritual gloss,
          this book will meet you where you really live."<br />—Jeremy Sherman,
          PhD, MPP, executive director of the Berkeley Consortium on Emergent
          Dynamics<br />
          <br /><i>"The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>has afforded me deeper,
          clearer, more pragmatic approaches to my work and to the future of
          humanity and life on Earth. My worldview and experience of the
          spiritual dimensions of life are both more grounded <i>and </i>more
          expansive from the exposure to their thinking and exploration of their
          ideas. Much awaits you in exploring your own passionate mind! And the
          Earth needs our passion and clarity more than ever."<br />—Rio de la
          Vista, former editor of <i>Windstar, </i>conservationist<br />
          <br />
          "In times of transition and not knowing, visionary artists dance with
          the possibilities that they sense emerging for us. Diana Alstad and
          Joel Kramer have seen a magnificent potential for humanity and have
          written down their insights in an inspiring and practical way. I
          recommend their book as medicine for all who are curious about what
          might lie beyond the present confusion and challenges."<br />—Marion
          Weber, founder of the Arts and Healing Network<br />
          <br />"Nothing today is more critical than making sense of our times
          and what they ask of us. Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer bring important
          insight and integrity to this difficult task. Spiritual and scientific
          sacred cows get equally unsparing treatment.
          <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i> makes a valuable contribution at
          both a personal and a societal level."<br />—Charles M. Johnston, MD,
          author of <i>The Creative Imperative</i><br />
          <br />"Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer are exciting critical thinkers for
          our times, who, as passionate individuals, offer us provocative
          insights to investigate and navigate our own terrain in ransitional
          times. <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is a classic reinvented
          for this dynamic historic moment."<br />—Ganga White, author of
          <i>Yoga Beyond Belief</i><br />
          <br />"Kramer and Alstad argue with clarity and passion that the
          simplistic "be here now" mindset sweeping contemporary pop psychology
          tragically fails to account for how the past and the future are always
          part of how we construct any "now" and any "here." I found myself
          cheering at their insistence that negating the future in the name of
          spiritual enlightenment amounts to an amputation of our intrinsic
          capacity to take future consequences into account—a task of vital
          importance at this crucial stage in our evolutionary adventure."<br />—Keith
          Thompson, author of <i>Leaving the Left</i><br />
          <br />"It is clear that <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is a
          seminal book for our time. One of the core beliefs held by
          nation-states and most individuals is that "more is better." What a
          wonderful gift we have been given to challenge our unexplored
          assumptions to help us shift to a world that can fulfill us all."<br />—Wilford
          Welch, author of <i>The Tactics of Hope</i><br />
          <br /><i>"The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is a promising
          re-visioning of age-old philosophical dilemmas in a contemporary
          setting with important social and political implications. The authors
          are poignantly aware of the effects that Eastern thought and practice
          have had on spiritually inclined individuals in America over the past
          half-century, and they challenge head-on many assumptions flowing from
          their own and others’ earlier teachings. Their systematic
          demonstration leads to the stirring conclusion that a spiritually
          aware, caring life has to be lived future-oriented and in time-not in
          some timeless realm. By illuminating the roles of thought and
          diversity in a life of spiritual awareness, the authors’ book would
          re-orient and rejuvenate spiritual work, bringing it back into the
          world of time to become more effective and socially relevant."<br />—James
          Millikan, PhD, former professor of philosophy at Yale and University
          of Florida<br />
          <br />"In this book, Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer have combined more
          than thirty years of writing, experience, and thinking to construct
          for the reader a unique lens with which we might examine our
          worldviews, ideologies, beliefs, fears, and hang-ups. We see more
          clearly the consequences of our collective failure to free ourselves
          from the spiritual and intellectual compulsions that have led us to
          the brink of planetary doom. The coauthors urge all of us, if we are
          truly serious about planetary survival, to continue the struggle to
          engage collectively in the evolution of our consciousness. I commend
          them for this book, a superb achievement."<br />—Charles H. Jones,
          professor emeritus of law, Rutgers University School of Law<br />
          <br /><i>"The Passionate Mind Revisited </i>is an excellent resource
          for expanding personal and social awareness. Diana Alstad and Joel
          Kramer integrate many cross-cultural and interdisciplinary ideas to
          illustrate how we can continue to grow, create, and expand during
          times of uncertainty and open to possibilities not considered
          before."<br />—Angeles Arrien, PhD, author of award-winning
          <i>Signs of Life</i><br />
          <br />“[<i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i>] reads like a survival
          guide for the new world order—a manual on how to live consciously and
          well in a world that seems to be collapsing around us…The authors urge
          us to ask ourselves life's most important questions. But this book is
          not just a call to awareness; it is also a well-reasoned exploration
          of the human condition. Kramer and Alstad show us that the truth lies
          within us and that to know it, we must not only be open to it but also
          listening for it. At the heart of the authors' message is that the
          changes so desperately needed in today's world must necessarily begin
          within each of us.”<br />—<i>Yoga Journal</i><br /><br />"[<i
            >The Passionate Mind Revisited</i
          >
          is] a provocative challenge to existing worldviews and a celebration
          of ‘conscious social evolution.’"<br />—<i>iShift</i><br /><br />“This
          brilliant deconstruction of failed religions, social structures and
          rigid fantasies of ideal human relationships will give you a
          refreshing approach to a both/and perspective that will help you
          become a trailblazer, aware and freed from the adolescent stage of
          human evolution… The authors, Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer, show us
          ways to fluidly navigate the different dimensions of the human
          condition and come through it with our awareness, critical thinking
          and compassionate hearts intact and thriving.”<br />
          —MagickTarot.com<br /><br />“<i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i>
          takes readers on a liberating inner journey into the workings of their
          mind that can transform the way people look at themselves and the
          world… In exploring what it is to be a human social animal,
          <i>The Passionate Mind Revisited</i> offers fresh vantage points on
          life's core issues: the nature of thought, authority and belief,
          pleasure and pain, desire and fear, identity, love and care, freedom,
          power, gender, time, meditation, violence, and evolution. By
          demonstrating how to inwardly see and break through one's
          conditioning, the authors delve deeply into the nature and processes
          of the mind… This book, through its discussion and methodology,
          fosters curiosity and truth-seeking. Kramer and Alstad offer new
          insights on personal and global issues that can facilitate a necessary
          shift to conscious social evolution.<br />

          teacher at Esalen Institute (1968–1970). He is a pioneer and legend of
          modern American yoga whose evolutionary vision of yoga freed it from
          its authoritarian roots, re-visioning it for the West. <br /><br />
          Diana Alstad, a Woodrow Wilson Fellow, received a doctorate from Yale
          University in 1971. She taught in the humanities and initiated and
          taught the first Women’s Studies courses at Yale and Duke. She
