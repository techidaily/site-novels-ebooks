          • Shows how sound, even humming, can change the body’s tissues,
          rearrange posture, and release long-held emotional trauma and
          stress<br /><br />• Explains how to listen deeply to the body and
          discover the rhythms of the areas to be treated as well as how to
          intuit the sounds required for healing<br /><br />• Offers practices
          to help you immediately release tension and explains how to use your
          voice to release emotional conflicts so your body can naturally
          heal<br /><br />You are made of sound—listen deeply to the rhythms and
          stories of your audible body that ask to be noticed and integrated.
          With the power of the voice, you can heal your body layer by layer,
          awakening your cells while releasing long-held tensions, stress, and
          emotional trauma.<br /><br />In this guide, pioneer sound healer
          Vickie Dodd shares her system for addressing trauma locked in the
          physical body with the potent healing quality of sound. Touching on
          the functions of the nervous system and the parasympathetic breath,
          she explains how sound travels the inner pathways of the body,
          eliciting responses from the memory of tissues and muscles while
          bypassing the mind. Sound can change the body’s tissues, rearrange
          posture, and release undigested emotional experiences. With
          experiential exercises, you can explore how to listen precisely and
          discover the rhythms of the areas of the body to be treated as well as
          how to intuit the sounds required for healing—your unique soundprint.
          Singing love songs to your shadow, you will transform negative
          patterns into harmonious ones and discover the grace and peace that
          arise as your body’s tales and tissues come to rest. Sound truly
          allows you to dialogue effectively with your body for release,
          restoration, and renewed vitality.

          “I have been experimenting with sound healing on and off for years
          with singing bowls and more. . . . Even so, nothing prepared me for
          the experiences of healing I received as I began implementing Vickie
          Dodd’s sounding tool as outlined in this book. Her work and guidance
          has opened up a whole new connection to myself in the present. I
          hummed, I toned, I followed her teachings as I read. I learned, I
          grew, and I surrendered as the tones began to tone me, unraveling my
          stress and traumas and taking me to a deeper acceptance of myself. I
          believe that this book is a must-read for all who seek to embrace all
          of themselves, all of life and its infinite possibilities. The tool?
          Our own voice.”
