          An in-depth photographic study of the ascetic holy men of India<br /><br />•
          Includes more than 100 striking color photographs of Sadhus, their
          extreme austerities, and their holy festivals, including the Kumbha
          Mela<br /><br />• Examines the practices and beliefs of Sadhus from
          several different sects<br /><br />• Traces the historical and
          mythological roots of the Sadhus and shows how they have fundamentally
          shaped Hinduism since remote antiquity<br /><br />Spiritual
          adventurers, philosophical monks, naked ascetics, or religious
          transvestites, the Sadhus of India form a vital and unbroken link
          between the birth of yoga millennia ago and its present-day
          expression. Numbering in the millions, these mystic holy men are
          worshipped by the Hindus as representatives of the gods, yet they
          remain largely unknown in the West because they often live in far-off
          places, hidden from everyday life. <br /><br />In this full-color
          study of Sadhus more than 20 years in the making, photographer Dolf
          Hartsuiker illustrates the Sadhus’ world of ancient magical rituals,
          religious symbols, and ascetic practices. In his photographic quest
          across India, the author visited many holy places, attended religious
          festivals including the Kumbha Mela, and encountered and photographed
          thousands of Sadhus, befriending several as he was drawn into their
          inner circle. Sharing more than 100 striking color photographs from
          his travels, he reveals the Sadhus’ utmost devotion to their spiritual
          path through meditation practices, yoga exercises, penance, and
          austerities--sometimes taken to the extreme of prolonged self-imposed
          silence, bodily mortification, such as holding an arm above the head
          for years, or even ritual suicide--as well as their profound
          involvement with the mundane world as healers and teachers or
          magicians and sorcerers. It is a path of knowledge and devotion,
          renunciation and realization, sexual energy and spiritual power,
          divine intoxication and mystical union.<br /><br />The author examines
          the different beliefs and behaviors of each Sadhu sect, including the
          “sky-clad” Naga Babas, and traces their historical and mythological
          roots to show how they have fundamentally shaped Hinduism since
          antiquity. Revealing the powerful “otherworldliness” of the Sadhus,
          the author also exposes the mystical beauty that emanates from those
          who have chosen the path of asceticism in pursuit of knowledge of the
          Absolute and liberation from all earthly bonds.
