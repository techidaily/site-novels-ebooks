          What if you could practice, and access, happiness at any time? When
          were you last truly happy? How did 'happy' feel? Some people find that
          being happy is a natural state of being, but for others it's a
          constant struggle to find contentment with all of life's stresses and
          upheavals. Bestselling author and psychologist Noa Belling has
          designed a variety of 'happiness workouts' to help you do just that.
          Based on scientific studies of biochemistry and neuroscience, this
          book teaches you how to cultivate happiness by honing certain physical
          skills such as strength, flexibility, fluidity, grounding and
          warm-heartedness. Deeply rooted within your body, these skills foster
          resilience, confidence and creativity to help you meet life's
          challenges skillfully. A happiness workout is made up of everyday
          quick practices, complemented by physical exercise programs that are
          designed to be accessible no matter your age or level of fitness. Try
          it out and feel how it optimises your brain function and reliably
          turns things around!

        </h4>
        <p>
          "Dr Ravi Ratan is a leading aromatherapist based in India. He is
          descended from a long line of healers and teachers, who inspired him
          to become a healer, too. As well as holding two Masters degrees, Dr
          Ratan also has a Doctorate of Science (Medicina Alternativa) from the
          Open International University of Alternative Medicine. After working
          for more than thirty years in the perfume industry, Dr Ratan
          discovered the healing potential of natural essential oils.
          Aromatherapy became his passion, especially the healing and
          therapeutic potential of essential oils on a physical as well as
          psychological level. Motivated by his successful results in healing
          and healthcare, Dr Ratan has focused on complete body therapy. Dr Ravi
          Ratan has undertaken extensive clinical research work on the use of
          essential oils for health and healing, and has created an aromatherapy
          workout regimen for the physical body focusing on problem areas and
          identifying causes and aromatherapy solutions. He now trains
          beauticians, alternative therapists and health club professionals in
          his methods. In his aromatherapy practice, Dr Ratan combines ancient
          Ayurvedic wisdom with modern aromatherapy principles - Vedic
          Aromatherapy - and creates unique blends for health and healing.
          Prominent among these are his anointments for seven chakras (the
          body\'s energy centres) which have been found very effective in
          restoring the healthy balance of mind, body and spirit. They have been
          used effectively by Dr Ratan\'s wife, Minoo Ratan, a practising
          psycho-aromatherapist and healer, in the treatment of various
          psychosomatic disorders and other chronic conditions. Thus, the
          fundamentals of five elements and three gunas (properties) have been
          used to select various essential oils for chakra healing and
          balancing. Both Ravi and Minoo Ratan have done extensive healing work
          in Vedic aromatherapy, using essential oils for chakras energising and
          harmonising, and together they wrote Journey through the Chakras.
