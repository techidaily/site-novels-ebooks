          What does a Les Paul guitar have to do with the path to
          enlightenment?<br /><br />One might say the stars and planets align
          the day Maggie takes Troy to her favorite second-hand shop to
          introduce him to Abe, the shop owner. Browsing through Abe’s shop,
          Troy discovers a weathered and dusty guitar case and opens it to find
          a vintage Les Paul guitar. Troy is a college student and low on cash,
          so Abe gives him the opportunity to barter for the purchase.<br /><br />A
          Vietnam veteran who is well into his sixties, Abe has strength and
          energy that defy his years. He and Troy spend two long days working
          together to move furnishings from a home into Abe’s shop. Through
          conversations that flow from the Vietnam War to Kerouac and to Buddha,
          Troy learns that there is a way to turn the pain of loss and dark
          regrets into a path where kindness replaces grief and compassion
          replaces fear. Although Troy never served in war, he carries dark
          regrets of his own. Inspired by Abe’s ability to be happy even after
          the horrors and loss he experienced in Vietnam, Troy is eager to
          tackle whatever is involved to practice the things Abe teaches him.<br /><br />How
          the Root of Kindness Works is the second in the How Life Works series
          that is drawn from Master Shantideva’s teachings contained in A Guide
          to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life. Verses from Master Shantideva’s
          chapters on Conscientiousness and Guarding Alertness provide the
          backbone of wisdom to the message Abe delivers to Troy. This message
          is the invaluable guide when another unexpected discovery requires
          that an important decision be made.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Janet Kathleen Ettele is a musician and author who draws from her
          background as a student of Buddhist dharma to bring its teachings into
          contemporary practice through her writing and her music. Two CDs,
          Piano Mandalas and Piano Mandalas – Compassion, are collections of her
          meditatively improvised music. She graduated from Berklee College of
          Music in Boston and worked in the entertainment industry until
          becoming a mother. She lives in Connecticut, where she has raised two
          sons. How the Root of Kindness Works, the second book in the How Life
          Works series, is her second writing of fiction.
