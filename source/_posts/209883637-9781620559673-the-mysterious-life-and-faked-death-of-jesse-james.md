          A deep investigation into historical documents that prove the
          notorious outlaw Jesse James faked his own death <br /><br />•
          Presents the legend of Jesse James and counters it with the real
          story, based on family records <br /><br />• Provides photographic
          evidence, a journal of Jesse James’s, and historical records that
          prove James faked his death, verified by experts and civic authorities
          <br /><br />• Debunks the 1995 DNA test results of James’s supposed
          remains <br /><br />The story of the notorious outlaw Jesse James’s
          assassination at the hands of Robert Ford has been clouded with
          mystery ever since its inception. Now, James’s
          great-great-grandchildren Daniel and Teresa Duke present the results
          of more than 20 years of exhaustive research into state and federal
          records, photographs, newspaper reports, diaries, and a 1995 DNA test
          in search of the truth behind Jesse James’s demise.
          <br /><br />Explaining how the accepted version of the history of
          Jesse James is wrong, the authors confirm their family’s oral
          tradition that James faked his own death in 1882 and lived out his
          remaining days in Texas. They methodically unravel the legend
          surrounding his death, with evidence vetted by qualified experts and
          civic authorities. They share the journal of their
          great-great-grandfather, kept from 1871 to 1876 and verified to be
          written in James’s handwriting. They reveal forensically confirmed
          photographs of James before and after his supposed killing, including
          one of James attending his own funeral. Examining James’s life both
          before and after his faked death, they provide an account of where he
          lived and who he associated with, including his interactions with
          secret societies. They compare the contradictory newspaper reports of
          James’s death with accounts by his family and associates, which
          support that the man buried as James was actually his cousin, and
          reveal how James tricked authorities into believing he had been
          killed. <br /><br />Further supporting their claim, the authors debunk
          the DNA test results of the exhumation of James’s body in 1995. The
          Dukes detail the ways in which the test was fraudulent, an assertion
          supported by the deputy counselor for Clay County at the time of the
          testing. Backed by a wealth of evidence, the descendants of Jesse
          James conclusively prove what really happened to America’s Robin Hood.

          “Drawing on more than 20 years of research, Daniel and Teresa Duke
          expound upon the family lore, Jesse’s diaries, and legal documents to
          disprove the misconception that their great-great-grandfather died in
          1882 and instead reveal that he lived for another 40 years in Texas
          under a different name, remaining unapologetic about his outlaw days.
          They give us the details of Jesse’s ‘lost years’ and what about Jesse
          remains elusive to modern science.”
