          In December 2007, author Kimberly Klein’s daughter, thirteen-year old
          Talia, died when the small private plane she was on with her father
          and her best friend crashed into the side of a volcano in Panama.
          Before the accident Kim did not believe in afterlife or anything
          spiritual. But her entire belief system about death and the workings
          of the spiritual world was shattered when, after her death, Talia
          reached out to her mom, physically touching her as well as talking to
          those that she knew would get her messages to her mom.<br /><br />One
          of those people was “G.” We first met G in Book I of The Universe
          Speaks: A Heavenly Dialogue. Through his ability to communicate with
          Talia, she was able to share her messages from heaven—messages that
          opened non-believers to an entire new belief system and clarified
          understanding for those that already believed. We learned that there
          is, in fact, an afterlife—and there is NO death. That we are all
          capable of communicating with the spirits; it is our birthright. We
          learned to live authentically—according to our hearts, not according
          to what others in our lives or society in general want us to live like
          or be like. And we learned that heaven is real. <br /><br />In The
          Universe Speaks A Heavenly Dialogue, Book II, Talia takes us deeper
          into the workings of the spiritual and teaches us the how-to’s for
          living up to our birthright: our right and ability to be in
          relationship with our true selves, with the Universe, and with our
          God.<br /><br />Talia’s words don’t just make us wonder, they actually
          address our questions. Questions like: Where is God? How do we become
          One? What is Oneness? The Universe Speaks: A Heavenly Dialogue, Book
          II answers these and many other questions about life—on earth and in
          other dimensions.<br /><br />It is the answer to what so many of us
          have been searching for.
