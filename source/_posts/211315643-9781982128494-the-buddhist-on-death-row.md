            >explores the transformation of Jarvis Jay Masters who has become
            one of America’s most inspiring Buddhist practitioners while locked
            in a cell on death row. </b
          ><br /><br />Jarvis Jay Masters’s early life was a horror story whose
          outline we know too well. Born in Long Beach, California, his house
          was filled with crack, alcohol, physical abuse, and men who paid his
          mother for sex. He and his siblings were split up and sent to foster
          care when he was five, and he progressed quickly to juvenile
          detention, car theft, armed robbery, and ultimately San Quentin. While
          in prison, he was set up for the murder of a guard—a conviction which
          landed him on death row, where he’s been since 1990.<br /><br />At the
          time of his murder trial, he was held in solitary confinement, torn by
          rage and anxiety, felled by headaches, seizures, and panic attacks. A
          criminal investigator repeatedly offered to teach him breathing
          exercises which he repeatedly refused. Until desperation moved him to
          ask her how to do “that meditation shit.” With uncanny clarity, David
          Sheff describes Masters’s gradual but profound transformation from a
          man dedicated to hurting others to one who has prevented violence on
          the prison yard, counseled high school kids by mail, and helped
          prisoners—and even guards—find meaning in their lives.<br /><br />Along
          the way, Masters becomes drawn to the principles that Buddhism
          espouses—compassion, sacrifice, and living in the moment—and he gains
          the admiration of Buddhists worldwide, including many of the faith’s
          most renowned practitioners. And while he is still in San Quentin and
          still on death row, he is a renowned Buddhist thinker who shows us how
          to ease our everyday suffering, relish the light that surrounds us,
          and endure the tragedies that befall us all.
