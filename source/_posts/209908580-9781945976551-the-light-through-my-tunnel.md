          <p>
            Traumatic brain injury and physical disability will change life as
            you’ve known it. My accident was a tragedy that changed my family
            forever. Ultimately, I was able to overcome it with courage and
            faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book begins with my marriage two years before the car accident
            that changed my perfect life with no warning. I describe the car
            accident that resulted in my traumatic brain injury. My mobility,
            fluent speech, my driver’s license, my career, my new family: these
            are the losses I incurred after my unfortunate car accident.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;I recount all of the trials, challenges and triumphs of living
            without the balance required to maintain an active life. I describe,
            often with humor, the new challenges of living in a disabled body.
            Life with poor balance is different from anything I have ever
            encountered. Yet my fierce independence and determination propels me
            to keep reaching for more improvements to finally attain the
            ‘normal’ life I so desired. I still looked the same. Please God! Let
            me move as quickly and effortlessly as I used to!
          </p>
          <p>
            I write extensively about all the family, friends and sometimes
            perfect strangers that have helped me to navigate in my new disabled
            world. For someone with such a self-proclaimed ‘simple life’, I sure
            do have a lot of great (and funny) stories to tell!
          </p>
          <p>
            I end each chapter with a prayer concerning the events that
            transpired in that chapter. This is my life. So until I read back to
            what it was like in the beginning, it’s hard for even me to see how
            God has been directing my every step. My prayers are for
            thanksgiving and sometimes for help!
          </p>
          <p>
            I write about seeing God’s grace as He carried me through this
            newest chapter in my life. I spend two decades trying to get back to
            the active, athletic, and fit person I was before my brain injury.
            That was the ‘old Mary’. Now I have become the ‘new Mary’….still
            active and fit, but with a new perspective on what is really
            important in life.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m embarrassed that it took so long to figure this out. You can be
            healthy, attractive and intelligent with a great career, family and
            friends; but without God as the center of your universe, you cannot
            have a truly joyful life. It took a traumatic brain injury to
            finally realize it wasn’t all about me.

          “Overcoming the obstacles of a brain injury demands more stamina than
          most of us can muster. Follow Mary on the twenty-year journey that is
          still in process, including the writing of this book. Her story of
          perseverance, discovery, and determination will amaze and inspire
          you.”

          “Mary Varga is a walking, talking testimony to God’s healing power and
          the resilience of the human spirit! This book about her experience
          with brain injury is such an encouraging read. I highly recommend to
          all!”

          Brain injury is a life-changing event for the person with the injury,
          their family, and everyone who cares about them. Mary’s story,
          struggles and triumphs are well known to the Brain Injury Alliance of
          Kentucky. This book captures perfectly the depth of her struggle and
          the victory she has found through her faith in God’s grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book is refreshing because Mary does not ask God why she has a
          brain injury. Instead, she shows in her reflection the presence of God
          in her struggles and how he has worked to help her overcome them
          through his grace.
