          <p>
            When two year old Daniel lay motionless on the floor staring at the
            ceiling,his mother had no idea that he was exemplifying the first
            symptoms of whatwould be diagnosed as autism two years later.
          </p>
          <p>
            The emergency room visit on that June 2002 afternoon resulted in a
            forty-eighthour hospital stay where Daniel was afterwards discharged
            with a simple, roughhorseplay diagnosis. However, within the weeks
            that followed he lost his speech,hearing, and cognitive skills,
            eventually slipping into a world of his own.
          </p>
          <p>
            Daniel was born a very healthy, bouncing, bundle of joy. He was an
            even moreactive toddler. However, in one moment of time his laughter
            ceased, the pitterpatterof his little feet racing through the house
            ended, and his voice that was onceheard in family conversations was
            replaced by ear-piercing screams and whines ashe tried to
            communicate his needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Convinced that Daniel was misdiagnosed, his mother prayed and began
            to seekhelp. Without knowing the giant she was facing, she
            relentlessly looked for answersand found them. On May 19, 2004,
            Daniel was diagnosed with autism. But thatwas not the end of the
            story! Instead, it was just the beginning!
          </p>
          <p>
            Rainbow Over My House is the amazing story of Daniels journey from
            pain andagony, to triumphant victory over autism! As you read this
            wonderful story you willlaugh, cry tears of joy, and even cheer as
            it shares details of Daniels victory, suchas him winning a potato
            sack race at a picnic! Expect your faith to be ignited as youfind
            the hope and courage to once again believe in miracles!
