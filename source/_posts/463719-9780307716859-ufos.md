            ><i>NEW YORK TIMES </i>BESTSELLER • Impeccably researched, this
            riveting journalistic investigation separates fact from fiction, and
            documents&nbsp;the unexplained mysteries of—and government reactions
            to—actual UFOs.&nbsp;<br /><br />“A treasure trove of insightful and
            eye-opening information.”—Michio Kaku, PH.D., bestselling author of
            <i>Physics of the Future</i></b
          ><br /><br />Leslie Kean, a veteran investigative reporter who has
          spent the past ten years studying the still-unexplained UFO
          phenomenon, reviewed hundreds of government documents, aviation
          reports, radar data, and case studies with corroborating physical
          evidence. She interviewed dozens of high-level officials and aviation
          witnesses from around the world. Among them, five Air Force generals
          and a host of high-level sources—including Fife Symington III, former
          governor of Arizona, and Nick Pope, former head of the British Defence
          Ministry’s UFO Investigative Unit—have written their own breathtaking,
          firsthand accounts about UFO encounters and investigations exclusively
          for this book. <br /><br />With the support of former White House
          chief of staff John Podesta, Kean lifts the veil on decades of U.S.
          government misinformation about this mysterious phenomenon and
          presents irrefutable evidence that unknown flying objects—metallic,
          luminous, and seemingly able to maneuver in ways that defy the laws of
          physics—actually exist.&nbsp;<br /><br /><b
            >With a Foreword by John Podesta<br /><br /></b
          >“The most important book on the phenomenon in a generation.”<b
            >—<i>Journal of Scientific Exploration </i><br /></b
          ><br />“Written with penetrating depth and insight, the revelations in
          this book constitute a watershed event in lifting the taboo against
          rational discourse about this controversial subject.”<b

            Studies at Austin </b

          on UFOs you will ever find. She may not have the final smoking gun,

          "At last, a serious and thoughtful book about this controversial
          subject. Skeptics and true believers will find a treasure trove of
          insightful and eye opening information. This book is bound to set the
          gold standard for UFO
          research."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />—Michio
          Kaku, Ph.D.&nbsp;Author of <i>Physics of the Impossible</i> and host
          of Sci Fi Science on the <i>Science Channel <br /></i><br />“I was
          astonished by the care and precision of Leslie Kean’s research in this
          terrific book.&nbsp; Her analysis is carefully reasoned and to the
          point; her craftsmanship in organization and writing are
          superb.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Her expose' raises important questions: Why
          does the US government create public distrust by neglecting this
          important topic? Why do its agencies avoid investigating cases of
          interference with flight operations and instead issue absurd cover-up
          stories?&nbsp; This book is ultimately an appeal to all scholars for
          an "extraordinary investigation of an extraordinary phenomenon.”&nbsp;
          <br />—Rudy Schild, Ph.D., Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics<br />&nbsp;<br />“Like me, Leslie Kean is an agnostic on
          the issue of UFOs.&nbsp; Her book is a fine piece of journalism - not
          about beliefs, but about facts.&nbsp; Kean presents the most accurate,
          most credible reports on UFO's you will ever find.&nbsp; She has
          fought long and hard to discover the facts and let the chips fall
          where they may<b>.&nbsp; </b>She may not have the final smoking gun,
          but I smell the gunpowder.” <br />—Miles O'Brien, former CNN
          space/science correspondent <br />&nbsp;<br />“I find explanations
          offered by UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists to be implausible,
          but I also have little patience with "deniers" who ridicule credible
          reports. &nbsp;Leslie Kean has found a thoughtful path between extreme
          views, documenting the UFO mystery with intelligence and insight. She
          makes a strong case for U.S. participation in official, international
          UFO investigations and for public dissemination of the
          results.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating first-hand accounts make this a
          thought-provoking book, even for those of us who don’t know much about
          UFOs.”&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />—Neal Lane, Ph.D., Rice University;
          former Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology
          Policy <br />&nbsp;<br />“If you don't know much about UFOs, you must
          read this book. If you think that UFO reports are nonsense,&nbsp;this
          book will disabuse you of that notion. Leslie Kean's UFOs informs
          readers at every level of knowledge and belief.&nbsp; It could, and
          should, become the "tipping point" that leads to public acceptance
          of&nbsp;the reality of UFOs and all of its implications.” <br />—Don
          Donderi, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, McGill University (Ret.)
          <br />&nbsp;<br />“In an area of study where there aren’t many, this
          is a serious book.&nbsp; It is credible, clear, and compelling,
          without any farfetched jumps in logic and assumption.&nbsp; Its
          credibility begins on the first page with John Podesta and continues
          with case studies of extraordinary quality to the very end.&nbsp;
          Leslie Kean not only makes the case for, but calls for, a whole new
          concrete and realistic perspective on UFOs that has more honesty and
          integrity than any other that I have read.&nbsp; This is a book for
          anyone with an open mind.”&nbsp; <br />—John L. Petersen, Founder
          &amp; President of The Arlington Institute<br />&nbsp;<br />“In these
          pages we are confronted head-on by the UFO phenomenon as revealed
          firsthand by highly credible government officials and military
          aviation experts. Their credibility and integrity cannot be
          questioned, and their firsthand observations cannot be ignored.&nbsp;
          Leslie Kean provides a challenging&nbsp;analysis and she writes with
          penetrating depth and insight. The revelations in this book constitute
          a watershed event in lifting the taboo against rational discourse
          about this controversial subject.”<br />—Harold E. Puthoff, Ph.D.,
          Director of The Institute for Advanced Studies at Austin<br />&nbsp;<br />“When
          I started reading Leslie Kean’s UFOs<i>, </i>I found it very difficult
          to stop. This is an unprecedented assessment of what may be the
          greatest challenge ever presented to mankind<b>.</b> In an outstanding
          piece of investigative journalism<b>,</b>&nbsp;Kean provides a
          well-written and convincing appeal for change in dealing with a
          phenomenon that can no longer be ignored.” &nbsp;<br />—Jean-Claude
          Ribes, Ph.D., Paris Observatory (Ret.)<br />&nbsp;<br />“For anyone
          who questions why - after more than fifty&nbsp; years of denial,
          ridicule, and dismissal - many scientists, academics, political
          figures, and military personnel still insist that the subject of UFOs
          should be taken seriously, this book provides the answer.&nbsp; Leslie
          Kean offers compelling documentation that physical objects, with
          flight characteristics not yet achievable by known technology, are
          being routinely reported in our skies.&nbsp; They represent a mystery
          that needs to be solved.”&nbsp; <br />—Stuart Appelle, Ph.D., Dean of
          the School of Science and Mathematics, State University of New York,
          Brockport<br /><br />"Leslie Kean’s astonishing book is the finest
          piece of investigative journalism ever written on this subject.
          &nbsp;She has an incomparable ability to ‘give voice’ to a
          constituency of exceptionally qualified and unbiased first-hand
          observers. They are not from the fringe, not groupies, and not
          delusional. &nbsp;Rather, they are high-level military, intelligence,
          aerospace, and government officials who speak with authority while
          providing reports that document actual, physical craft. Kean’s book
          represents the first important step toward a new U.S. government
          openness about UFOs.&nbsp; It brings forward a reality otherwise
          buried for far too long inside official mystery, and elevates the
          discourse above that of small-minded public discussions."<br />—Christopher
          C. Green,&nbsp;MD, Ph.D., Harper University Hospital, Wayne State
