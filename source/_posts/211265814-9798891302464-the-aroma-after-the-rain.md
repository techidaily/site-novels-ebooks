          <p>
            The name of my book, The Aroma After the Rain, came to be because
            when I sit and spend time with the Lord, I can always smell the
            beautiful aroma of flowers around me--particularly, in the rain when
            the aroma is even stronger.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I was inspired to write this book by a very close friend that I had
            the privilege of knowing for many years. Through those years, she
            would always say that she would love to write a book one day to
            encourage women of all ages and help them along their path of life
            with God. My beloved friend passed away a few years ago from cancer
            at the age of seventy-seven years young, and I was able to help her
            during those difficult times until she went home to be with our
            precious Lord and savior.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Then God began impressing upon me to write a book for women of all
            ages to help them as I have been helped along my walk with the Lord.
            So now I have written this book, praying that it will help women in
            every area of their lives because as we all know, life gets hard at
            times. We can overcome troubles or insecurities before us because of
            God--with Him and through Him alone. My prayer is for every woman
            reading these messages that you will become more aware of how
            valuable and precious you are to God. You are his daughter, and he
            is always waiting for you to come to him and share what is on your
            mind. And so, take a few minutes out of the day to sit with him and
            refresh yourself in his presence.
