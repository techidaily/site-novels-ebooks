            IT Shouldn't Be in the Church offers the reader an alternative
            approach to understanding the true value of what a church should
            look and feel like.The church is a community of called-out believers
            that believe in the same principles of faith and understand why the
            church is important to everyday life.Many dynamics of the church are
            discussed in the chapters as it invites thought-provoking reflection
            if the church is ready for the next progression or if there is more
            work to be done.The author provides a case for the importance of
            believers gathering together in fellowship, but does fellowship
            create an atmosphere of unity and peace? Many factors play an
            invaluable role in the methodology of the church, one of which is
            the teaching. However, are we learning all that we should know about
            the church, her history, and her purpose?IT Shouldn't Be in the
            Church is not a book of what if or why it isn't something; this book
            primarily focuses on finding ways to value and appreciate everything
            that is personal and true about the church so other believers can
            see Christ every time the doors open.This book asks the following
            questions:What is the church? What shouldn't be in the church? Why
            are there churches? And what controls the church?The author takes a
            revelatory response to the intelligence of what the Church is while
            providing a practical way to finding the answers.A Great Teacher
            said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My
            voice and opens the door, I will come in, to him and dine with him,
            and he with Me." (Revelation 3:20)Thomas E. Walker is a graduate of
            Liberty University Theological Seminary with a Master of Art in
            Christian Ministries; and a Master of Divinity in Pastoral
            Counseling from Liberty University Rawlings School of Divinity, and
            founder of two Christian organizations.
