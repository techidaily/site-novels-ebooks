          <b>Bridging the mystical and the scientific for Maximum Medicine</b
          ><br /><br />• 2024 Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold and Silver
          Awards in separate categories<br /><br />• 2024 Nautilus Silver
          Award<br /><br />• Shows how applying shamanic and energy medicine
          techniques alongside allopathic medicine can shift your health and
          allow you to increase your life force<br /><br />• Reveals how to
          sense the energy body in order to understand imbalances and develop
          greater control over your health<br /><br />• Looks at new ways of
          viewing health challenges and visualizing the potential for healing
          using symbolic medicine wheels and the Andean symbol of the Chacana<br /><br />For
          more than 20 years, Dr. Sharon E. Martin has been blending allopathic
          medicine with ancient shamanic knowledge to help her patients not only
          heal but also increase their vitality. In this practical guide to her
          Maximum Medicine program, Dr. Martin shows how understanding the
          energetics behind health imbalances and applying shamanic and energy
          medicine techniques can shift not only our perspective but our health,
          change the course of illness, and allow us to increase our life force.
          <br /><br />Bridging the mystical and the scientific,
          <i>Maximize Your Healing Power</i> helps us visualize our potential
          for healing using symbolic medicine wheels based on the elements, the
          compass directions, the four perspectives, and the inner tasks of
          intuitive exploration, amplification, intention setting, and ritual.
          Viewing our organ systems through the Andean symbol of the Chacana can
          help us understand and overcome health challenges. Change and healing
          is enacted through the process of the Four As—become aware, allow,
          act, affirm—with a new mindfulness matrix amplifying and deepening the
          process toward a greater ability to self-reflect.
          <br /><br />Presenting a clear, stepwise approach to attaining mastery
          of your health through many case studies as well as simple practices
          and methods to gain control over illness, Dr. Martin shows how anyone
          can support their own healing and experience being more fully alive.

        </h4>
        <p>
          “One of the leading emerging voices in the energy healing field, Dr.
          Sharon Martin is both a shaman—one who enters the energy field to
          facilitate healing—and a board-certified internal medicine physician.
          Having experienced energy healing and other dimensions since an early
          age, she is uniquely equipped to present an integrated path that
          includes both approaches. Martin might order conventional Western
          medical tests for a patient and then might equally investigate a
          patient’s soul contracts and energy patterns. She calls this ‘Maximum
          Medicine.’ The shamanic perspective is that the soul contracts with
          which you came into this life aren’t static. The book includes many
          invitations to self-inquiry and shamanic exercises, one of which
          encourages you to change the rules of the game. A superb contribution
          to the new paradigm in healing,<i> Maximize Your Healing Power</i> is
          highly recommended for anyone seeking to understand every dimension of
          their health and maximize their vitality.”
