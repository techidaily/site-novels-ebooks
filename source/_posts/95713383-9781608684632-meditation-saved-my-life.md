          In 2003, Tibetan lama Phakyab Rinpoche was admitted to the emergency
          clinic of the Program for Survivors of Torture at Manhattan’s Bellevue
          Hospital. After a dramatic escape from imprisonment in China, at the
          hands of authorities bent on uprooting Tibet’s traditional religion
          and culture, his ordeal had left him with life-threatening injuries,
          including gangrene of the right ankle. American doctors gave Rinpoche
          a shocking choice: accept leg amputation or risk a slow, painful
          death. An inner voice, however, prompted him to try an unconventional
          cure: meditation. He began an intensive spiritual routine that
          included thousands of hours of meditation over three years in a small
          Brooklyn studio. Against all scientific logic, his injuries gradually
          healed. In this vivid, passionate account, Sofia Stril-Rever relates
          the extraordinary experiences of Phakyab Rinpoche, who reveals the
          secret of the great healing powers that lie dormant within each of us.

          “Phakyab Rinpoche’s amazing odyssey, beautifully depicted in this
          extraordinary book, inspires so much spiritual courage, strength, and
          wisdom. Our deepest aspirations and unimaginable possibilities are
          illuminated by the radiance of this precious jewel.”<br /><b
            >— Krishna Das, kirtan wallah and devotee of Neem Karoli Baba</b
          ><br /><br />“Phakyab Rinpoche shares with us the compelling narrative
          of how he healed the injuries he sustained in Chinese-occupied Tibet.
          Importantly, his story powerfully demonstrates what we now know from
          science: compassion awakens within us our own power to heal both the
          mind and the body.”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“Meditation Saved My Life tells us that we can overcome
          hatred with compassion and let go into healing. Phakyab Rinpoche opens
          heart and mind with the core spiritual teachings of Tibetan Buddhism
          in clear, inspiring language. He reminds me that bodhisattvas are here
          with us and that we can aspire to emulate them to reach our own
          realization.”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“Phakyab Rinpoche’s Meditation Saved My Life is a
          beautifully written, heart-gripping, and inspiring narrative of the
          courageous struggle of a wise and compassionate Tibetan lama who
          became a great teacher and healer, risking it all and winning over
          disfigurement and even death. Read this book and rekindle your faith
          in the human determination to choose compassion and courage, mind over
          matter; and ignite your own life.”<br /><b

          infectious, joyful radiance fills every space he enters and whose
          loving, childlike delight lifts every heart he encounters. His very

          humility and grace by a master of consciousness.”<br /><b
