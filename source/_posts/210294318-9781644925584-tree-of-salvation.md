            It has been an amazing journey, trying my hardest, to walk in the
            path towards the light, where Jesus Christ would want me. I am so
            grateful for second chances. I am thankful for third chances. And in
            my case, I am thankful for fourth, fifth, and sixth chances. That is
            the beauty of the atonement. This is the beauty of Jesus Christ. As
            long as we believe in Him and accept him as oursavior, we have an
            infinite number of opportunity to change for the better.I am so
            thankful to have these chances and to get the opportunity to grow in
            the process. I have learned through trial and error what is
            important in life, what makes me happy, and what it requires of me
            to be the best version of myself. I have also learned that having a
            father in heaven be there by my side to guide me, is real power that
            has truly worked miracles in my life. Also, I've noticed that His
            power can only work properly in me whenever I am doing what is
            expected of me to keep God by my side. This is where I find the
            atonement important to help fix my mistakes when I mess up and bring
            light back into my life.This book is just a portion of my life,
            through events that I have gone through, and how they have formed me
            into who I am today. Most of these trials that I have gone through
            have mostly came through my decisions to use drugs and alcohol, in a
            way that became a problem, revolving most of my time and energy
            focused around these substances. I have learned that having this
            lifestyle and way of thinking has given me many fallbacks in life.
            It has led me to be in even many dangerous situations and incidences
            that have happened to me because places and people that I chose to
            be around. It is a miracle that I am even still alive to share this
            story.I write this story of my life in hope that others may not have
            to go through what I have gone through. I also write this to also
            show even if you are dealing with any form of addiction that may be
            harming your life, there is still hope and a time to change if you
            really have the desire to change for the better. There is a father
            in heaven who loves you a great deal, who knows you by name, and
            gives us these trials so that we can be used in this life and the
            life to come for a direct purpose.I find it amazing that the creator
            of the universe created us to be His children. I find it amazing
            that we are created in His image. This makes me feel like we are an
            important part of the universe, being on the planet where the
            Creator has His children! I know that we live in a competitive
            world; a place where appearance, social media, and money means
            everything. It can sometimes be difficult to have an optimistic
            outlook on life. Also, we live in a world where religion is slowly
            decreasing, and people are losing hope. I believe that religion
            means everything and even helps explain why we are even here. My
            biggest issue with religion is that each religion tries to convert
            rather than accept. There is too much dilemma on who is right and
            who has the exact answers of complete truth. When in reality, each
            religion believes in a creator and a purpose of us all being here
            (Christian or not). This is just my personal opinion, but there
            seems to be too much arguing on truth that it pulls away from what
            religion teaches. And in my opinion, it should only express LOVE!I
            love having a testimony of life and the opportunity to strengthen my
            testimony in religion. Our Father in heaven means everything to me.
            You mean everything to me as well""being my spiritual family for
            being another human being. I know that we live in a difficult world
            but have hope in everyone here that we will each find our direct
            purpose. I believe my direct purpose was to experience a life of
            drugs and alcohol so that I could recover and share my experiences
            of the dangers of messing with these substances in a world that
            strongly revolves around this style of living, even considering them
            cool and fun. I'm still working on what else is expected on me but
            know by having faith and keeping our Father in heaven in my heart,
            he will guide me in what next to do. What's your purpose? I know
            that you have one; believe in yourself, believe in a Creator that
            knows you by name. Ask and you shall receive, knock and it shall be
            opened unto you. And that is a promise that comes from the HEAVENS!
            That is a promise that comes from GOD!
