          A profound understanding of the surrealists’ connections with
          alchemists and secret societies and the hermetic aspirations revealed
          in their works <br />
          <br />• Explains how surrealist paintings and poems employed
          mythology, gnostic principles, tarot, voodoo, alchemy, and other
          hermetic sciences to seek out unexplored regions of the mind and
          recover lost “psychic” and magical powers <br />
          <br />• Provides many examples of esoteric influence in surrealism,
          such as how Picasso’s <i>Demoiselles d’Avignon</i> was originally
          titled <i>The Bath of the Philosophers</i> <br />
          <br />Not merely an artistic or literary movement as many believe, the
          surrealists rejected the labels of artist and author bestowed upon
          them by outsiders, accepting instead the titles of magician,
          alchemist, or--in the case of Leonora Carrington and Remedios
          Varo--witch. Their paintings, poems, and other works were created to
          seek out unexplored regions of the mind and recover lost “psychic” and
          magical powers. They used creative expression as the vehicle to attain
          what André Breton called the “supreme point,” the point at which all
          opposites cease to be perceived as contradictions. This supreme point
          is found at the heart of all esoteric doctrines, including the Great
          Work of alchemy, and enables communication with higher states of
          being. <br />
          <br />Drawing on an extensive range of writings by the surrealists and
          those in their circle of influence, Patrick Lepetit shows how the
          surrealists employed mythology, gnostic principles, tarot, voodoo, and
          alchemy not simply as reference points but as significant elements of
          their ongoing investigations into the fundamental nature of
          consciousness. He provides many specific examples of esoteric
          influence among the surrealists, such as how Picasso’s famous
          <i>Demoiselles d’Avignon</i> was originally titled
          <i>The Bath of the Philosophers</i>, how painter Victor Brauner drew
          from his father’s spiritualist vocation as well as the Kabbalah and
          tarot, and how doctor and surrealist author Pierre Mabille was a
          Freemason focused on finding initiatory paths where “it is possible to
          feel a new system connecting man with the universe.” <br />
          <br />Lepetit casts new light on the connection between key figures of
          the movement and the circle of adepts gathered around Fulcanelli. He
          also explores the relationship between surrealists and Freemasonry,
          Martinists, and the Elect Cohen as well as the Grail mythos and the
          Arthurian brotherhood.

          “This book is a necessary resource for those readers interested, or
          rather compelled, by the implicit and explicit relationships between
          surrealism and the initiatory forms that comprise the great traditions
          of the esoteric and occult arts. The author, whose enthusiasm for his
          subject is equaled by his erudition, provides for the first time in
          English translation numerous excerpts from noted surrealists
          commenting directly on the subject at hand, whether it be divination,
          astrology, dark romanticism, the Celtic world, or alchemy, magic,
          Voudoun, Gnosticism and mythopoesis. His exegesis and conclusions are
          ripe, and should provoke the reader not only in terms of encountering
          the texts and works discussed throughout the various ages and contexts
          they were created in but also in recollecting, or revisiting, quite
          personal moments that have acted as levers or axial junctures from
          which much else evolved. Patrick Lepetit’s scholarship in this regard
          is revivifying and precise. A much needed looking glass into a still
          evolving gyre in which science, as a capacity for astute observation,
          and poetry, where our internal and external theaters merge, have ever
          the potential of reaching new syntheses.”
