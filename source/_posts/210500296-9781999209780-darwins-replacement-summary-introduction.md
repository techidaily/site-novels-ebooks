Our three decades of research has revealed a life-science that God has probably been using since He first created living entities including us. &nbsp;The science is called "atomic biology", but don't let the name scare you because the basics are simple enough for a fifth-grader to understand.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp; With input from 45 scholars, the essentiality for super-intelligent works is now 'proven' for creating, sustaining, maintaining, and repairing living entities, including us.&nbsp; </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp; Because there is such an enormous amount of super-intelligent work done for each one of us every second of every day, don't be surprised if God gets a little angry if we give "evolution' the credit for all this work that He is doing. </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal;"> Because "super-intelligence" (far beyond the capability of mankind) is shown clearly to be essential for building our cell-parts, and evolution has no intelligence to use, Darwinisms are now, in fact and in truth, falsified as the best explanation of the cause of life.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal;"> The potential benefits and values of this new life-science are numerous including improvements in food production, nutrition, medicine, physical and mental health, and more. </p><p></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">References:</p><p style="margin: 0px 2.85pt 0px 0px; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;">1&nbsp;&nbsp; Cohen, I.L., Darwin was Wrong-A Study in Probabilities, New Research Publications, New York, NY, 1984, p.5. </p><p>2&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.breitbart.com/national-curity/2016/01/12/professional-atheist-dawkins-says-christianity-bulwark-against-something-worse/&nbsp; </p></div> <div class="accordion-fader"></div>

Using science and mathematics,Atomic Biology proves beyond a shadow of doubt that life cannot be accidental.  Then the book shows that the only being capable of the creation of life and its orchestrated maintenance is the historical Omniscient, Omnipotent, and Omnipresent Triune God of the Bible and our Nation."</p><p style="text-indent: 6.5pt; line-height: 107%">-- Sharon E.Cargo, DVM</p><p style="margin-top: 0.05pt; text-indent: 7.4pt; line-height: 102%"><br></p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt; line-height: 110%">Your book demonstrates the amazing complexity of life, starting with even the simplest cell, and the numerous conditions needed to sustain life. That all this could be the result of blind, random evolution is highly implausible, andstatistically, virtually impossible. Hence, as your book concludes, this points to a super-intelligent Creator. Your book also notes that the USA, the UK, Canada, and Australia were all founded on submission to the Christian God, and urges those countries to return to acknowledging God, also in scienceclassrooms. I heartily agree with all this."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- John Byl, Ph.D.</p><p style="margin-top: 0.05pt; text-indent: 7.4pt; line-height: 102%"></p><p style="text-indent: 10.2pt; line-height: 110%">"My recommendation would be to rework the book as a series of 1-to-2-page studies for adult Sunday school classes and/or Christian High School classes.
