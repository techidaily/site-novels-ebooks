          <p>
            The Louisville, Kentucky, neighborhood known as Old Louisville is
            one of the country’s largest National Preservation Districts and the
            largest Victorian-era neighborhood in the country. Beneath the
            balconies and terraces of the district's Gothic, Queen Anne, and
            Beaux Arts mansions, current residents trade stories about the
            strange and unexplained phenomena they encounter in their historic
            homes.
          </p>
          <p>
            When David Dominé moved into one of these houses, he dismissed local
            rumors of a resident poltergeist named Lucy. But soon, disembodied
            footsteps and mysterious odors changed his mind. Now Dominé is one
            of Louisville’s best-known investigators of paranormal phenomena.
          </p>
          <p>
            In&nbsp;<i>Phantoms of Old Louisville</i>, Dominé recounts a
            horrifying encounter at the Spalding Mansion and the long history of
            the kindly spirit Avery, who guards the iconic Pink Palace. These
            tales of things that go bump in the night not only reveal why Old
            Louisville is considered the "most haunted neighborhood in America,"
            but also help to preserve this historically and architecturally
            significant community.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Best selling author David Dominé is a modern-day wordsmith who lives a
          storied 1895 chateauesque home in Old Louisville, one of the largest
          historic preservation districts in the country. A series of
          unexplained occurrences there led him to research the haunted history
          of the neighborhood, and since then he has delighted countless readers
          with tales of the supernatural in "GHOSTS OF OLD LOUISVILLE: True
          Stories of Hauntings in America's Largest Victorian Neighborhood" and
          "PHANTOMS OF OLD LOUISVILLE: Ghostly Tales from America's Most Haunted
          Neighborhood." An accredited interpreter and foreign language
          instructor, he also writes travel pieces and food reviews for various
          local and national publications. Travel is a great passion for him,
          and he has lived in the Philippines, Mexico, Spain, Italy, Austria and
          Germany - all places that allowed him to indulge his passion for food,
          wine and adventure. He holds post-graduate degrees from the University
          of Louisville, the University of California at Santa Barbara and
          Karl-Franzens-Universität in Graz, Austria. When not writing or
          teaching, he likes to sneak off with his dogs and hunt down new ghost
          stories in his adopted neighborhood. His most recent projects include
          a cookbook about new Kentucky cooking written by his alter ego, the
          Bluegrass Peasant, which was published October 1, 2007 by McClanahan
          Publishing House, Inc.
