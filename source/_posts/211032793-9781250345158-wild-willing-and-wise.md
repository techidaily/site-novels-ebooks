              contemporary reimagining of the Maiden, Mother, and Crone
              archetypes.<br /></b
            ><br />Whether we realize it or not, our lives are a constant cycle
            through three energies: the creativity and abundance of Wild, the
            courage and power of Willing, and the gratitude and surrender of
            Wise.<br /><br />
            HeatherAsh provides in-depth descriptions of the three archetypes,
            detailing how each presents in excess and deficiency, so that
            readers can begin to recognize emotional turmoil and hardship as an
            imbalance of their energies. Combining anecdotes, self-reflection
            quizzes, simple exercises, and visualizations,
            <i>Wild, Willing, and Wise</i> teaches readers how to bring the
            three energies into balance in order to find inner freedom and
            alignment.<br /><br />
            This interactive, radical guide is not a rule book, but an
            invitation into an ongoing journey. Join HeatherAsh Amara on her way
            to becoming fiercely engaged, wildly creative, unfailingly
            experimental, wonderfully confused, seriously delighted, and
            compassionately vulnerable.

          through the inner realms. This book is your dhow upon the river,
          guiding you through the labyrinth of existence, where you learn to
          navigate the unpredictable tides and currents of your own soul. It is
          a call to surrender to the flow, to dance with the river's song, and
          to find your own rhythm in this cosmic waltz. This book challenges us
          to reflect on our current relationship with the ever-flowing River of
          Life. Through its pages, we embark on a transformative adventure,
          learning valuable Lessons from the River that resonate deeply with our
          souls. 'Riding the River of Life' is a metaphorical voyage that
          reminds us to embrace the unpredictable currents, to paddle when
          necessary, and to rest when the river gently meanders. It encourages
          us to surrender to the flow of existence, finding harmony in both
          action and stillness." <b>—Marie Mbouni</b>, author
