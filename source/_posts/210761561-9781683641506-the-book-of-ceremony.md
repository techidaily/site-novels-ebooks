            <b>Sandra Ingerman</b><br />&nbsp;<br />We perform ceremonies to
            mark important events and celebrate holidays—yet our modern approach
            to ceremony only scratches the surface of its true potential. With
            <i>The Book of Ceremony, </i>shamanic teacher Sandra Ingerman
            presents a rich and practical resource for creating ceremonies
            filled with joy, purpose, and magic. “We are hungry to connect with
            more than what we experience with our ordinary senses in the
            material world,” writes Sandra. “By performing ceremonies, you will
            find yourself stepping into a beautiful and creative power you might
            never have imagined.”<br />&nbsp;<br />Weaving shamanic teachings
            together with stories, examples, and guiding insights,
            <i>The Book of Ceremony </i>explores:<br />&nbsp;<br />• The
            elements of a powerful ceremony—including setting strong intentions,
            choosing your space, preparing ceremonial items, and dealing
            gracefully with the unexpected<br />• Stepping into the sacred—key
            practices for leaving behind your everyday concerns and creating a
            space where magic can happen<br />• Guidance for working alone, in
            community, and across distances with virtual ceremonies<br />•
            Invoking spiritual allies—the power of working with the elements,
            the natural world, ancestor spirits, and the creative energy of the
            divine<br />• Sacred transitions—including ceremonies for weddings,
            births, rites of passage to adulthood, funerals, honorable closure,
            and new beginnings<br />• Ceremonies for energetic balance—healing
            and blessing, resolving sacred contracts, getting rid of limiting
            beliefs, creating Prayer Trees, and more<br />• Life as a
            ceremony—how to infuse your entire life with ceremonial practice,
            from planting a garden or to revitalizing your home or office to
            helping heal our planet<br />&nbsp;<br /><i>The Book of Ceremony </i
            >is more than a “how-to” guide—it will inspire you to create
            original ceremonies tailored to your own needs and the needs of your
            community. When you invoke the sacred power of ceremony, you tap
            into one of the oldest and most effective tools for transforming
            both yourself and the world. As Sandra writes, “If you perform one
            powerful and successful ceremony for yourself, the principle of
            oneness ensures that all of life heals and evolves.”<br />&nbsp;
