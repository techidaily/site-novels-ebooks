          In just over a decade, the Brazilian faith healer known as John of God
          has become an international superstar. Oprah Winfrey, Ram Dass, Wayne
          Dyer, and Shirley MacLaine have all visited him, as have the wealthy
          and the desperately ill. Renowned for performing surgeries using
          rudimentary tools such as kitchen knives and scissors, without
          anesthetics or asepsis, John of God allegedly channels "entities," or
          spirits, and goes into a trance-like state in order to heal his
          visitors. In recent years, a transnational spiritual community has
          developed around John of God, comprised of the ill, those who seek
          spiritual growth, healers, tour guides, and, according to followers,
          even spirits whose powers transcend national boundaries. Cristina
          Rocha offers the first ethnographic account of this global spiritual
          movement. Drawing on a decade of fieldwork in Brazil, the United
          States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and New Zealand, Rocha
          examines the social and cultural forces that have made it possible for
          a healer from Brazil to become a global "guru" in the 21st century.
          She explores what attracts foreigners to John of God's cosmology and
          healing practices, how they understand their own experiences, how
          these radical experiences have transformed their lives, and how the
          healer's beliefs and healing practices are globalized and localized in
          different ways in the West.

          "This book does what all good ethnographies do: it tells gripping
          stories. Rocha has a gift for taking simple moments between people and
          showing how complex they really are."--L.L. Wynn, The Australian
          Journal of Anthropology"Rocha's book is richly detailed and
          persuasive... [H]er ability to integrate a variety of relevant
          concepts and theoretical frames into her analysis is exceptional. The
          book is clearly written and engaging, and the analysis is original and
          valuable. Highly recommended for specialists, for libraries, and for
          students and scholars of religion interested in Latin American
          religions, religious healing, spirit incorporation traditions, and/or
          the globalization of religions."--Steven Engler, Religion"This book
          does what all good ethnographies do: it tells gripping stories. Rocha
          has a gift for taking simple moments between people and showing how
          complex they really are, informed by a range of philosophies and
          belief systems as well as a global political economy. But
          fundamentally, this book is a deeply respectful account of people's
          beliefs that never reduces them to a placebo effect or false
          consciousness, even as it shows the structures underpinning their
          pilgrimages."--The Australian Journal of Anthropology"This is one of
          the most insightful and engaging accounts of spiritual healing in
          recent years. By focusing on one of the most intriguing spiritual
          healers of our time, Jo√£o de Deus, Rocha illuminates the enduring
          relevance, despite significant secularization in the West, of curing
          through faith. This book belongs on the top shelf of everyone
          interested in 21st-century religion, spirituality and globalization."

          Skeleton Saint
