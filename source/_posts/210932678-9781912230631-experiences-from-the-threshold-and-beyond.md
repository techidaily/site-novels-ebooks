          'There is a physical world, which we all accept as real, but there is
          also a spiritual world, which interpenetrates this material world and
          is its cause and foundation. Between these two worlds exists a
          threshold that can be felt, seen clairvoyantly, traversed and passed
          through by anyone with a real desire to do so... At this threshold
          there is a guardian, whose task is to stop humans from passing across
          it unprepared...' – From the IntroductionBased on first-hand
          knowledge, Are Thoresen offers insights into the meaning of the
          threshold to the spiritual world. He describes his own experiences in
          encountering this threshold and going beyond it. But there are many
          thresholds to the spiritual world, he says, and many ways to pass them
          – as there are many aspects to the 'guardian of the threshold' and
          versions of the so-called 'animals at the threshold'. The worlds
          beyond, too, have a variety of different constructions – or, as the
          Bible says: 'In my Father's house are many mansions'.The author
          describes the methods and techniques for opening the spiritual sense
          organs required to cross the threshold, and clarifies the differences
          between Imagination (seeing spiritual 'pictures'), Inspiration
          (understanding those pictures) and Intuition (living 'inside' the
          spiritual reality). Structuring the book on his own biography,
          Thoresen conveys many of the lessons he has learnt through decades of
          familiarity with the invisible dimensions. However, he warns that
          there is only one good reason to attempt to cross the threshold, and
          that is to serve God and humanity in the name of love. If we do it out
          of curiosity, or to enhance our personal development, it would be
          better not to try.
