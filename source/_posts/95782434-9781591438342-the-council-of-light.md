          Galactic teachings and practices to raise your vibrational energy and
          create a life of joy, abundance, and ease <br />
          <br />• Provides direct transmissions of spiritual technology from the
          Council of Light to activate the 10 Rays of Light <br />
          <br />• Reveals that by shifting your consciousness and raising your
          inner vibration, you can change your daily life experience and
          manifest the life you want <br />
          <br />• Includes guided journeys and exercises to manifest health,
          wealth, happiness, and purpose and to form a direct connection with
          the Council of Light <br />
          <br />Through her advanced spiritual work with Thoth, Danielle Rama
          Hoffman was introduced to the Council of Light--an intergalactic group
          of thousands of light beings from across the Multiverse. Their purpose
          is to support individuals as they shift into unity consciousness and
          return to their natural state of joy. The Council transmitted the
          teachings in this book for those seeking to accelerate their journey
          toward health, wealth, happiness, and their soul’s deepest desires.
          <br />
          <br />The Council’s teachings reveal that by shifting your
          consciousness and raising your inner vibration, you can change your
          daily life experience and manifest the life you want. These direct
          transmissions of spiritual technology from the Council include
          activations for the 10 Rays of Light, guided journeys and meditations,
          and written, spoken, energetic, and breathwork exercises to creatively
          turn your debt into wealth, transfigure your food into light for
          better health and well-being, enhance your abilities for
          interdimensional travel, and return to your natural inner state of
          joy. The Council explains how each Ray of Light has a specific
          vibration and application and can assist in removing any blocks to
          achieving your soul’s purpose. The Emerald Ray, for example, activates
          the signature energy of your authentic and full self, and the Venus
          Ray, the Ray of Opulent Bliss, supports alignment with abundance and
          prosperity. <br />
          <br />Offering an opportunity to form a direct connection with the
          Council of Light, this book provides practical tools to move from a
          life of worry, debt, exhaustion, and isolation to one of joy,
          abundance, purpose, ease, and connectedness, with a team of Divine
          supporters to assist you along the way.
