          Using real-life stories, scientific concepts, and awareness tools,
          <i>The Book of Calm</i> challenges the constraints of inevitable
          change and turbulent events with a dynamic stance of clarity,
          compassion, and choice. Transitions expert Nancy G. Shapiro moves
          gracefully and deliberately through subjects as diverse as welcoming
          paradox, fierce self-care, power and conversation, and the difficult
          task of connecting with others when faced with our thousand-fold
          differences―providing convincing evidence that people stuck in fear or
          indecision can experience profound insights, break harmful habits, and
          move into their own wisdom by letting go of old beliefs. Inspiring and
          compelling, <i>The Book of Calm</i> supports readers to reimagine and
          renew their lives and their place in the world by transforming
          patterns within thoughts, language, and behaviors―one person, one
          family, one community at a time.

          ><br /><br />“<i>The Book of Calm</i> by Nancy G. Shapiro is an
          extensively researched and intelligently written text that offers
          guidance and support for creating a life infused with calm. The book’s
          friendly storytelling tone provides a layer of comfort, while its
          extensive use of scientific research gives the writing even more
          credibility. Chapters are short yet provide just enough material in
          the way of stories, research, and thoughtful suggestions to be
          thoroughly contemplative before they are moved forward from. Even the
          book’s cover evokes a feeling of tranquility."<br />—Clarion
          Reviews<br /><br />"A book that provides messages to help readers
          maintain calmness amid the many external and internal factors that
          stand in the way. . . . Shapiro uses a variety of effective tools to
          present her ideas—including stories, poetry, and scientific research .
          . . its eloquent ideas should satisfy an audience seeking
          tranquility.”<br />—<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br /><br />“Readers will
          learn to break the habits that limit their potential . . . to make
          choices with clarity, face the fears that make them utterly
          vulnerable, and to connect deeply with themselves and others.
          <i>The Book of Calm</i> is a very relevant book . . . that most of us
          need in today’s challenging, fast-paced environment.”<br />—<i
            >Readers Favorite</i
          ><br /><br />“Here is a book as necessary for today as breath. Shapiro
          is a great storyteller, and she guides us out of the dark woods of
          fear, self-doubt, and powerlessness and into the calm within
          chaos—huge subjects that she masters in a personal way so the reader
          can definitely say, ‘I can do it.’”<br />—Perie Longo, Santa Barbara
          Poet Laureate and author of&nbsp;<i>Baggage Claim</i><br /><br />“In
          <i>The Book of Calm</i>,&nbsp;Nancy Shapiro&nbsp;elegantly interweaves
          personal experience with the hard-won wisdom of growth and
          transformation. These gracious offerings are shared through meaningful
          stories, research, insights, and images. This is a generous book, with
          a quiet yet unmistakable call to nurture your own
          soul.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />—Elizabeth Rosner, author of

          dearest friend, tea in hand, feeling heard, held, and lifted. With
          practical tools, inspirational wisdom, and evocative storytelling,
          Nancy deftly guides you through the unpredictable thickets of
          turbulent living and into the clear, refreshing wellspring of calm.”
