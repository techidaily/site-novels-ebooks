          An exploration of the wild spirits that once roamed the lands and
          inhabited the waters and the pagan rites used to gain their good will
          <br />
          <br />• Explores medieval stories and folk traditions of brownies,
          fairies, giants, dragons, will-o’-the-wisps, and demons <br />
          <br />• Explains the specific rites performed to negotiate with the
          local spirits and ensure their permission before building on new land
          <br />
          <br />• Shows how these beliefs carried through to modern times,
          especially in architecture <br />
          <br />Our pagan ancestors knew that every forest has brownies and
          fairies, every spring its lady, and every river malevolent beings in
          its depths. They told tales of giants in the hills, dragons in the
          lakes, marshes swarming with will-o’-the-wisps, and demons and wild
          folk in the mountains who enjoyed causing landslides, avalanches, and
          floods. They both feared and respected these entities, knowing the
          importance of appeasing them for safe travel and a prosperous
          homestead. <br />
          <br />Exploring medieval stories, folk traditions, spiritual place
          names, and pagan rituals of home building and site selection, Claude
          Lecouteux reveals the multitude of spirits and entities that once
          inhabited the land before modern civilization repressed them into
          desert solitude, impenetrable forests, and inaccessible mountains. He
          explains how, to our ancestors, enclosing a space was a sacred act.
          Specific rites had to be performed to negotiate with the local spirits
          and ensure proper placement and protection of a new building. These
          land spirits often became the household spirit, taking up residence in
          a new building in exchange for permission to build on their territory.
          Lecouteux explores Arthurian legends, folk tales, and mythology for
          evidence of the untamed spirits of the wilderness, such as giants,
          dragons, and demons, and examines the rites and ceremonies used to
          gain their good will. <br />
          <br />Lecouteux reveals how, despite outright Church suppression,
          belief in these spirits carried through to modern times and was a
          primary influence on architecture, an influence still visible in
          today’s buildings. The author also shows how our ancestors’ concern
          for respecting nature is increasingly relevant in today’s world.

        <p>
          “<i>Demons and Spirits of the Land</i> is a scholarly investigation of
          the spirits present in the traditional landscape of Europe. Claude
          Lecouteux explains how humans are inseparable from our surroundings:
          we are not the only intelligent beings, for we cohabit the Earth with
          other sentient entities. Traditionally, these entities manifest as
          land spirits who take many forms: giants, dwarves, brownies, fairies,
          and dragons. Present in the land, they must be dealt with if humans
          are to live in harmony and well-being. This book details rites and
          ceremonies of coming to terms with the spirits of tree and forest,
          spring and mountain, taken from comprehensive documentary and folklore
          sources, including ancient authors, Arthurian legends, medieval
          romances, and Norse sagas. If you want to know about the nature of
          land spirits and how we relate to them, this is essential reading.”
