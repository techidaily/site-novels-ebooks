          Horses, Heartache and Healing is an authentic story written from the
          heart by a woman of great depth and wisdom. The story of wild born
          horses, rescued from drought and certain death is a fascinating tale.
          Elizabeth takes the reader on a first hand journey to Outback
          Australia and then into another realm of healing, growth and personal
          development through the way of the horse. In sharing her experiences -
          the joy, laughter and tears - Elizabeth explains how equine
          facilitated learning offers unique therapeutic benefits to anyone
          blessed to have interactions with horses.The story beings in 2005 when
          a group of horse lovers from Margaret River, a small town in the south
          west of Western Australia, heard about some unique heritage brumbies
          that were at risk of dying out completely due to severe drought. The
          horses were discovered on Earaheedy Station in outback country further
          north. Led by veterinarian Dr Sheila Greenwell this group of people
          decided to prevent this loss. During the course of the year two rescue
          missions were undertaken and 19 horses were saved. The horses were
          special; everyone who met them knew that. Their genetics had not been
          altered in over 60 years and they retained many desirable
          characteristics that had been bred out in modern bloodlines. The Waler
          Horse Society of Australia, after a long investigation and assessment
          period, approved the horses as foundational Waler stock, confirming
          what the Margaret River folk had known all along. One of those people
          was Elizabeth Denniss, a young woman whose marriage had just ended and
          who was about to move to a new town to start a new job. Elizabeth had
          dreamed of owning her own "silver brumby" ever since reading Elaine
          Mitchell's Silver Brumby series as a child. In a gigantic leap of
          faith Elizabeth took the opportunity to purchase Earaheedy Sophie, a 4
          month old orphaned filly found starving and dehydrated with her
          half-sister, Earaheedy Lilly. So began a unique partnership and
          journey that was destined to lead both Sophie, and Elizabeth to
          emotional healing and wholeness. Sophie was Elizabeth's comfort and
          constant companion through challenging times including six years of
          watching her brother battle mental illness and repeated suicide
          attempts. Elizabeth was Sophie's lifeline and guardian through
          emotional and physical life threatening episodes which have led them
          both to a place where they now offer other people the unique
          opportunity to experience personal growth, development and healing
          through the power of equine facilitated learning and coaching
          programs.
