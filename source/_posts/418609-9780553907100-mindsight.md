            >From a pioneer in the field of mental health comes a groundbreaking
            book on the healing power of "mindsight," the potent skill that
            allows you to make positive changes in your brain–and in your
            life.</b
          ><br /><br /><b>Foreword by Daniel Goleman, author of&nbsp;</b
          ><i><b>Emotional Intelligence</b><br /><br /></i>• Is there a memory
          that torments you, or an irrational fear you can't shake?<br />• Do
          you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to
          calm down?<br />• Do you ever wonder why you can't stop behaving the
          way you do, no matter how hard you try?<br />•&nbsp;Are you and your
          child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable
          pattern of conflict?<br /><br />What if you could escape traps like
          these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn't mere
          speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on
          clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician,
          Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the
          integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using
          case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the
          proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention
          on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change
          the wiring and architecture of their brain. <br /><br />Through his
          synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to
          everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have
          helped hundreds of patients. And now he has written the first book
          that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create
          our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes
          <br /><br />• a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses
          meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional
          storms that made him suicidal<br />• a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who
          uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood
          accident, the source of her dread<br />• a physician–the author
          himself–who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a
          "vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart
          and my gut," and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf
          because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear
          infection<br />• a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a
          meditation that is "like watching myself from outside myself" and,
          using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive
          behaviors that have been tormenting her<br /><br />These and many
          other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us
          master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest
          potential.

          "Integrating ancient contemplative practice with contemporary
          neuroscience and psychotherapy, Dan Siegel removes the veil on the
          mysteries of the interface between mind, brain and relationships with
          novel and profound descriptions of how we become who we are, what
          makes things go wrong and how all of us can achieve optimal well being
          by using our capacity for attention to change the very structure and
          function of our brains. Weaving the narrative of his own life, his
          intellectual and clinical journey and the experiences of his clients
          through his explanation of deep clinical theory and sophisticated
          practice, he has written a book that reads like a mystery
          novel."—Harville Hendrix, Ph. D., author of
          <i>Getting The Love You Want: A Guide for Couples</i><br /><br />"<b
            >Mindsight</b
          >
          is a rare book. Rooted in groundbreaking scientific research and
          searching professional practice, it is also a deeply compassionate and
          human account of what it is to be human. <b>Mindsight </b>has powerful
          lessons for doctors, parents and educators, and for all of us who are
          trying to make sense of how we make sense of things."—Sir Ken
          Robinson, author of
          <i>The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything</i
          ><br /><br />"This exciting book reveals the secrets of the mind that
          we have sought in Eastern and Western thought for 2000 years. How do
          we see the mind and learn to tame it for a happier and healthier life?
          Filled with engaging stories, <b>Mindsight </b>uses cutting edge
          science and deep humanity to address the questions that we all have
          about the mystery in our skull." –Natalie Goldberg, author of
          <i>Old Friend from Far Away</i> and <i>Writing Down the Bones<br /></i
          ><br />"In this brilliant and highly readable book, Dan Siegel
          combines his prodigious knowledge of brain science, clinical
          psychology and mindfulness with his immense capacity for original
          thinking to develop a new and useful concept—mindsight. An intrepid
          navigator of the vast sea inside us all, he maps the territory and
          offers amazing insights into how to benefit from the journey. His work
          will forever change the way we understand ourselves and our
          relationships."—Dr. Mary Pipher, author of
          <i>Seeking Peace: Chronicles of the Worst Buddhist in the World</i
          ><br /><br />"In his new, graceful, wise, creative, utterly
          approachable book, <b>Mindsight,</b> Dr. Daniel J. Siegel integrates
          two of the most important discoveries of our time: the cutting-edge
          research into the brain functions relevant to understanding our
          emotions, and the discovery that our brains are plastic and can grow
          and change through properly guided mental activity. Through beautiful
          and often remarkable case histories, he shows us the principles we can
          use to better understand ourselves and, more often than we might
          imagine, change our minds, brains, relationships, some lifelong
          character traits, and even the course of some important mental
          illnesses."—Norman Doidge, M.D., author of
          <i>The Brain That Changes Itself</i><br /><br />"An extraordinary and
          practical wedding of neuroscience and spiritual wisdom. Accessible and
          visionary, <b>Mindsight</b> is bound to be a classic." –Jack
          Kornfield, author of <b>The Wise Heart</b><br /><br />"<b
            >Mindsight </b
          >is a literary MRI: a mind-blowing book that will change the way you
          think about the way you think."—Arianna Huffington<br /><br />"Dr.
          Daniel Siegel is one of the most thoughtful, eloquent, scientifically
          solid and reputable exponents of mind/body/brain integration in the
          world today."—Jon Kabat-Zinn, Ph.D., author of
          <b>Wherever You Go, There You Are</b> and
          <b>Full Catastrophe Living</b><br /><br />"A daring plan of action for
          a wiser and kinder life."—Diane Ackerman, author of
          <i>The Zookeeper' s Wife</i><br /><br />"Right now, Dan Siegel is
          creating a stir among therapists unmatched by any other in the field.
          <i>Mindsight</i> offers a fascinating synthesis of his innovative
          ideas about the implications of the new brain science for
          understanding relationships and the processes of human
          change."—Richard Simon, Ph.D., editor, <i>Psychotherapy Networker</i
          ><br /><br />"Drawing upon and explaining the intricate workings of
          the brain,<b> </b>Mindsight sets itself apart from other self-help
          books. Dr. Siegel helps the reader understand how we can change our
          dysfunctional habits of mind and become more flexible, adaptive,
          coherent, energized, and stable. He helps us see that we can rewire
          our own brains and become truly integrated, through personal
          understanding and, most important, through meaningful relationships
          with others. This is a must-read for anyone who wishes to have a
          happier, more productive life."—Eugene Beresin, M.D., professor of
          psychiatry at Harvard Medical School<br /><br />"<b>Mindsight </b>is a
          seminal piece on bringing neuroscience to everyday life, helping us to
          understand what can go awry in the mind so that, armed with that
          knowledge, we will be better able to change. The book is a wonderful
          journey from the mind through the brain and the body and then back
          again. Siegel's use of elaborate personal as well as patient stories
          makes us feel as though we are on a guided tour with a friendly group
          of fellow travelers." —John J. Ratey, M.D., author of
          <i>Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain</i>
