        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Louise Hay </b>was an inspirational teacher, incredible visionary,
          and self-help pioneer who educated millions since the 1984 publication
          of her bestseller, <b><i>You Can Heal Your Life</i></b
          >, which has more than 50 million copies in print worldwide and spent
          16 weeks on the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers list. She appeared
          on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> and many other TV and radio programs
          both in the U.S. and abroad. Renowned for demonstrating the power of
          affirmations to bring about self-healing and positive change, Louise
          was the author of more than 30 books, including the bestsellers
          <b><i>The Power Is Within You </i></b>and<b><i> Heal Your Body</i></b
          >. In addition to her books, Louise produced numerous audio and video
          programs, card decks, online courses, and other resources for leading
          a healthy, joyous, and fulfilling life. Louise was dubbed “the closest
          thing to a living saint” by the Australian media and in 1985, Louise
          began her famous support group, “<b>The Hayride</b>,” with six men
          diagnosed with AIDS. By 1988, the group had grown to a weekly
          gathering of 800 people and had moved to an auditorium in West
          Hollywood. In 1987, what began as a small venture in the living room
          of her home turned into <b>Hay House, Inc.</b>: the largest publisher
          of self-help books, events, and courses. Hay House has sold millions
          of books and products worldwide and now has offices in California, New
          York, London, Sydney, Johannesburg, and New Delhi.<b>
            The non-profit Hay Foundation</b
          >, established by Louise in 1986, continues to support organizations
          that enhance the quality of life for people, animals, and our
          environment. Websites: www.louisehay.com, www.hayhouse.com, and
