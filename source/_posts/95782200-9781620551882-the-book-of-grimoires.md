          An extensive study of ancient books of magic and the magical practices
          preserved in the few surviving grimoires <br />
          <br />• Includes spells, talisman formulations, and secret magical
          alphabets reproduced from the author’s private collection of
          grimoires, with instructions for their use <br />
          <br />• Explains the basic principles of medieval magic, including the
          doctrine of names and the laws of sympathy and contagion <br />
          <br />• Offers an overview of magic in the Western Mystery tradition
          <br />
          <br />Grimoires began simply as quick-reference “grammar books” for
          sorcerers, magicians, and priests before evolving into comprehensive
          guides to magic, complete with spell-casting rituals, magical
          alphabets, and instructions to create amulets and talismans. With the
          advent of the printing press, some grimoires were mass produced, but
          many of the abbreviations were misinterpreted and magical words
          misspelled, rendering them ineffective. The most powerful grimoires
          remained not only secret but also heavily encoded, making them
          accessible only to the highest initiates of the magical traditions.
          <br />
          <br />Drawing on his own private collection of grimoires and magical
          manuscripts as well as his privileged access to the rare book archives
          of major European universities, Claude Lecouteux offers an extensive
          study of ancient books of magic and the ways the knowledge within them
          was kept secret for centuries through symbols, codes, secret
          alphabets, and Kabbalistic words. Touching on both white and black
          magical practices, he explains the basic principles of medieval magic,
          including the doctrine of names and signatures, mastery of the power
          of images, and the laws of sympathy and contagion. He gives an
          overview of magic in the Western Mystery tradition, emphasizing both
          lesser-known magicians such as Trithemus and Peter of Apono and famous
          ones like Albertus Magnus and Hermes Trismegistus. <br />
          <br />Creating a universal grimoire, Lecouteux provides exact
          reproductions of secret magical alphabets, symbols, and glyphs with
          instructions for their use as well as an illustrated collection of
          annotated spells, rituals, and talismans for numerous applications
          including amorous magic, healing magic, and protection rites. The
          author also examines the folk magic that resulted when the high magic
          of the medieval grimoires melded with the preexisting pagan magic of
          ancient Europe.

          “A grimoire is a textbook of magic that typically include instructions
          on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to
          perform magic spells, charms, and divination, and how to summon the
          dead or supernatural spirits. This book is a far-reaching study of
          magical books and shares the techniques and instructions mentioned
          above. The book is well documented and extensive, though not
          exhaustive. It isn't really for the novice but one with a deep
          interest in magical arts.”
