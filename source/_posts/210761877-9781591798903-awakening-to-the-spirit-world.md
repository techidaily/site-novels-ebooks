            Today, practicing shamanism doesn’t mean you have to live in a rain
            forest or a desert. Thanks to a modern renaissance of shamanic
            spirituality, practitioners from all walks of life now use powerful
            indigenous techniques for healing, insight, and spiritual growth.<br />With
            <i>Awakening to the Spirit World</i>, teachers Sandra Ingerman and
            Hank Wesselman bring together a circle of renowned Western shamanic
            elders—Tom Cowan, Carol Proudfoot-Edgar, José Stevens, and Alberto
            Villoldo—to present a comprehensive manual for making these
            practices accessible and available in our daily lives, including:<br />How
            the original practice of shamanism shaped the world’s spiritual
            traditions and why it is still relevant todayThe art of the shamanic
            journey—a time-tested meditative method for experiencing important
            spiritual lessons and truthsGuidance for avoiding common pitfalls of
            shamanic practiceInstruction for working with your dreams,
            connecting to your spirit guides, healing yourself and your
            environmentDrumming tracks to facilitate your shamanic journeys
