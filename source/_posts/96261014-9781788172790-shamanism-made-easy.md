            >Reconnect with your authentic self and bring meaning back into your
            life with the ancient, time-tested wisdom of shamanism.</b
          ><br /><br />This book is a fantastic and comprehensive introduction
          to shamanism by a leading expert and teacher on the subject. Shamanism
          is the oldest and most enduring spiritual wisdom tradition on Earth.
          It offers powerful practices for healing and finding wholeness, and is
          appealing to a whole new generation of spiritual seekers.
          <br /><br />Shamanism Made Easy, written by a much loved university
          psychotherapist and shamanic teacher, explains the subject in a clear
          and easily digestible format, and shows why these deeply
          transformative techniques are so needed in our challenging times.
          <br /><br />In this book, the reader will learn, amongst many things,
          how to build an altar and create a sacred space, conduct ceremonies
          and design a daily ritual, connect with spirit helpers, ancestors and
          descendants, and use dance as a tool for awakening and freedom. Above
          all, readers will learn what it is like to undergo transformative
          journeys for personal healing and development. <br /><br />This book
          was previously published within the Hay House Basics series.

          “Within minutes of meeting Christa Mackinnon, I knew she was the real
          deal and that she was some incarnation or embodiment of ancient
          knowledge here to inspire healing and transformation in all of those
          she works with. Christa’s book <i>Shamanism Made Easy</i> was like
          medicine to me and as soon as I had it in my hands I could feel my
          soul being replenished and supported. I believe in Christa and her
          mission; her loving attention to ethics, sustainability and making a
          difference is an inspiration to the world. May Christa’s sacred work
          enrich your life.”<br /><b>Kyle Gray</b>,
          bestselling&nbsp;author&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>Raise Your&nbsp;Vibration</i>,
          <i>Angel Prayers&nbsp;and Light Warrior&nbsp;</i><br /><br />“This
          book is essential reading for beginners, but also very interesting for
          people like me who have walked for a long time on the path of
          shamanism. I love the way in which Christa explains the fundamentals
          of shamanism but also gives psychological and scientific perspectives
          on what is happening in your brain while you practice. For people new
          to shamanism, you will find many techniques to begin your shamanic
          practices, and experienced people like me will find beneficial
          explanations from somebody that has been combining psychotherapy with
          shamanism in an amazing way in her practice and her life.”<br /><b

          >, author&nbsp;of <i>The&nbsp;Toltec&nbsp;Secret&nbsp;</i>and
          <i>Caves&nbsp;of Power&nbsp;</i><br /><br />“This book is a must for
          anyone who wishes to explore shamanism and understand how it can be
          used in modern day life. Written by a highly experienced modern-day
          Medicine Woman and inspiring shamanic teacher, it is easy to read,
          clear, authentic and informative. I particularly love the practical
          ideas suggested and have included them in my own work. A book I return
          to again and again.”<br /><b>Vanessa&nbsp;Tucker</b>, author&nbsp;of
          <i>The&nbsp;Art&nbsp;of You&nbsp;</i>and Founder&nbsp;of ‘WalK
          your&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;Retreats’<br /><br />“Any wise seeker,
          particularly one who wants to explore the vast inner and outer realms
          of expanded consciousness, needs an experienced and ethical guide they
          can trust. Christa Mackinnon stands out as one of them and
          <i>Shamanism Made Easy</i> is the perfect guidebook for those taking
          their first steps into the great mystery that waits for us all.”<br /><b
