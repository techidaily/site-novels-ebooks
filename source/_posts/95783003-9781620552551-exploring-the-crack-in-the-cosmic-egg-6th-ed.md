          The classic follow-up to the bestselling
          <i>The Crack in the Cosmic Egg </i> <br />
          <br />• Explains the process of acculturation and the mechanisms that
          create our self-limiting “cosmic egg” of consensus reality <br />
          <br />• Reveals how our biological development innately creates a
          “crack” in our cosmic egg--leaving a way to return to the unencumbered
          consciousness of childhood <br />
          <br />• Explores ways to discover and explore the “crack” to restore
          wholeness to our minds and reestablish our ability to create our own
          realities <br />
          <br />In this classic follow-up to his bestselling
          <i>The Crack in the Cosmic Egg</i>, Joseph Chilton Pearce explains the
          process of acculturation and the mechanisms that create our
          self-limiting “cosmic egg” of consensus reality. <br />
          <br />Laying the groundwork for his later classic
          <i>Magical Child</i>, Pearce shows that we go through early childhood
          connecting with the world through our senses. With the development of
          language and the process of acculturation not only do our direct
          experiences of the world become much less vivid but our innate states
          of nonordinary consciousness become suppressed. Trapped in a specific
          cultural context--a “cosmic egg”--we are no longer able to have or
          even recognize mystical experiences not mediated by the limitations of
          our culture. Motivated primarily by a fear of death, our enculturation
          literally splits our minds and prevents us from living fully in the
          present. <br />
          <br />Drawing from Carlos Castaneda’s writings about Don Juan and the
          sense of “body-knowing,” Pearce explores the varieties of nonordinary
          consciousness that can help us return to the unencumbered
          consciousness of our infancy. He shows that just as we each create our
          own cosmic egg of reality through cultural conditioning, we also
          innately create a “crack” in that egg. Ultimately certain shifts in
          our biological development take place to offset acculturation, leaving
          an avenue of return to our primary state. Pearce examines the creation
          of the “egg” itself and ways to discover its inherent cracks to
          restore wholeness to our minds, release us from our fear of death, and
          reestablish our ability to create our own realities through
          imagination and biological transcendence.

          “…Pearce’s transcendent work still motivates us to explore the true
          nature of ourselves and creation, and is as relevant today in a world
          dominated by a sociocultural mata-program as it was when it was first
          written about in 1971.”
