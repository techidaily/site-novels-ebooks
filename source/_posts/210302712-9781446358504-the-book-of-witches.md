            >The early twentieth-century witchcraft classic that “attacks with
            infinite zest what is perhaps the most fascinating combination of
            subjects in the wide world” (<i>The New York Times</i>).</b
          ><br /><br />The Book of Witches is not an “exhaustive treatise on
          witches and witchcraft” but rather “a picture from which a general
          impression may be gained.” Oliver Madox Hueffer shows where witches
          have come from and why, “what she was and is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how
          necessary she is and must be to the happiness of mankind, and how
          great the responsibility of those who, disbelieving in her themselves,
          seek to infect others with their scepticism.”<br /><br />Divided into
          16 chapters, Hueffer explores a variety of subjects within witchcraft,
          from witches’ attributes to representations of witches in England,
          Rome and Greece, as well as persecutions of witches, philters, charms
          and potions, and modern witches in the 19th century.<br /><br /><i

        <p>
          <b>Oliver Madox Hueffer</b> (1877 - June 22, 1931), was an author,
          playwright, and war correspondent. Oliver was the younger brother of
          the English novelist, poet, critic and editor, Ford Madox Ford. Often
          described as an exaggerated version of Ford, Hueffer had an erratic
          career and became involved in financial and sexual exploits resembling
          those that haunted his more famous brother--to the point where certain
          characters and plot details in Hueffer's novels could be loosely based
          on the life of either brother. Oliver published eight volumes of
          fiction under his own name between 1901 and 1931 and five as ‘Jane
          Wardle’ 1907-10. His brother wrote that he had ‘run through the
          careers of Man About Town, Army Officer, Actor, Stockbroker, Painter,
          Author and under the auspices of the father of one of his fiancées,
          that of Valise Manufacturer’. Badly wounded in the First World War, he
          lived afterwards in Versailles.
