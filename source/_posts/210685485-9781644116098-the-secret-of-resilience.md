          ><br /><br />• Shares the author’s journey of learning the healing art
          of Jin Shin, discovering the embryological roots of resilience, and
          healing her own trauma<br /><br />• Explores how the Jin Shin sites
          correlate with the Chinese Extraordinary Meridians and with specific
          embryological events<br /><br />• Shows how subtle touch in
          combination with trauma resolution amplifies neuroresilience, enhances
          creativity, restores motivation, and heals the fragmentation and
          disconnection associated with trauma and shock<br /><br />When
          neuroscientist Stephanie Mines started practicing the hands-on healing
          Art of Compassion, she began to unravel the mystery of trauma and the
          secret to resilience. As a survivor of early childhood abuse, police
          brutality as a social justice activist, and a series of dysfunctional
          and abusive relationships, Mines was profoundly curious about how the
          human nervous system finds resilience despite the cumulative burden of
          chronic stress and traumatic life events. While earning her doctorate
          in neuropsychology, she met Mary Iino Burmeister, master of the Art of
          Compassion, or Jin Shin Jyutsu. Art of Compassion consists of
          non-invasive touch, using the fingertips, on sites of the body that
          are similar to acupuncture points. <br /><br />After the Art of
          Compassion helped Mines resolve her own trauma and awaken her innate
          resilience, she began to incorporate it into her clinical research.
          She discovered that the map of the body she learned from Burmeister
          sites correlated with the Chinese Extraordinary Meridians or Rivers of
          Splendor, which develop prenatally. She then began investigating our
          earliest neurodevelopmental processes and was able to correlate the
          Extraordinary Meridians with specific embryological events. She found
          that subtle touch on these sites in combination with trauma resolution
          amplifies neuroresilience, enhances creativity, restores motivation,
          and heals the fragmentation and disconnection associated with trauma
          and shock. <br /><br />Sharing her personal journey as a Wounded
          Healer, Mines reveals not only how to unlock the secrets of resilience
          for individual healing but also how embodied resilience will help us
          heal our wounded planet.

          “It is so rare and precious to find a teacher who prefers not to tell
          you things, so much as sing you into a new realm of knowledge and
          vision. Stephanie Mines is a dancer: she dances from the most
          touchingly and disarmingly personal to the grandest visions for
          humanity’s potential future. She calls us fearlessly to a homecoming,
          a necessary return to our ecstatic inner core: our limitless source of
          vitality and renewal. I’ve learned so much from this tender and
          compassionate book. It’s exactly the book humanity needs today.”
