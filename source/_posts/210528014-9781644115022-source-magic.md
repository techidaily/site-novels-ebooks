            >An exploration of how magic can be found within all human
            activities</b
          ><br /><br />• Offers a “magical-anthropological” tour from ancient
          Norse shamanism to the modern magick of occultists like Genesis
          P-Orridge<br /><br />• Looks at how human beings are naturally
          attracted to magic and how this attraction can be corrupted by both
          religious organizations and occult societies<br /><br />• Examines
          magic as it relates to psychedelics, Witchcraft, shamanism,
          pilgrimage, Jungian individuation, mortality, and the literary works
          of Beat icons like Burroughs and Gysin<br /><br />Since the dawn of
          time, magic has been the node around which all human activities and
          culture revolve. As magic entered the development of science, art,
          philosophy, religion, myth, and psychology, it still retained its
          essence: that we have a dynamic connection with all other forms of
          life. <br /><br />Exploring the source magic that flows beneath the
          surface of culture and occulture throughout the ages, Carl Abrahamsson
          offers a “magical-anthropological” journey from ancient Norse
          shamanism to the modern magick of occultists like Genesis P-Orridge.
          He looks at how human beings relate to and are naturally attracted to
          magic. He examines in depth the consequences of magical practice and
          how the attraction to magic can be corrupted by both religious
          organizations and occult societies. He shows how the positive effects
          of magic are instinctively grasped by children, who view the world as
          magical. <br /><br />The author looks at magic and occulture as they
          relate to psychedelics, Witchcraft, shamanism, Thee Temple ov Psychick
          Youth (TOPY), the panic rituals of the Master Musicians of Joujouka in
          Morocco, psychological individuation processes, literary “magical
          realism,” and the cut-up technique of Beat icons like William S.
          Burroughs and Brion Gysin. He explores the similarities in psychology
          between poet Ezra Pound and magician Austin Osman Spare. He looks at
          the Scandinavian Fenris Wolf as a mythic force and how personal
          pilgrimages can greatly enrich our lives. He also examines the
          philosophy of German author Ernst Jünger, the magical techniques of
          British filmmaker Derek Jarman, and the quintessential importance of
          accepting our own mortality. <br /><br />Sharing his more than 30
          years of experiences in the fields of occulture and magical
          anthropology, Carl Abrahamsson explores ancient and modern magical
          history to reveal the source magic that connects us all, past and
          present.

          “Carl Abrahamsson is a rare voice of lucidity in the complex world of
          magic. He explains the most profound and esoteric knowledge in a way
          that just keeps the pages turning and the ideas flowing. Reading
          Abrahamsson is like starting a fire deep within the imagination that
          continues to warm the spirit long after reading.”
