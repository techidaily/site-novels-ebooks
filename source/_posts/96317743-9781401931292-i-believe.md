            >What is the foundation underpinning success in all areas of life?
            Is there a blueprint? <br />What if you learned that your beliefs
            were the very cornerstones that supported success, and that having a
            few of these could give rise to success in some areas while complete
            failure in others?&nbsp;<br />
            Would you choose to build a stronger overall foundation?</b
          ><br /><br />Very few people today doubt the power of positive
          thinking. We all know that if we expect to fail, then failure is
          inevitably what we get, and there is also the issue of the mind/body
          connection—science is repeatedly demonstrating the power of mind and
          belief to heal. What you believe can and does have a huge impact on
          the quality of your life—from success in business to success in
          relationships, from your ability to learn and master new subjects to
          your ability to heal your own body. But have you ever stopped to
          consider your own beliefs—to truly examine them and decide for
          yourself if they are serving you or sabotaging you?<br /><br /><b
            >Eldon Taylor</b

          has spent over 25 years researching the power of the mind and
          developing scientifically proven methods to use this power to enhance
          the quality of your life. <i>I Believe</i> is a book that will not
          only inspire you, but will highlight the kinds of beliefs you hold
          that may be causing you to fail. In the process, it will provide you
          with the opportunity to choose, once again, the beliefs that drive
          your life.

          “The ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus taught his students that what
          happens to them is not as important as what they believe happens to
          them. In this engaging and provocative book, Eldon Taylor provides his
          readers with specific ways in which their beliefs can lead to success
          or failure in their life undertakings. Each chapter provides nuggets
          of wisdom as well as road maps for guiding them toward greater
          self-understanding, balance, responsibility, and compassion.” —
          <b>Stanley Krippner, Ph.D.</b>, Alan Watts Professor of psychology and
          humanistic studies, Saybrook University, and co-author of
          <i>Personal Mythology</i><br /><br />“<i>I Believe</i> is an inspiring
          book that shows you all the benefits of choosing your beliefs
          carefully.” — <b>John Gray, Ph.D.</b>,
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus<br /><br /></i>“A new view
          of mind and consciousness is arising from within science and
          psychology. This emerging picture honors the power of belief, meaning,
          and purpose, and brings with it stunning possibilities of human
          potential. Eldon Taylor’s <i>I Believe</i> is a no-nonsense invitation
          to experience this domain for yourself. This book deserves a wide
          readership, especially for anyone who’s interested in
          self-responsibility and prevention in health. In the end, it’s this
          vision that will turn around our nation’s faltering health care, which
          makes this book all the more important.” — <b>Larry Dossey, M.D.</b>,
          author of <i>Reinventing Medicine</i>, <i>Healing Words</i>, and
          <i>The Power of Premonitions<br /><br /></i>“Most of us live life
          according to the story of who we think we are. Past wounds,
          disappointments, poor choices, and a gnawing awareness that we are not
          living life to its maximum potential in a state of harmony and joy are
          a direct result of this self-limiting myth. In this book, Eldon Taylor
          encourages us to activate the inner reservoir of our untapped
          potential and to question our prior beliefs and patterns of behavior.
          Creating a ‘new’ story can liberate us to become our most authentic
          selves and to celebrate the miracle and adventure of life, in a world
          of infinite possibilities.” — <b>Annamaria Hemingway, Ph.D.</b>,
          author of <i>Practicing Conscious Living</i> and
          <i>Dying and Myths of the Afterlife<br /><br /></i>“For inestimable
          millennia, global human-race consciousness has typically tended toward
          embracing fear and worry as a way of life and often all but forgetting
          the true and only power of love, as amplified by personal, conscious
          awareness of one’s Divine Self. Dr. Taylor’s newest book clearly
          demonstrates that there truly is an emerging trend to return to this
          Divine awareness. This is exemplified in his intelligent, caring
          language, ideas, and methods to help the reader to achieve subtle but
          powerful spiritual awareness to dissolve the fear while finding
          personal balance in one’s life. Promoting ‘love is the great
          equalizer,’ his obvious appreciation of being a curious and vibrant
          human, immersed in a joyful, supportive universe, brings delightful
          buoyancy to the pages, transmitting his inescapable exuberance and
          positivity to the reader.” — <b>August Goforth</b>, author of
          <i>The Risen: Dialogues of Love, Grief &amp; Survival<br /><br /></i
          >“The author deftly weaves insights, humor, questions, and personal
          anecdotes into a humanized worldview that’s extremely readable,
          entertaining, and informative. Since we all unfold our human lives out
          ‘into’ the beliefs we have, this book is a very useful road map for
          how to live both gracefully and authentically. Highly recommended.” —
          <b>Chuck Hillig</b>, author of <i>Enlightenment for Beginners</i> and
          <i>Seeds for the Soul<br /><br /></i>“In straightforward Eldon
          fashion, you’ll learn how to plug into all you desire, and you’ll
          understand why you may have been the source of your sabotage. Whether
          it’s a matter of relationships or wellness, prosperity or
          self-satisfaction, this book will open a new vista of understanding
          solidly connected to scientific evidence. You’ll read it and re-read
          it, sharing its valuable content with everyone you love.” —
