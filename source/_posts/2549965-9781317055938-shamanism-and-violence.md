          Proposing a new theoretical framework, this book explores Shamanismâ€™s
          links with violence from a global perspective. Contributors, renowned
          anthropologists and authorities in the field, draw on their research
          in Mongolia, China, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, India, Siberia, America,
          Papua New Guinea, Taiwan to investigate how indigenous shamanic
          cultures dealt, and are still dealing with, varying degrees of
          internal and external violence. During ceremonies shamans act like
          hunters and warriors, dealing with many states related to violence,
          such as collective and individual suffering, attack, conflict and
          antagonism. Indigenous religious complexes are often called to respond
          to direct and indirect competition with more established cultural and
          religious traditions which undermine the sociocultural structure, the
          sense of identity and the state of well-being of many indigenous
          groups. This book explores a more sensitive vision of shamanism,
          closer to the emic views of many indigenous groups.

          Diana Riboli is a lecturer in Social Anthropology at Panteio
          University, Greece. She has been carrying out ethnographic research
          among the Chepang of Central and Southern Nepal and she is currently
          directing a research project among the Semang-Negrito of Peninsular
          Malaysia. She is the author of Tunsuriban. Shamanism in the Chepang of
          Southern and Central Nepal (2000) and of numerous articles and essays
          on shamanism, indigenous concepts of health and illnesses, altered
          states of consciousness and strategies for survival of indigenous
          cultures. Davide Torri is a researcher at the Asia-Europe Cluster of
          Excellence, Karl Jaspers Centre for Advanced Transcultural Studies at
          the University of Heidelberg, Germany. He studied Hindi language and
          Hinduism at the University of Venice. After his dissertation on the
          Lepchas of Sikkim, he dedicated himself to the anthropology of
          religion and to the study of shamanism among indigenous communities of
          India, Nepal, and Mongolia. In particular, he is specialised in the
          study of Himalayan indigenous and minority groups. He wrote several
          papers on shamanism and forms of syncretism between South Asian
          indigenous cultures, Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity. Having done
          fieldwork in Nepal during the Civil War and the following peace
          process, he developed an interest in conflicts dynamics, politics and
          patterns of change affecting small-scale societies.
