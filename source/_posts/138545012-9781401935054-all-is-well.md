          ><br /><br />In this healing tour de force, best-selling authors
          Louise L. Hay and Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz have teamed up for an exciting
          reexamination of the quintessential teachings from
          <i>Heal Your Body. All Is Well</i> brings together Louise’s proven
          affirmation system with Mona Lisa’s knowledge of both medical science
          and the body’s intuition to create an easy-to-follow guide for health
          and well-being. And, for the first time ever, they present scientific
          evidence showing the undeniable link between the mind and body that
          makes these healing methods work.<br /><br />Bringing focus and
          clarity to the effects of emotions on the body,
          <i>All Is Well</i> separates the body into seven distinct groups of
          organs – or emotional centers – that are connected by their
          relationship to certain emotions. Structured around these emotional
          centers, the authors outline common imbalances and probable mental
          causes for physical illness. They also include case studies that show
          a complete program for healing that draws from all disciplines,
          including both traditional and alternative medicine, affirmations,
          nutritional changes, and so much more.<br /><br />Using the
          self-assessment quiz, the holistic health advice, and an expanded
          version of Louise’s original affirmation chart, you can learn how to
          heal your mind and body with affirmations and intuition and live a
          balanced, healthy life.

          “<i>All Is Well&nbsp;</i>is simply excellent. Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz has
          blended her expertise in health with the healing wisdom of Louise Hay,
          one of the leading icons of the human consciousness community. This
          book is a tribute to the intuitive genius of Louise, whose work as a
          role model for positive thinking pioneered healing first for people
          with AIDS and then for countless others.”&nbsp;<br /><b

            >Archetypes: A Beginner’s Guide to Your Inner-net</i
          >&nbsp;<br /><br />“In today’s world of too much information and too
          little wisdom, there is very little that gets to the heart of any
          matter—especially regarding health. But&nbsp;<i>All Is Well</i>does
          just that by combining medical science and intuition. As a former RN,
          I insist on the latest medically proven scientific evidence when
          looking after my own health. But I also honor my story, my personal
          experiences, and my unique sense of intuition; I use these to inform
          my ability to find inner peace, health, and balance in everyday life.
          This book takes this same approach, and so when I started to read, I
          began to feel better immediately. If you read only one book about
          health this year, this is the one for you!”<br /><b

          Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz—interlaced with each other so effortlessly.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Louise Hay (Author) Louise Hay </b>was an inspirational teacher,
          incredible visionary, and self-help pioneer who educated millions
          since the 1984 publication of her bestseller,
          <b><i>You Can Heal Your Life</i></b
          >, which has more than 50 million copies in print worldwide and spent
          16 weeks on the <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers list. She appeared
          on <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> and many other TV and radio programs
          both in the U.S. and abroad. Renowned for demonstrating the power of
          affirmations to bring about self-healing and positive change, Louise
          was the author of more than 30 books, including the bestsellers
          <b><i>The Power Is Within You </i></b>and<b><i> Heal Your Body</i></b
          >. In addition to her books, Louise produced numerous audio and video
          programs, card decks, online courses, and other resources for leading
          a healthy, joyous, and fulfilling life. Louise was dubbed “the closest
          thing to a living saint” by the Australian media and in 1985, Louise
          began her famous support group, “<b>The Hayride</b>,” with six men
          diagnosed with AIDS. By 1988, the group had grown to a weekly
          gathering of 800 people and had moved to an auditorium in West
          Hollywood. In 1987, what began as a small venture in the living room
          of her home turned into <b>Hay House, Inc.</b>: the largest publisher
          of self-help books, events, and courses. Hay House has sold millions
          of books and products worldwide and now has offices in California, New
          York, London, Sydney, Johannesburg, and New Delhi.<b>
            The non-profit Hay Foundation</b
          >, established by Louise in 1986, continues to support organizations
          that enhance the quality of life for people, animals, and our
          environment. Websites: www.louisehay.com, www.hayhouse.com, and

            >Mona Lisa Schulz (Author)
          </b>
          Dr. Schulz believes that all of us were born with intuitive ability
          and the capacity to read energy fields, but that this innate ability
          gradually diminishes over time because it has been culturally feared
          and devalued instead of cultivated. One of the many joys in her life
          is teaching healthcare professionals and others how to acknowledge,
          trust, and develop their own intuitive skills.
