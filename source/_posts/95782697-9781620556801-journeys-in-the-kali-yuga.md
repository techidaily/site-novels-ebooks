          A beautifully evocative account of one man’s odyssey to discover
          authentic and unbroken magical traditions in the East and reawaken
          them in the West <br /><br />• Details the author’s encounters with
          the Naga Babas, his initiation into their tradition, and his
          experience at the Kumbh Mela, the largest spiritual gathering on Earth
          <br /><br />• Shares the similarities he discovered between the
          teachings of the Indian tradition and the Western traditions of magic,
          alchemy, and pagan pantheons <br /><br />• Introduces a wide cast of
          characters, including Goa Gil, the world-renowned guru of the Goa
          techno-trance scene, and Mahant Amar Bharti Ji, a “raised-arm Baba,”
          who for more than 40 years has held up one arm in devotion to Shiva
          <br /><br />Beautifully detailing his spiritual pilgrimage from West
          to East and back again, in the age of strife known as the Kali Yuga,
          Aki Cederberg shares the authentic and unbroken magical traditions he
          experienced in India and Nepal and how his search for a spiritual
          homeland ultimately led him back to his native Europe.
          <br /><br />Cederberg explains how his odyssey began as a search for
          spiritual roots, something missing in the spiritually disconnected
          life of the Western world, where the indigenous traditions were long
          ago severed by the spread of Christianity. Traveling to India, he
          encounters the ancient esoteric order of mystic, wild, naked holy men
          known as the Naga Babas, the living source of the Hindu traditions of
          magic and yoga. Immersing himself in the teachings of the tradition,
          he receives an initiation and partakes in the Kumbh Mela, the largest
          spiritual gathering on Earth. With his evocative descriptions,
          Cederberg shows how traveling in India can be an overwhelming, even
          psychedelic experience. Everything in this ancient land is multiplied
          and manifold: people and things, sights and sounds, joy and suffering.
          Yet beyond the apparent confusion and chaos, a strange, subtle order
          begins to reveal itself. He starts to glimpse resemblances and
          analogies between the teachings of the Indian tradition and the
          Western traditions of magic, alchemy, and pagan pantheons. He meets a
          wide cast of characters, from mystical hucksters in Rishikesh and the
          veritable army of naked, chillum-smoking mystics of Maya Devi to Goa
          Gil, the world-renowned guru of the Goa techno-trance scene, and
          Mahant Amar Bharti Ji, an <i>urdhvabahu</i> or “raised-arm Baba,” who
          for more than 40 years has held up one arm in devotion to Shiva.
          <br /><br />After extensive traveling and immersing himself in the
          extraordinary world of India, Cederberg returns to his native soil of
          Europe. Traveling to holy places where old pagan divinities still
          linger in the shadows of the modern world, he dreams of forgotten gods
          and contemplates how they might be awakened yet again, reconnecting
          the West with its own pre-Christian spiritual traditions, sacred
          landscapes, and soul.

          "Aki Cederberg’s<i> Journeys in the Kali Yuga</i> is a unique addition
          to a very long and venerable tradition of travel writing by Westerners
          who have spent time in the East. This book is recommended for anyone
          who wants to know modern India, and still more to benefit from the
          experiences of a serious seeker on the path to a better understanding
          of himself and his genuine, rooted identity."
