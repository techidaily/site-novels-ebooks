            >Prominent spiritual counselor and medium Anna Raimondi channels the
            Blessed Mother in this “insightful and inspirational guide to modern
            spirituality” (<i>In Touch Weekly</i>) that is a celebration of Mary
            as an inspirational figure for all people and religions across the
            globe.</b
          ><br /><br />At age five, in the backyard of her suburban home, Anna
          Raimondi had a profound experience. A contemplative child, she slid
          her body into the small grotto that once held a statue of the Blessed
          Mother. Anna remembers “a feeling of pure and unadulterated peace.” In
          that peace, she heard a voice. It was gentle and strong, and it said,
          “Anna, I am here for you always. Always come to me.” That was the
          beginning of their first conversation. And while many more followed,
          the ones included in this book took place in the last year and follow
          Mary’s emphatic, progressive message that she wants to be heard by
          all, regardless of religious affiliation.<br />
          <br />
          Through Anna, Mary touches and teaches important truths about:<br />
          <br />
          - <i>A soul</i>, its immortal nature and the lessons along each soul’s
          journey.<br />
          <br />
          - <i>Prayer</i>, its power, the right way to pray, and the difference
          between surrendering to God and not taking responsibility for one’s
          actions.<br />
          <br />
          - <i>What happens when we die</i>, with revelations into the realities
          of heaven, hell, purgatory, and reincarnation.<br />
          <br />
          Mary also provides insightful answers to questions about terrorism,
          the world’s refugee crisis, racism, gender inequality, marriage
          equality, and more. Her "conversations with Anna are simultaneously
          illuminating, and provocative,” and she “offers wisdom and solace for
          all” (<i>HuffPost</i>).
