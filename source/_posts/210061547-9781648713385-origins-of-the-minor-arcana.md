            Origins of the Minor Arcana, the first volume in the&nbsp;Learn
            Authentic Tarot series, presents the true story behind the ancestry
            of the Tarot's much-neglected Minor Arcana, which is to be found in
            the symbolism, culture, and gaming traditions of Asia and the Middle
            East. In doing so, it abolishes the numerous occult myths
            surrounding the Tarot that have been promulgated from the late 18th
            century right up to the present day. Origins of the Minor Arcana
            provides a new foundation by which to understand the development of
            the Tarot, one grounded in historical scholarship and careful
            research.Set against the backdrop of humankind as Homo symbolicus
            (symbolic man) and Homo ludens (playful man), this volume
            illustrates how the gradual evolution of symbolic expression,
            together with the integral nature of play in human culture,
            ultimately led to the invention of playing cards and their
            transmission across the Eurasian landscape and into Europe. These
            early ancestors served as the foundation for the creation of all
            European playing cards, including the Tarot, and are the source of
            its four-suit system.Lavishly illustrated and beautifully presented,
            this volume contains a sizable collection of stunning color photos,
            including a full presentation of the Tarot's direct ancestors: the
            Chinese Money cards and the Mamluk deck. Heavily researched, but
            eminently readable, this scholarly account of the Tarot's Minor
            Arcana is the definitive work on the early, formative history of the
            Tarot.

          "It is rare that I find a book on Tarot that teaches me something new
          about the cards. Origins of the Minor Arcana is one of those books. I
          have not read such a well-researched and thorough explanation behind
          the origin of cards in China, how they were reinterpreted in Persia,
          and then again in Egypt. A thoroughly enjoyable read."&nbsp;

          "The chief merit of Hoshour's book is to provide, in concise and
          vividly-illustrated chapters, the intersection of the Tarot with the
          history of playing cards. What makes this book indispensable to the
          expert as well as the beginner, is its centerpiece: the most detailed
          and thorough discussion of the famous Mamluk cards currently
          available. All of it is, of course, superbly illustrated with
          photographs of the original cards as well as the recent luxuriantly
          recreated version of Ulrich Kaltenborn. An indispensable guide to the
          early history of the Tarot."&nbsp;

          &nbsp;"Tarot history books don't come along very often that are
          beautifully illustrated, exciting to read and stuffed to the gills
          with fascinating facts. This book fits all those criteria as it dives
          deeply into a neglected aspect of playing card history. In this book,
          the pip cards are given their due. &nbsp;This very readable book is
          meticulously researched and beautifully illustrated. The images of
          historic games and fragments of little-known decks are a delight.
          Numerous maps, graphs and timelines put everything in context. This
          book leaves me in awe of Tarot's deep roots in the past."
