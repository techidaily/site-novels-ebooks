          An exploration of the use of cannabis as a sacrament in spiritual
          practice <br /><br />• Provides instructions for using marijuana for
          the spiritual practices of spontaneous movement, ecstatic dance,
          sitting meditation, and gazing meditation, allowing you to open the
          body’s energies more fully and get closer to the Divine or your higher
          self <br /><br />• Includes a new translation of the Five Moral
          Precepts of Buddhism, adapted to include energetic practices and the
          judicious use of entheogenic substances as a legitimate support for
          spiritual growth <br /><br />• Includes access to 9 audio meditations
          <br /><br />With the end of marijuana prohibition on the horizon,
          people are now openly seeking a spiritual path that embraces the
          benefits of cannabis. Drawing upon his decades of experience as a
          teacher of Buddhism, breathing, yoga, and embodied spirituality, Will
          Johnson examines Eastern spiritual perspectives on marijuana and
          offers specific guidelines and exercises for integrating cannabis into
          spiritual practice. <br /><br />The author explains how the great
          Hindu god Shiva enjoyed consuming bhang, a marijuana mixture that
          would cause his body to make spontaneous movements. From these
          cannabis-inspired movements, Shiva brought the body-focused practices
          of dance and yoga to the world. Examining the spiritual path of Shiva,
          including the Sadhu tradition, Johnson provides specific instructions
          and protocols for using marijuana as a sacrament as Shiva did. He
          explores how to embrace cannabis for the practices of spontaneous
          movement, ecstatic dance, sitting meditation, and gazing meditation.
          He reveals how the ecstatic surrender to the feeling energies of the
          body in these practices is enhanced through the ingestion of Shiva’s
          herb, allowing you to open the body’s energies more fully and get
          closer to the Divine or your higher self. <br /><br />Exploring the
          Buddhist practices of calming the mind and grounding yourself in
          sensory awareness, Johnson shows that, while traditional Buddhist
          teachings forbid the use of intoxicating substances, Buddhists who use
          cannabis are not committing a cardinal sin--in following our dharma,
          we must embrace what best supports our spiritual practice. He
          concludes with a new translation of the Five Moral Precepts of
          Buddhism--what he calls the Five Precepts of Embodied
          Responsibility--adapted to include energetic practices using breath,
          interaction with the energies of nature, sacred sex, and the judicious
          use of entheogenic substances, such as cannabis, as legitimate support
          for spiritual growth.

          “Will Johnson has a clear understanding of the human ‘mindbody,’ how
          we limit ourselves, how we can free ourselves from those limitations
          to awaken to unconditioned reality, and how cannabis can play a
          valuable role in that awakening journey when used skillfully. His
          articulation of these central human concerns is as clear as his
          understanding. <i>Cannabis in Spiritual Practice </i>seamlessly blends
          principle and practice into accessible, applicable guidance.”
