            People may be familiar with the celebrations around Chinese New Year
            (usually towards the end of January or beginning of February) and
            how the year is devoted to a particular animal. As with the more
            commonly known form of astrology, there are 12 signs (such as the
            ox, the rabbit, the dragon and the tiger), but these signs are also
            combined with a 60-year calendar and the five elements of metal,
            wood, water, fire and earth to form a fascinating and unique system
            that gives insight into people's characters and considers how they
            will be affected during different years of the calendar's cycle.<br /><br />Drawing
            on the principles of yin and yang and the Chinese philosophical
            theory of the three harmonies, this fascinating work is a wonderful
            introduction to the subject.

          Kay Tom graduated as a Chue Style Feng Shui consultant in 1999 and was
          awarded the title of Master in Chinese Horoscope CH, Yuen Hom Hexagram
          Feng Shui YHH, and Auspicious Date Selection DS in 2006/2007 by her
          master, Grand Master Chan Kun Wah. She is passionate about her subject
          and travels worldwide from her base in the Midlands, UK, in her
          endeavors to enhance the wellbeing of others through consulting in
          both the residential and commercial sectors.<br />Kay is a respected
          authority in her field and writes extensively in a wide range of
          publications including the Mail Online and the South China Morning
          Post in Hong Kong. She is interviewed regularly on radio stations
          including BBC Radio Leicester, Talk Radio's Badass Women's Hour, and
          Radio New Zealand. She is a teacher, public speaker, and Chairman of
          the Chue Foundation.<br />Grand Master Chan belongs to the Chue
          Lineage that dates to 960AD, the Song Dynasty, through the Imperial
          Courts of China. The unique quality of Chue is that all knowledge has
          been gained through the direct word of a master to his student,
          knowledge that has been previously extensively researched, making Chue
          Style Feng Shui second to none in both quality and validity.
