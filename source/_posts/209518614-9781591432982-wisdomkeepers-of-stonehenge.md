          Reveals how Stonehenge was an extraordinary astronomical calendar used
          in the cultivation of ingredients for long-forgotten botanical cures
          <br /><br />• Explores how Stonehenge and other stone circles were
          ancient healing sanctuaries and celestial calculators for the
          preparation of natural medicines <br /><br />• Explains how the
          megalithic priesthood--and their successors, the Druids--developed
          astonishing memory techniques to preserve knowledge over generations
          <br /><br />• Draws upon the very latest discoveries from recent
          archaeological excavations and overlooked historical source material
          <br /><br />Stonehenge is just one of thousands of stone circles
          erected throughout Britain and Ireland for over three millennia from
          3,000 BC on. How did this building tradition survive for so long, over
          such a large area and with such complexity and uniformity, when the
          people of the British Isles lived in separate, isolated communities
          and left no evidence of a central leadership or obvious communication
          network? <br /><br />Graham Phillips argues that these stone circles
          are evidence of an astonishing system of healthcare and preservation
          of ancient medical knowledge that held together a society scattered
          across the British Isles. With stones aligned to the sun, moon, and
          certain stars, these ancient monuments enabled the precise timings
          necessary for the cultivation of medicinal plants. He explains how the
          megalithic priesthood possessed medical knowledge well beyond their
          time and may even have discovered a cure for cancer. Furthermore,
          because they had no form of writing, the megalithic people developed
          phenomenal memory techniques to preserve their knowledge over many
          generations, resulting in a class of wisdomkeepers that were not only
          healers but the living libraries of their culture. <br /><br />Drawing
          upon the latest discoveries from recent archaeological excavations and
          overlooked historical source material, Phillips reveals that the
          megalithic culture survived far longer than previously thought and
          that the people who held it together were an enigmatic shamanic sect
          ultimately called the Druids. Uncovering the secrets of ancient
          megalithic culture and the purpose of their enigmatic stone circles,
          Phillips contends that all the evidence has now been gathered to
          unlock the secrets encoded in the stones--and perhaps discover
          remedies for diseases still uncured by modern medicine today.
