          <p>
            This book came about upon a request made by a friend, on how to
            perform a demon binding operation (or evocation), which is also
            known by the Ancient Greek derived name “Goetia.” This friend had
            read Crowley’s 1904 co-edited publication
            <strong>The Book of the Goetia of Solomon the King</strong>; but was
            struggling with the concepts and with its magical operations. At
            first, as I have a background in medieval and religious history, I
            believed that the task would be a simple one, that is, to simply
            unpack Crowley’s work with the aim of interpreting and simplifying
            it for my novice friend. However, Crowley’s work itself became a
            challenge to grasp; thus sparked an interest within me, and started
            a journey with its own discovery. Along the way I teamed-up with
            Antony Lawrence who brought his background in graphics and design to
            this book’s artwork, and also contributed to its research and
            writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our research we found that demon binding has a long history and
            many traditions. The tradition that Crowley’s book fell within the
            Western magic esoteric tradition: the Western Qabalah; kept alive
            mainly through magical manuscripts known as grimoires. In their
            original medieval form these were hand-written texts for
            professional magicians. The grimoires only contained the most
            essential information, as much was left out. In short, the grimoires
            in their raw state were incomplete. When the printing revolution
            took hold at the end of the medieval period, the grimoires
            resurfaced as published texts. However, these published grimoires
            remained incomplete and because of this, their magic maintained its
            mysterious quality. Over time they gained a reputation for being
            dark and dangerous; but this was more to do with attempted
            demon-binding with an incomplete magical technology, making the
            risks greater than would otherwise be if it were complete.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crowley was aware of this hazard. In his co-edited publication on
            the Goetia, he not only relied on original manuscripts, but also
            included a vital operation for the invocation of the Divine.
            Moreover, while Crowley added much he also was careful not to offer
            complete operations; as he sought to separate the serious minded
            from dabblers. Given the value of Crowley’s research, his Goetia was
            quickly plagiarized by others. Not surprisingly, Crowley did not
            publish another work of this kind again. Unfortunately, the many
            publications, since Crowley’s seminal 1904 Goetia, have added little
            to make the work complete and easily accessible.
          </p>
          <p>
            In writing our book we have approached Goetia with Crowley’s zeal
            for research, basing our work on credible sources, and sought to
            complete the task that Crowley started. To do this, we have broken
            the Goetia down into its classic operations, with each operation
            given an introductory chapter that explains its purpose. Maintaining
            the work's authenticity to its magic Qabalah tradition, Latin
            headings are used for each operation. This allows each operation to
            be easily identified and differentiated. In brief, these are the
            Consecratio, Invocatio, Evocatio, Ligatio, and the Licentia. The
            Consecratio provides the necessary litanies for sacralising
            yourself, your ritual space, and all material things required.
            Following this is the Invocatio, where you invoke the Divine; and
            open a dimensional portal to evoke the demon. The Evocatio provides
            you with the essential Evocatory Calls for evoking the demon. On
            making contact, the Ligatio arms you with the binding litanies to
            bind the demon to your specific intent. Once this is effected, the
            ritual is completed with the Licentia, where you perform banishing
            litanies, close the dimensional portal, and finally re-cleanse your
            ritual space.

            As a bonus this is brought together in a user guide called,
            QuickStart Goetia Ritual, which is located at the back of this book.
