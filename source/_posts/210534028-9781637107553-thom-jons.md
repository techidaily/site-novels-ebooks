            What is universal reality? Is this world interested in a realistic
            vision of what life is like beyond death?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Is our world curious about how an understanding of a realistic
            presentation of heaven might impact our lives in this age of
            alternative truth, unreality, entrenched self-interest, and systemic
            racism?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Would individuals be interested in a narrative about our universe
            that is neither a Star Wars fantasy nor a fiction perpetrated by
            religionists with a social/religious agenda? Would anyone have an
            interest in discovering what universal teachers or resurrected
            beings might say to us beyond the veil of death?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Is racism, evil, hate, cheating, greed, lying, murder, rape,
            selfishness, and etcetera something that is okay with our universe?
            If it is, then the very concept of eternal life has no meaning and
            is utterly inviable. We humans of the Planet of the Cross have known
            this for well over two thousand years. So why are these issues such
            a problem on our planet today? Are our universal leaders pleased
            with our progress?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            We live in an age where our greatest human handicap is our lack of
            understanding of our ascendant future and the reality of our
            universal lives. On earth, we are embryonic souls locked within the
            limits of the womb. From earth, we pass into universal infancy. What
            happens when our eyes open?
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Premise: "There are as many paths to the Portals of Paradise as
            there are Ascending Pilgrims going there. Each ascenders path is
            utterly unique. Any religious practice that believes that it has the
            'one and only truth' speaks more in arrogance than in the knowledge
            of universal truth." This fictional work reflects on our mortal
            lives from the perspective of unseen universal beings and from the
            experiences of ascenders who have passed through the veil of human
            death. As all beings are the children of our Mother/Father God, all
            are truly equal siblings; "there is no racial supremacy because
            there are no racists in heaven." This novel calls for the
            cultivation of genuine human equality through the end of systemic
            racism. It suggests a new perspective on ascendant living for mortal
            beings.

            Plot : The narrative covers the progression of life in a Southern
            American town during the first three decades of the twentieth
            century. The characters experience social divisions, poverty, World
            War I, pandemic, prohibition, suffrage, clerical rape, lynching, gay
            marriage, economic collapse, and systemic racism. The story is
            presented from the perspective of a diverse cast of characters
            ranging from judges, politicians, hoodlums, teachers, businessmen,
            soldiers, wealthy whites, lower-class whites, and folks from a
            colored community. Their lives are reflected upon by their guardian
            angels and unseen universal teachers. Part 1 covers the lives of
            folks around Thom Jons, a war hero and entrepreneur who gradually
            descends into rejecting life by demanding death. Part 2 begins after
            the dispensational resurrection of the souls onto Mansion One. All
            the resurrected characters protest that Thom Jons had failed to be
            resurrected. They demand and win a tribunal before Melchizedek to
            convince Thom to be born into the reality of ascendant eternal life.
            After introductions by Melchizedek, the tribunal consists of the
            reflections of each ascender on their earthly lives, Thom's positive
            mortal legacy, and their experiences, lessons, and new perspectives
            learned after their resurrection. They invite Thom to join them in
            the adventure of universal progress, spiritual development, and an
            ever-evolving living faith. For they have understood the experience
            of the Ascendant Will of God in the fulfillment of their personal
            spiritual assignments by God the Father and their communal service
            experience with the Eternal Mother.
