          A grand survey of the world’s death and afterlife traditions
          throughout history <br />
          <br />• Examines beliefs from many different cultures on the soul,
          heaven, hell, and reincarnation; instructions for accessing the
          different worlds of the afterlife; how one may become a god; and how
          ethics and the afterlife may not be connected <br />
          <br />• Explores techniques to communicate with the dead, including
          séance instructions <br />
          <br />• Includes an extensive bibliography of more than 900 sources
          from around the world <br />
          <br />Drawing on death and afterlife traditions from cultures around
          the world, Mark Mirabello explores the many forms of existence beyond
          death and each tradition’s instructions to access the afterlife. He
          examines beliefs on the soul, heaven, hell, and reincarnation and
          wisdom from Books of the Dead such as the Book of Going Forth by Day
          from Egypt, the Katha Upanishad from India, the Bardo Thodol from
          Tibet, the Golden Orphic Tablets from Greece, Lieh Tzu from China, and
          <i>Heaven and its Wonders</i> and
          <i>Hell from Things Heard and Seen</i> from 18th-century Europe.
          <br /><br />Considering the question “What is Death?” Mirabello
          provides answers from a wide range of ancient and modern thinkers,
          including scientist Nicholas Maxwell, the seer Emanuel Swedenborg,
          1st-century Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna, and Greek philosopher
          Euripides, who opined that we may already be dead and only dreaming we
          are alive. He explores the trek of the soul through life and death
          with firsthand accounts of the death journey and notes that what is
          perceived as death here may actually be life somewhere else. He
          reveals how, in many traditions, ethics and the afterlife are not
          connected and how an afterlife is possible even without a god or a
          soul. Sharing evidence that consciousness is not simply a product of
          the brain, he offers a strong rebuttal to nihilists, materialists, and
          the Lokayata philosophical school of India who believe in the
          “finality” of death. He explains how specters and ghosts are produced
          and offers techniques to communicate with the dead as well as
          instructions for an out-of-body experience and the complete procedure
          for a séance. <br />
          <br />With an extensive bibliography of more than 900 sources, this
          guide offers comprehensive information on afterlife beliefs from the
          vast majority of cultures around the world and throughout history--a
          veritable “traveler’s guide” to the afterlife.
