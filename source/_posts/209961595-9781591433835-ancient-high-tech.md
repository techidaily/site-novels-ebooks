          A detailed look into ancient advanced technology, science, and
          medicine--some of which has yet to be reproduced today <br /><br />•
          Explores countless examples of ancient high tech, including robotics,
          artificial intelligence, aircraft, solar-powered cannons, high-speed
          drills, illuminated underground temples, massive refrigerators, and
          subterranean cities <br /><br />• Examines evidence of advanced
          medicine in ancient times <br /><br />• Includes examples from ancient
          Egypt, China, Greece, Babylon, Siberia, the Americas, and India
          <br /><br />The first self-igniting match was invented in 1805 by Jean
          Chancel, a French chemist. Yet, in Babylon, 3,600 years before,
          identical sulfur matches were in common use. On the Panchavarnaswamy
          Temple in India, built millennia ago, there is a detailed carving of a
          man on a bicycle, yet the bicycle wasn’t invented in the modern world
          until 1817. These inventions are only two examples of technology lost
          in the Dark Ages. <br /><br />Exploring the sophisticated tech
          achieved by ancient civilizations hundreds and thousands of years ago,
          Frank Joseph examines evidence of robotics and other forms of
          artificial intelligence; manned flight, such as hot-air balloons and
          gliders; and military science, including flamethrowers, biological
          warfare, poison gas, and solar-powered cannons. He reveals how ancient
          construction engineers excavated subterranean cities, turned stone
          walls into glass, lifted 100-ton blocks of granite, illuminated
          underground temples and pyramids, and stored their food in massive
          refrigerators. <br /><br />Examples explored in the book include the
          first known alarm clock, invented by Plato in 4th-century-BC Greece;
          600-year-old Aztec whistles that reproduce animal sounds and human
          voices with uncanny accuracy; Stone Age jewelry from Siberia worked by
          a high-speed drill; sex robots in ancient Troy, Greece, and China;
          ancient Egyptian aircraft; and India’s iron pillar exposed to sixteen
          hundred years of monsoons but still standing rust-free. The author
          also explores evidence of advanced medicine in ancient times,
          particularly in Egypt and China, from brain surgery, optometry, and
          prosthetics to dentistry, magnet therapy, and cancer cures.<br /><br />By
          examining the achievements of our ancient ancestors, we can not only
          reverse-engineer their inventions but also learn from their
          civilizations’ mistakes, enabling us to avoid more dark ages. Imagine
          how scientifically advanced humanity would be if our early
          achievements had escaped destruction and been allowed to develop?

          the significance of the evidence for themselves and reflect on our
          continuing destructive tendencies embodied in technology that make us
          a danger to ourselves.”
