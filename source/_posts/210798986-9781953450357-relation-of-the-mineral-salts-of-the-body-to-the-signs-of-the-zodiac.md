            Dr. George Washington Carey's 1932 work Relation of the Mineral
            Salts of the Body to the Signs of the Zodiac unites homeopathy and
            astrology to explain both the causes and cures of human disease. Dr.
            Carey's unique blend of chemistry, physiology, religion, and
            astrology has made him a popular writer in homeopathic circles since
            the early 20th century.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Dr. Carey's work was greatly influenced by the experiments of
            another contemporary doctor, Wilhelm Heinrich Schüßler. Dr. Schüßler
            was the first to identify the twelve "cell-salts," which Dr. Carey
            expounds on further in Relation of Mineral Salts.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Dr. Carey is perhaps best known for his "Chemistry of Life"
            publications, released in the 1910s. These works are still popular
            in New Age circles. In The Chemistry of Human Life (1919), Dr. Carey
            originated the idea that the human body is a "chemical formula in
            operation," and without each chemical in the correct amount, the
            formula will no longer create the desired effect - a healthy and
            vibrant person.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Relation of the Mineral Salts of the Body to the Signs of the Zodiac
            expands on this idea and ties these chemical needs to the Zodiac.
            Published posthumously in 1932, this work was co-written with Inez
            E. Perry. Dr. Carey collaborated with Ms. Perry several times before
            his death in 1924.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Relation is Dr. Carey's contribution to a larger two-part work
            titled The Zodiac and the Salts of Salvation. In this short volume,
            Dr. Carey explains that all maladies are due to a deficiency in some
            necessary chemical, or "cell-salt." Just as the "cure" for a shadow
            is to introduce light, the cure for maladies of the human body is to
            introduce some vital element for the nourishing of our blood and
            organs.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            But which cell-salts are we deficient in? That may well depend on
            the position of the sun at our birth - or our Zodiac signs. Dr.
            Carey describes the 12 signs of the Zodiac, including their
            characteristics and the cell-salts that he recommends to cure the
            diseases of each.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            For example, those born between June 21st and July 22nd under the
            sign of Cancer exhibit "tenacity...in holding onto home or dwelling
            place." This is represented by the crab, who has both a tight grip
            and "carries its house along wherever it goes in order that it may
            be sure of a dwelling."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Dr. Carey identifies the salt fluoride of lime (or calcium fluoride)
            as the most important salt for the Cancer. When it is deficient,
            tissue fiber loses its elasticity. Symptoms of this relaxation can
            include varicose veins and interestingly, "a groundless fear of
            financial ruin."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            There are Biblical connections explored as well. Dr. Carey
            associates both the twelve apostles and the twelve sons of Jacob and
            their respective tribes to an astrological sign. Jacob's tenth
            Zebulum, or Zebulun in many modern translations, represents Cancer.
            His name even translates to "dwelling" in Hebrew.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Dr. Carey was not the first to make the connection between the
            twelve sons of Jacob, twelve apostles of Christ, and the Zodiac. In
            fact, Rev. Robert Taylor may have been the first to make this
            connection in the mid-19th century in a series of controversial
            sermons. His ideas were so contentious that he was banned from
            preaching in the United Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The second part of the work, written by frequent collaborator Inez
            E. Perry, is titled Esoteric Analysis and Synthesis of the Zodiacal
            Signs and their Physiochemical Allocations. This volume expands on
            Relation of Mineral Salts and provides guidance for the use of each
            mineral to cure disease and reach a more enlightened spiritual
            state.
