            >One scientist's account of the poltergeist case that made headlines
            across the country -- and the riveting examination of a child's
            mysterious murder.</b
          >
          <br /><br />
          When she was just fourteen years old, Tina Resch became the center of
          the best-documented case of poltergeist activity of the twentieth
          century. During the spring of 1984, Tina's home in Ohio was thrown
          into chaos: appliances turned themselves on without electric current,
          objects flew through the air, furniture scooted across the floor.
          Censured endlessly by her adoptive family and thrust into the eye of a
          media twister thanks to one reporter's photographic evidence of a
          flying phone, Tina was propelled into a downward spiral that led to an
          abusive marriage, a divorce, and the birth of a child -- all before
          her twentieth birthday. Three years later she was charged with that
          child's murder, and she is currently serving a life sentence for a
          crime as controversial, mysterious, and complex as the accused herself
          -- a crime she maintains she did not commit. <br />
          <i>Unleashed</i> is Tina's story as told by a parapsychologist who
          witnessed striking paranormal phenomena in Tina's presence. Examining
          the destructive powers of thwarted emotions from a scientific
          perspective, William Roll sheds remarkable light on the case of Tina
          Resch -- and boldly confronts our cultural responses to events that
          cannot be easily explained.

          Larry Dossey, M.D. author of <i>Healing Words</i> <i>Unleashed</i> is
          a gripping account of that strange, unguarded borderland between mind
          and matter, where thought and emotion explode onto the physical world
          in chaotic, unpredictable ways. <i>Unleashed</i> should come with a
          warning label: MAY FOREVER CHANGE YOUR WORLDVIEW.

        </h4>
        <p>
          William Roll, PhD, (1926-2012) was an Oxford-educated parapsychologist
          on the faculty of the psychology department of the State University of
          West Georgia in Carrollton, Georgia. Over the course of his extensive
          career he wrote four books and more than two hundred scientific
          articles. He has appeared on numerous segments of
          <i>Unsolved Mysteries,</i> as well as on the Discovery Channel and
          other television documentaries. In 1996, Roll received the Outstanding
          Career Award from the Parapsychological Association, and in 2002 he
          received the Tim Dinsdale Memorial Award from the Society for
          Scientific Exploration.
