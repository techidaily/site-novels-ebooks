          "What Abiola Abrams has created within the pages of this book is more
          than just a book; it's a gateway to understanding the profound layers
          of your spiritual journey. From nurturing a thought into a tangible
          outcome, I've seen the Law of Attraction at work, harmonizing with the
          Law of Assumption, as beautifully elucidated in this book. The
          stories, exercises, and insights that Abiola shares are a testament to
          the infinite possibilities that await us when we align our imagination
          with unwavering belief in ourselves and our world.<br /><br />
          This book is a beacon for those who seek to understand the mysteries
          of manifestation. It serves as a reminder that our reality is a
          reflection of our innermost thoughts and beliefs. As you turn each
          page, you'll be invited to explore the depths of your own
          consciousness and unlock the power of your imagination.<br /><br />
          <i>From Imagination to Reality </i>is not just a read; it's an
          experience, a journey that will guide you from the realm of thought to
          the landscape of tangible reality. I am thrilled to introduce you to
          this profound work that aligns so perfectly with the teachings I hold
          so dear. May your journey through these pages be as transformative and
          enlightening as the practice of manifestation itself." - Sarah Prout,
          best-selling author of "Dear Universe",
          <i>Excerpt from Sarah Prout's Foreword</i><br /><br />“In this
          captivating book, Abiola enlightens readers, revealing that it is
          their birthright to transform their<br />
          wildest dreams from imagination to reality.” - Gabrielle Bernstein, #1
          New York Times best-selling author<br /><br />"I first crossed paths
          with Abiola Abrams at Bob Proctor's Modern Day Millionaire conference
          in New York City. I spoke on the main stage, while Abiola spoke in one
          of the breakout rooms. Even in that sea of high-vibration energy,
          Abiola shone brightly. Through her lens, Abdullah’s wisdom reminds us
          that within each of us lies the capacity to transcend our perceived
          limits and manifest our deepest desires. Abiola’s dedication to
          bringing Abdullah’s work to a new generation is both commendable and
          necessary. It is a rare gift to translate ancient truths into
          practical knowledge for the modern seeker, and
          <i>From Imagination to Reality </i>does so with grace and insight.
          Through Abiola and Abdullah’s insights, we are inspired to not only
          recognize the divine in every aspect of the Universe, but to embrace
          our role as creators, shaping a world filled with love, intention, and
          compassion." - Michael Bernard Beckwith, Founder &amp; CEO of Agape
          International Spiritual Center; Author of "Life Visioning" and
          "Spiritual Liberation" &amp; Host of Take Back Your Mind Podcast,

            >From Imagination to Reality</i
          >
          awakens us to the timeless mystic teachings of manifestation and shows
          us how to apply them to our modern-day experiences. Abiola Abrams
          masterfully guides us to unlock our inherent potential, embrace our
          personal power, and live a life beyond our wildest imagination. -
          Marci Shimoff, #1 NY Times best-selling author of "Happy for No
          Reason" and "Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul"<br /><br />"Abiola’s
          book, <i>From Imagination to Reality</i>, came to me in perfect
          timing! That’s how manifestation works. What I embraced from her book
          is everything I wish to express in this world is already inside of me.
          Abiola beautifully weaves the stories of Abdullah’s teachings of
          conscious creation throughout the book and offers exercises to
          practice these experiences ourselves.As we become more aware of the
          teachings of the great wisdom teachers Abiola so clearly recreates in
          her book, it becomes easier to manifest these teachings in our lives.
          I particularly loved, “Manifestation becomes more about uncovering the
          treasure already inside of you and less about chasing your dreams”.
          Abiola’s book spoke to me in ways I was ready to hear!" - Lisa Garr,
          Host and Creator of The Aware Show and author of "Becoming Aware,"
