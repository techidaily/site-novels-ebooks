            Healing the Heart and Mind with Mindfulness is a practical book that
            provides strategies using mindfulness to manage stress, anxiety and
            depression, as well as ways to cultivate psychological wellbeing.
            Uniquely, it combines a traditional Buddhist approach to mindfulness
            with contemporary psychology and current perspectives. Drawing on
            the author’s many years of clinical experience as a psychologist as
            well as his personal experience in Buddhist meditation practices, it
            outlines how the Buddha’s four applications of mindfulness can
            provide a pathway to psychological wellbeing, and how this can be
            used personally or with clinical populations.
          </p>

            This accessible, user friendly book provides strategies for healing
            the heart and mind. <b>Malcolm Huxter</b> introduces mindfulness as
            it is presented in Buddhist psychology and guides the reader through
            meditations in a systematic way. The practices are clearly explained
            and supported by relevant real life stories. Being aware that
            mindfulness and meditation are simple but not easy,
            <b>Huxter </b>guides the reader from the basics of mindfulness and
            meditation through to the more refined aspects. He provides a
            variety of different exercises and guided meditations so that
            individuals are able to access what suits them. The guided
            meditations can be streamed or accessed as
            <b>free audio downloads</b>.

          "This is a wonderful book with many treasures. Written by a clinical
          psychologist, who has been deeply engaged with Buddhist practice for
          many years, his wisdom and experience of both Eastern and Western
          practices clearly shines through. Huxter not only has an extraordinary
          depth of knowledge but is a wonderful writer and makes complex things
          clear. I learnt a lot from this very accessible and wise book and will
          be returning to it many times; it is an illuminating gift to all those
          interested in this area and a must read." –

          "It was become very popular nowadays to "secularize" Buddhism in such
          a way that it is stripped of the depth and richness of the practices
          and theories that are based on the Buddha's teachings and the wisdom
          that has grown from the Buddhist tradition. In a refreshing departure
          from this reductionist tendency, Malcolm Huxter has brought into
          dialogue many core themes of Buddhism with the practical concerns and
          insights of modern psychology. Authentic Buddhist practices and ideas
          have much to contribute to alleviating psychological distress and to
          cultivating exceptional states of mental health and balance, and this
          book has much to offer in this regard." -

          "This is a deeply sincere and touching integration of the core of
          Buddhist wisdom and modern psychology. It’s immediately practical,
          bringing the power of mindfulness and compassion to everyday life, and
          it also contains many guided meditations. Filled with the author’s own
          depth of practice, this is a life-changing book" -

          "For therapists and others who wish to understand the roots of
          mindfulness, look no further. This book beautifully encapsulates the
          traditional literature on mindfulness and is written with the
          sensibility of a real-world psychotherapist and lifelong meditation
          practitioner. Importantly, the author unpacks how mindfulness is
          inextricably related to wisdom, compassion, and ethical behavior. As
          mindfulness goes mainstream, this book will surely be a valuable
          resource for curious minds." -

          "[This] is a useful book. I found myself putting it to use almost
          immediately, and experienced changes in my own attitudes and approach
          to the world as I read through it and put it into practice. The book
          is inspiring... the immediate usefulness of much of the book is
          inspirational in itself.... I found a well-organized and practical
          path of personal discovery and equilibrium." -

          "Unlike many books on mindfulness, Huxter has not divorced mindfulness
          from its roots in Buddhism, and this book provides a very accessible
          introduction to both key Buddhist teachings and the practice of
          mindfulness. Psychological concepts and Buddhist teachings are
          explained and then effectively demonstrated through client stories.
          The book begins with basic teachings but becomes more complex in each
          chapter. As a result, the book has much to offer to a wide range of
          readers including both those new to Buddhism and mindfulness and those
          with prior experience...I am sure this is a book I will return to for
          both the meditations and its general wisdom; I found it valuable for
          my own continuing education and for my spiritual care practice." -<b
