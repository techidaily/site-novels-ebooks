          Overturns the long-established historical narrative about the origins
          and purpose of the Knights Templar <br /><br />• Explains how and why
          the Templars created Europe’s first nation-state, Portugal, with one
          of their own as king <br /><br />• Reveals the Portuguese roots of key
          founding members, their relationship with the Order of Sion, the
          Templars’ devotion to Mary Magdalene and John the Baptist, and the
          meaning and exact location of the Grail <br /><br />• Provides
          evidence of Templar holy sites and hidden chambers throughout Portugal
          <br /><br />• Includes over 700 references, many from new and rare
          sources <br /><br />Conventional history claims that nine men formed a
          brotherhood called the Knights Templar in Jerusalem in 1118 to provide
          protection for pilgrims traveling to the Holy Land. Overturning this
          long-established historical narrative, Freddy Silva shows that the
          Order of the Temple existed a decade earlier on the opposite side of
          Europe, that the protection of pilgrims was entrusted to a separate
          organization, and that, in league with the Cistercian monks and the
          equally mysterious Order of Sion, the Templars executed one of
          history’s most daring and covert plans: the creation of Europe’s first
          nation-state, Portugal, with one of their own as king.
          <br /><br />Including over 700 references, many from new and rare
          sources, Silva reveals Portugal, not Jerusalem, as the first Templar
          stronghold. He shows how there were eleven founding members and how
          the first king of Portugal, a secret Templar, was related to Bernard
          de Clairvaux, head of the Cistercians. The author explains the
          Templars’ motivation to create a country far from the grasp of Rome,
          where they could conduct their living resurrection initiation--whose
          candidates were declared “risen from the dead”--a secret for which the
          Church silenced millions and which the Templars protected to the
          death. <br /><br />Placing the intrepid Knights in a previously
          unknown time and place, Silva’s historical narrative reveals the
          Portuguese roots of key founding members, their relationship with the
          Order of Sion, the Templars’ unshakeable devotion to Mary Magdalene
          and John the Baptist, and how they protected a holy bloodline in
          Portugal. He also provides evidence of secret Templar holy sites,
          initiation chambers, and hidden passageways throughout Portugal, often
          coinciding with pagan and Neolithic temples, and explains how their
          most important site forms a perfect triangle with the Abbey of Mont
          Sion in Jerusalem and the Osirion temple in Egypt. The author also
          reappraises the meaning of the Grail and reveals its exact location,
          hidden in plain sight to this very day.

          “In this well-told story, author Freddy Silva has filled a
          long-standing need for a real understanding of the Templars’ early
          history, their search for treasure in the Temple of Solomon, and the
          creation of an independent Portugal with a Templar knight as king.
          <i>First Templar Nation</i> is a fascinating contribution to the body
          of knowledge of the Order.”
