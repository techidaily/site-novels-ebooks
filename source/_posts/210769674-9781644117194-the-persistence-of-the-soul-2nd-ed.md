            >Compelling evidence for afterlife messages backed by scientific
            research</b
          ><br /><br />• Presents detailed accounts of experiments conducted to
          obtain evidence for the survival of consciousness after death,
          including the author’s own test involving a secret message left behind
          by his late sister<br /><br />• Shares interviews with mediums to
          understand how they receive information from the spirit world and
          explains how to recognize fraudulent mediums<br /><br />• Explores the
          healing impact that afterlife communications can have on people who
          are grieving<br /><br />After the unexpected passing of his youngest
          son, Mark Ireland began a search for messages from the afterlife and
          discovered remarkable proof of life after death.<br /><br />Interweaving
          profound personal experience and compelling scientific evidence,
          Ireland presents a deep dive into psychic-medium phenomena, spirit
          visitations, afterlife communication, reincarnation, synchronicity,
          and near-death experiences, pointing to the survival of consciousness
          after bodily death. He details how he confronted his resistance to
          engaging in the spiritual and parapsychological practices of his
          deceased father, prominent 20th-century psychic Dr. Richard Ireland,
          who counseled celebrities such as Mae West and the Eisenhower family.
          On his journey, he meets with respected mediums who deliver unexpected
          messages from his son, father, and others who have passed and explores
          the healing impact that such messages can have on people who are
          grieving. He shares his interviews with mediums to understand how they
          see, hear, and feel the information they receive from the spirits of
          the deceased, and he explains how to recognize fraudulent mediums.
          <br /><br />Ireland presents detailed accounts of scientific
          experiments conducted to obtain evidence for the continuity of
          consciousness, including the author’s own test involving a secret
          message left behind by his deceased sister, Robin. The contents of
          this message were unknown to any living person and remained sealed in
          an envelope until the author received messages from a group of
          mediums. He exposes deceptive arguments made by skeptics and examines
          mediumship through the lens of multiple religious traditions—including
          some factions who seek to demonize the practice. Showing how spirit
          communication can be undeniably accurate and frustratingly ambiguous,
          Ireland reveals the profound healing and transformative possibilities
          available to those who come to believe in the persistence of the soul.
