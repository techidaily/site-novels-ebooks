            It is possible to access the same sense of well-being, clarity,
            inner freedom, and loving connection realized by the world’s
            meditation masters. We can do this by shifting our awareness in the
            midst of our daily lives. Shift into Freedom presents innovative
            teacher Loch Kelly’s training manual for actively participating in
            the evolution of your own consciousness.<br /><br />Synthesizing
            insights from neuroscience and psychology with wisdom from the
            world’s contemplative traditions, Shift into Freedom offers an
            accessible and remarkably powerful series of meditations that lead
            us to a little-known natural capacity called “awake awareness.”
            Through an unfolding process of “small glimpses, many times,” these
            exercises shift us from a thought-based knowing to an
            awareness-based way of operating in the world. With continued
            practice, we learn to “unhook” from our customary home in our
            ego-based identity—and then sustain an embodied presence and
            relatedness known as “open-hearted awareness.” Loch Kelly teaches
            that this is “the meeting place of awakening and growing up, where
            we have the capacity to handle a fully emotional, intimate life and
            act with authenticity and compassion.”<br /><br />Learn more
            about:<br /><br />• How to separate awareness from thinking to
            realize that thoughts and emotions are not the center of who we
            are<br /><br />• How insights from neuroscience can help us learn
            how to embody awakening<br /><br />• Ego-identification, a pattern
            of thought that co-opts the body’s boundary program and creates a
            mistaken identity<br /><br />• The paradox of “being home while
            returning home”<br /><br />• Finding the off-switch for the
            chattering mind<br /><br />• How to intentionally and immediately
            shift into peace of mind any time of your day<br /><br />• Awakening
            as a natural process of human development, which unfolds as waking
            up, waking in, and waking out<br /><br />• Meditation practices for
            all phases of the journey of awakening and embodiment<br /><br />•
            Four stages of spiritual growth: recognition, realization,
            stabilization, and expression<br /><br />• Untying the “knots” in
            our mindbody system to liberate us from our deepest doubts and
            fears<br /><br />• How to move from deliberate mindfulness to
            effortless mindfulness and heart mindfulness<br /><br />• How to
            effortlessly focus without using attention<br /><br />• Discovering
            your innate happiness that is not dependent on circumstances<br /><br />•
            How to welcome and liberate sub-personalities after initial
            awakening<br /><br />• A user’s manual for your consciousness to
            help you free yourself from the limits of ego-identification and
            live from open-hearted awareness
