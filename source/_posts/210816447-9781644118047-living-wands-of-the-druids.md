            >A practical guide to the creation of natural wands for magical
            work</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains the variety of woods and other botanicals that
          may be used to craft wands, their magical and hermetic attributes and
          virtues, and how these influence the adept’s intention and magical
          workings<br /><br />
          • Offers detailed harvesting advice, explaining the necessary magical
          actions specific to each tree as well as important influences such as
          the phases of the moon and the seasons<br /><br />
          • Offers step-by-step instructions for wand practice, including
          magical workings, cleansing, intention, potentializing, and how to
          properly return a wand to nature<br /><br />
          From Moses to Merlin to the power of the royal scepter, the wand has
          been a key magical device found in nearly every civilization and
          esoteric tradition throughout history. The fundamental purpose of a
          wand is to act as a spiritual conduit, harnessing the power of the
          adept’s intention and channeling it into manifestation.<br /><br />
          Exploring the history, lore, and creation of living wands—those
          crafted from local natural materials—fifth-generation Druid Jon G.
          Hughes presents a practical guide to the harvesting, crafting, and
          potentializing of living wands, as well as rods and staffs. He offers
          detailed harvesting advice, explaining the magical actions and
          meditations specific to each tree that should accompany crafting work
          as well as important influences such as the phases of the moon and the
          seasons. He looks in depth at woodlore, explaining the variety of
          woods and other botanicals that may be used to craft wands, their
          magical and hermetic attributes and virtues, and how these influence
          the adept’s intention and magical workings. Trees and botanicals
          examined include oak, hawthorn, hazel, birch, apple, ash, mistletoe,
          holly, and ivy.<br /><br />
          The author explores various types of wands, such as rood, entwined,
          thorn, and compound, detailing how each differs in its use and
          intended outcome. He offers step-by-step instructions on how to use
          wands for magical workings and explains other aspects of wand
          practice, including cleansing, intention, potentializing, and how to
          properly return a wand to nature after its purpose has been
          fulfilled.<br /><br />
          Presenting a complete guide to crafting and using living wands as well
          as the history and lore behind this traditional form of Druidic
          natural magic, this book allows you to harness the magical essence of
          the living natural resources that surround you, helping you elevate
          your manifestations from the mundane to the higher spiritual planes.
