          “There are dozens of books about the tarot and not all of them tell us
          anything new. Cherry Gilchrist's <i>Tarot Triumphs </i>is among those
          few that open up uncharted areas and throw a revealing light on what
          we may think is all too familiar to us. It is a work of insight,
          passion, and practical engagement that can inform its readers'
          understanding as well as their lives. One doesn't need a fortune
          teller to predict that its future looks promising.” --<b

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Cherry Gilchrist</b> is a writer and lecturer and a long-time
          participant in Western traditions relating to Kabbala, meditation, and
          hermeticism. She is a graduate of Cambridge University, UK, in English
          and Anthropology, and holds a post-graduate diploma from the
          University of Bath Spa in Cultural Astronomy and Astrology. As an
          author, Cherry has published widely on mythology, traditional culture,
          and inner traditions. She writes both for adults and for children, and
          has won a UK Reading Award for her Calendar of Festivals. Her books
          include
          <i
            >The Elements of Alchemy, Stories from the Silk Road, The Circle of
            Nine </i
          >and <i>Divination</i>. Many of her titles have been translated into
          other languages, including Italian, French, German, Spanish and
          Portuguese. With something of the merchant also in her blood, she has
          for many years visited Russia in search of beautiful lacquer
          miniatures and the rich heritage of Russian folk lore and craft,
          making a total of nearly sixty trips to Russia. She ran a Russian arts
          gallery in the city of Bath, England, for a number of years, and has
          put on leading exhibitions of Russian folk art at museums and
          galleries. Cherry is also a well-known lecturer, a popular speaker on
          Russian art and culture and inner traditions. Cherry has visited
          Russia over fifty times, and has researched its traditional lore as
          well as dealing in Russian arts and crafts, and staying on many
          occasions in a wooden village house deep in the Russian countryside.
          During her contacts with artists and villagers, as well as with museum
          experts and ethnographers, she not only discovered much about the
          regional traditions of Russia, but experienced some of them at first
          hand. She visited a shaman in Siberia, took part in the Maslnitsa
          festival in Moscow, and celebrated New Year traditional style, in the
          depths of a frozen forest. Cherry now lives near Stroud, in
          Gloucestershire, with her partner Robert, an artist. She enjoys
          travel, and has visited destinations as far apart as Samarkand, Easter
          Island, and Ethiopia. She also loves music, especially singing early
          music, walking in the countryside, and cookery.
