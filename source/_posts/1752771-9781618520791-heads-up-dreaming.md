            >A scientist shows us that we all have the biological capability to
            reduce uncertainty in our lives…</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Heads-Up Dreaming</i>&nbsp;is a book about Dr. Smith’s
          personal discovery of the ability to have dreams that seem to portray
          future waking events. While other writers have noted this before, what
          makes Smith’s book unique is his thorough overview of the nature and
          characteristics of these kinds of dreams and how they differ from more
          ordinary ones. &nbsp;<br /><br />
          Through his research, he has discovered that people he knows (family,
          friends, and students) can also access “heads-up” dreams, suggesting
          this is a normal biological activity. Although it is an activity that
          appears to defy the rules of classical physics, it does not violate
          the rules of quantum physics. While some folks may be more
          accomplished at it than others – for example, he describes the dreams
          of one very talented individual who uses her dreams to guide her
          medical practice - it is an exercise available to all of us.<br /><br />
          Some of our most important decisions including choosing a life
          partner, buying homes or cars, changing jobs, are often made with
          partial information under considerable stress, using emotional rather
          than logical thinking. With Smith’s process as a guide, you have the
          ability to eliminate some of life’s uncertainty by interpreting your
          heads-up dreams – some or all of them will most likely have a thing or
          two to do with major decisions. In his experience, he’s found these
          unique dreams often arrive in a timely manner and are typically
          neutral or positive. With this in mind, anyone concerned with only
          receiving negative predictions, should rest assured.<br /><br /><i
            >Heads-Up Dreaming</i
          >&nbsp;can teach anyone the basic ability to recognize heads-up dreams
          and to use them as a guide for making some of life’s important
          decisions.
