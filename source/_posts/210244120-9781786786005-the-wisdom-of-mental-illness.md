            >This book explores how the ancient path of shamanism can help us to
            understand the nature of mental illness, recasting psychological
            breakdown as a potentially transformational experience. What we
            label as pathological could actually be an initiation into a better
            relationship with ourselves and the world.</b
          ><br /><br />Written for those who are experiencing or who have
          experienced mental illness, or whose loved ones are going through such
          episodes, or who are mental wellbeing practitioners, this is a guide
          to the potentially transformational experience of that which we label
          mental illness. It explores the ancient concept of the "shamanic
          sickness", whereby the prospective shaman underwent many years of
          mental distress as part of their initiation, and looks at what this
          can teach us about mental health. It argues that, in some cases, what
          we seek to medicate could actually be a calling to a path of service
          and healing.&nbsp;<br />The book also explores our cultural biases
          around mental illness. What we define as pathological, many cultures
          see as a sign of being inspired and in touch with greater powers. It
          looks at our uneasy relationship with altered states of consciousness
          and how these might hold the key to healing many symptoms of mental
          illness. Finally it looks at how we, as species, have come out of
          balance in our relationship to nature and the devastating affect this
          is having on our mental health. By learning from ancient indigenous
          cultures who have remained in balance with the natural world, this
          book looks at solutions to heal this modern imbalance and find a way
          forward for the Earth and ourselves.
