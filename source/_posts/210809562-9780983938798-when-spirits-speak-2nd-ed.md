            Jeri K Tory Conklin's newest novel reveals real life stories of
            soldiers past and present. Their stories from beyond the grave will
            absolutely touch your heart in
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">unimaginable</span> ways. As a
            gifted author and experienced medium, Jeri shares these emotional,
            insightful, and heartwarming messages with the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Praise for these thought-provoking stories of those who paid the
            ultimate cost of
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">freedom,</span> and new stories of
            those who survived challenges, you, the
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">reader, are willing to</span>
            contemplate the sacrifices and limits you are willing to go to
            secure them as well. Is it a calling these heroes were answering for
            their own <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0)">freedom,</span> or is it
            something much larger? What are you willing to sacrifice to retain
            your freedoms?

            "Jeri Tory Conklin - a gifted intuitive, archaeologist, and
            investigative author - again lifts the veil between the visible and
            invisible world, this time to give us an inside perspective on
            veteran experiences during the Vietnam War. An eye-opening
            inspirational book." (2012)
          </p>
          <p>
            The gifted intuitive Jeri K. Tory Conklin has again lent her pen and
            paper to our American servicemen who have lost their lives on the
            battlefield and made the ultimate sacrifice. The powerful soldiers'
            stories that are channeled in this book speak of wisdom, heartfelt
            forgiveness and love, human emotions that are not usually associated
            with war. Their stories often speak of the moments leading up to
            their physical transitions that will truly bring peace and comfort
            to anyone who has lost loved ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jeri also incorporates thought-provoking concepts of service and the
            "Cost of Freedom" insights from people who have served our nation
            and have returned home to share their stories with us.

          This is a no miss book whether you have served in the military or not.
          To quote Jeri "Perhaps the true cost of freedom is in the giving of
          ourselves. It is the giving of ourselves for another to experience
          freedoms from and the journey to whatever it is they are seeking."
        </p>
        <p>
          We are all love and, in my opinion, it is important we all serve those
          we meet along our way.

          Experiencing this journey was like being in a virtual world that took
          you to another dimension. Each spirits' story made me feel as if I was
          actually on the battle scene, vicariously forcing me to read without
          pause. Each clairvoyance, clairsentience and testimonial journey were
          met with sorrow, patriotism, and pride that I am a patriot and
          advocate of this country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Praise for Jeri's writing style along with her gift of channeling
          communications with the spirit world, listening to patriots spanning
          generations as well as, the memories of our living heroes. It is the
          realization of the true Cost of Freedom that brings this body of
          inspirational genius to the forefront of my own literary collection.
