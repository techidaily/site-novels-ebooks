          • Shares detailed accounts from people who have experienced time
          slips, including the author’s own experiences, as well as the
          practices of shamans, yoga masters, and Samadhi mystics who use
          trance-like meditative states to travel outside normal space and time
          <br /><br />• Offers step-by-step exercises to prepare you to
          experience time shifts, to help set them up, and to enhance the
          experience when you have slipped through time <br /><br />• Examines
          criticisms of and scientific support for this phenomenon, debunking
          claims that time slips are delusions or remembrances of past lives and
          showing that they may be related to energy vortices, black holes, or
          astral travel <br /><br />Every now and then somebody reports stepping
          out of normal time and space. It doesn’t seem to matter where they
          live or their background--the veil of ordinary reality drops and they
          suddenly slip into the past or future, usually seamlessly and
          unknowingly, experiencing a temporary and accidental form of time
          travel. <br /><br />Sharing detailed accounts from people who have
          experienced time slips and shifts between realities, including his own
          experiences, Von Braschler examines what their stories have in common
          to establish the pattern behind how these sudden slips in time occur.
          He examines criticisms of and scientific support for this phenomenon,
          debunking claims that time slips are delusions, implanted memories, or
          remembrances of past lives and showing that they may be related to
          energy vortices, tears in the fabric of our reality, black holes,
          astral travel, or light body movements. Studying reliable models from
          both the West and the East, he compares these excursions with shamanic
          journeying and the practices of yoga masters and Samadhi mystics, who
          use trance-like meditative states to travel outside normal space and
          time. Exploring the work of Einstein and other physicists, the author
          also examines the different speed with which time passes in ordinary
          reality and during time shifts--people will find that only a few
          minutes has elapsed for a time-shift experience that appeared to take
          hours. <br /><br />Offering step-by-step exercises to prepare you to
          experience time shifts, to help set them up, and to enhance the
          experience when you have slipped through time, the author provides a
          road map allowing anyone to explore shifts in time and space and
          expand their awareness beyond ordinary reality.
