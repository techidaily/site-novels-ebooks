            ***Featuring contributors such as: John Edward, Char Margolis, Sandy
            Anastasia, Rick Levine, Glynis McCants, Mark Van Stone, Mary Jo
            McCabe, Gahl Sasson, Dr. Alicia Tisdale, Maggie Kerr, Kala Ambrose,
            Mirabai Devi, Linda West, Derek O'Neill, Alan Oken , John Holland
            and Austyn Wells.***<br /><br />For the past forty years there have
            been a growing number of people who believe that nothing less than a
            cataclysmic change is coming in the evolution of Mankind. From the
            dawning of the Age of Aquarius to cosmic forces—read Aliens—coming
            to engineer our DNA, to the doomsday scenarios triggered by the end
            of the Mayan calendar, there have been those who are sure that the
            world as we know it is coming to an end. And soon.<br /><br />But
            that cataclysmic end has not (de)materialized, or has it? In 2012
            new data was discovered in Guatemala that gives us concrete evidence
            of a new paradigm concerning the Mayans and their calendar. We are
            now faced with the idea that perhaps we aren't staring at Armageddon
            but stand in the middle of a 33-year transformative process. While
            the Mayans might have seen a change for humanity it isn't an ending
            per se. <br /><br />And if there <i>is</i> change, why does that
            change need to imply destruction? Couldn't it be an opportunity for
            mankind to assess their place in the universe and engage in a
            positive rebirth in a new era?<br /><br /><i
              >Beyond The Mayan Prophecy </i
            >posits that our modern day weakness or confusion can be attributed
            to a less spiritual way of thinking. Perhaps our left side brain
            thinking has held us back from discovering and accepting higher
            planetary secrets for centuries. To move forward with more balanced
            understanding, Paul Shavelson, a multi-media story teller and former
            Executive Producer of the hit psychic television show CROSSING OVER,
            has spent the last decade exploring the world of psychics and
            mystics. Paul has assembled a "psychic dream team" to decode the
            past and to predict the future. With famed metaphysical experts such
            as Char Margolis, Rick Levine, Maggie Kerr, Alan Oken, and
            Numerologist Glynis McCants, Paul covers everything from alien
            communication to instant collective thinking (The Collective
            Unconscious) being cultivated on the internet. The dialogue and
            interviews will be discussed through sidebars by psychic medium,
            author, and TV personality, John Edward, who also provides the
            forward, and afterword of this provocative subject.<br /><br />With
            positive energy and a willingness to have us think outside the box
            (and a personal journey by the author that brings an unexpected and
            moving aspect to the experience),<i> Beyond The Mayan Prophecy </i
            >is an entertaining, thought provoking work that <i>w</i>ill let the
            reader embrace why the second half of this transition could be
            remarkable and inspiring.<br /><br /><br />At the Publisher's
            request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management
