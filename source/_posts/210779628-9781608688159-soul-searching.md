          RECONNECTING TO THE PUREST VERSION OF OURSELVES<br />
          <br />
          Reclaiming our destiny and moving forward requires finding our higher
          self — the innocent, virtuous, vulnerable child within us. Our spirit
          self is always in contact with that child, who wants us to be more
          imaginative, intuitive, honest, and open to receiving love, no matter
          what indoctrinations and toxic environments we have experienced. In
          Soul Searching, beloved psychic medium Bill Philipps shows how to
          reconnect to that spiritual nature we had as children and why those
          gifts we entered this life with are important. Using beautifully
          written stories and practical suggestions, Bill helps us access and
          build upon our innate skills of intuition, trust, forgiveness, and
          gratitude. He shows that it is not only possible but crucial to:<br />
          <br />
          • hear, feel, and honor our grief without being overwhelmed by it<br />
          • forgive without forgetting<br />
          • embrace and utilize the powers of gratitude, prayer, and setting
          intentions to manifest the life we desire<br />
          • set ourselves and others fully free to live, love, and thrive<br />
