            Psychic artist and medium Jane de Forest draws on the invisible
            world behind our five senses in this entertaining first-hand account
            of people reunited with loved ones and animals in the afterlife. She
            investigates how the connections and bonds shared in earthly
            relationships are unbroken by death in this richly illustrated book
            filled with beautiful art and gentle insights. Based on true
            stories, Love Never Dies is a humbling and magical journey through
            the struggles, mishaps and heartfelt rewards of translating messages
            between different realities. From ancient mysticism to modern New
            Age philosophy, this book is an excellent read for those interested
            in parapsychology and prophecy, reincarnation and spiritual healing,
            as well as a lovely gift for those grieving loss.<br /><br />“Three
            generations of women created this work: my elderly mother did the
            heavy lifting with hours of rewrites, and my 12-year-old art-prodigy
            daughter Tara illustrated half of it. The romantic image of being a
            published author dimmed quickly with heated debates (read: editing
            wars) with my maternal editor about important topics such as commas;
            this process took three years and seemed to have a mind of its own
            -- the stories hounded me into the wee hours of the morning when I
            was without defenses. Once I figured out that writing the stories
            down insured uninterrupted sleep, this book was born. I hope this
            work will make a small difference in a world that has forgotten what
            is important. I am deeply grateful to my clients and family for
            allowing me the opportunity to share their private spiritual
            journeys. Truly, we are all interconnected and entangled . . . love
            is our foundation . . . I am proud an honored to share my heart with
            you.” Jane de Forest&nbsp;<br /><br />For signed and numbered prints
            of the illustrations as well as information about intuitive
            consultation, coaching, workshops, sacred journey travel and Jane’s
            pro- bono work with autistic kids . . . please check out her
            website: Jane’s Inspiration ;-)&nbsp;<br /><br />Ancient wisdom
            &amp; conceptual ideas shared in this book:<br />•Love never dies
            and the sweet bonds of heartfelt relationships exists forever –
            you’ll be united with your animals and people it’s just a matter of
            time.&nbsp;<br />•Psychic animal (horse &amp; dog, look for cats
            &amp; bees in my next book) communication or inter-species ESP --
            extra-sensory perception. The truth is animals know what you are
            thinking.<br />•Spiritual psychology and philosophy -- our temporary
            home on Earth is a type of school, albeit elementary, to learn
            spiritual lessons.<br />•Karma or “golden rule” is real; there is an
            energetic feedback loop.<br />•The future is visible and malleable
            -- you can and do affect it.<br />•Personal growth and
            transformation -- it is easier to resolve conflict and let go of
            resentments while still on Earth.<br />•Mental and spiritual healing
            -- the affect we have on loved ones on the Other Side with your
            thoughts and feelings.<br />•Life-force chi energy can be optimized
            for self-empowerment and how to.<br />•Mediumship, spirit
            communication or your basic “talking to dead people”<br />•Mother
            Nature has equipped us ALL with abilities to intuitively receive
            knowledge; it just takes a little training.<br /><br />In addition
            to writing, coaching and teaching workshops, I also love to garden,
            cook and hike with my family in the beautiful northern rainforest of
            the Pacific Northwest. I am a community volunteer and donate time
            teaching art in schools; I've recently taken up helping save the bee
            in our area . In my pro-bono work, I use ESP to help kids with
            severe disabilities who can't communicate in traditional way.

          "I must tell you that loved every word in "Love Never Dies." I've read
          through a long list of books about intuition and psychics, but never
          one this delightful, engaging, and comforting. Psychic ability is
          confounding and unsettling for many people, but Jane cuts through the
          mumbo-jumbo and replaces it with wonder, joy and hope. Ever- generous,
          she reveals her own doubts along the way, and guides you to a much
          better appreciation for your own profound inner knowing. Her words are
          the words of a true friend, and her art invites you in -- don't let
          this book pass you by. It is looking for a place at your bedside,
          close to your heart."&nbsp;— New York Times Bestselling Author, Susan
          Chernak McElroy "Animals as Teachers and Healers”
        </p>
        <p>
          Lover Never Dies is a deeply moving and touching collection of stories
          of Love transcending our daily experience of life. It gives deep
          comfort to appreciate the interconnection which is present between all
          those who touch our lives beyond our normal comprehension. Jane
          provides a unique insight into her intuitive process which is deeply
          sincere and caring. Her insights open a new appreciation of our common
          connection and existence beyond the five senses and our experience of
          time and space. Heartily recommended to anyone who has loved or been
          loved and lost in any manifestation.-&nbsp;Brett Schafman

          Jane de Forest’s book, “Love Never Dies” is a charming yet deeply
          insightful journey into the “world beyond the veil.” As much as Jane
          has an undeniable and amazing connection with those that have
          transitioned to the spiritual world, she has a delightfully down to
          earth, humorous and heartfelt way of relaying her stories. Jane
          generously shares the great insights and knowledge she has in her
          abilities as a spiritual communicator. She gives us the much needed
          assurance that those we love who have passed on (both human and
          animals) are still with us and are grateful to have the connection to
          be able to communicate that to us. Love Never Dies is a beautifully
          told, never ending love story between us and those we love - who Jane
          shows are still with us – always! -&nbsp;Dianne Leandres

          When I read this book, I tried to expand my understanding of the
          author’s intuitive experiences. Having credible testimonials and
          fascinating illustrations, the way she details what went through her
          mind is quite potent and extraordinary. As the author is a remarkable
          artist, her renderings are evocative and I feel like I am perceiving
          energy flow from the images—intriguing and absorbing. I also enjoyed
          reading about animal intelligence. The author quotes, “Animals are a
          common way spirits communicate with those still alive on Earth.” I do
          agree with her. Reading this book reassures me about unending life and
          how important to be sensitive to all beings. I highly recommend this
          book as the book resonates with me in so many ways. -&nbsp;Kumilko

          Jane de Forest beautifully retells encounters with clients and the
          spirits of their lost loved ones. She was able to give many people
          closure and reconnect them in ways that you never expect after someone
          has died. In addition to lost loved ones, she work with deceased pets,
          relationship troubles, and questions about life's path. I most enjoyed
          that the book was a series of rewritten psychic sessions, instead of a
          general overview of her work. As she works, she sketches things she
          sees with her sixth sense, and the art added nicely to the book's
          appeal. Jane's gift is incredible and I found myself with goosebumps
          as I read things that she wouldn't have known without seeing
          them.&nbsp;-Sequoia Pullella-Barca
