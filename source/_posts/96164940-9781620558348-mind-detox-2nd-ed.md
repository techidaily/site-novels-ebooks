          Heal the hidden cause of your symptoms with the 5-step Mind Detox
          method <br /><br />• Details an effective 5-step technique that
          quickly resolves the root-cause experiences and beliefs that trigger
          chronic conditions and negative behavior patterns <br /><br />•
          Explores the most common unhealthy beliefs that have been found to
          negatively impact health, wealth and happiness, and shows ways to heal
          them <br /><br />• Provides practical healing tools like Blind-Spot
          Busting, Decision Destroyers, and Mind Detox with EFT <br /><br />Do
          you suffer from chronic physical or emotional conditions? Feel stuck
          with reoccurring patterns in your life? Don’t know why you react the
          way you do and can’t seem to help it? Much of our chronic conditions,
          repetitive behaviors, and emotional problems can be traced to
          unresolved past events stuck in the unconscious mind and to unhealthy
          belief systems we developed in our past that are no longer serving us
          in the present. <br /><br />In <i>Mind Detox</i>, Sandy C. Newbigging
          reveals a deceptively simple, yet potent 5-step method for detoxing
          the unconscious mind and resolving physical, emotional, and life
          problems. The author explains how to roll back in time to discover the
          significant emotional event, the root-cause experience, that shaped
          the core beliefs that trigger your chronic condition or behavior
          patterns. He describes how to reflect on why this root-cause event was
          a problem at the time and then consider the experience in light of
          your more-aware, present-day self, allowing you to form new
          conclusions about what happened. Releasing you from your root-cause
          events, the past events no longer negatively impact you today, you
          find peace in the present, and your body becomes more able to heal.
          <br /><br />In addition to the author’s simple 5-step Mind Detox
          system, he offers guidance on how to use EFT in combination with the
          Mind Detox method, explores common major blind spots in our belief
          systems and how to overcome them, and offers practical healing tools
          like the “decision destroyer.” He also explores the most common
          unhealthy beliefs that have been found to negatively impact health,
          wealth, and happiness, showing ways to heal them, and shares
          self-healing success stories of how the Mind Detox method has
          successfully cleared skin conditions, erased chronic pain, and healed
          digestive disorders. <br /><br />Providing a powerful way to let go of
          emotional baggage, release toxic beliefs, and clear the mental blocks
          to your goals, this 5-step guide empowers you to rewrite your past,
          find resolution for negative experiences, and use your newly cleansed
          mind to achieve brilliant success in all areas of life, along with
          happiness, wealth, and well-being.
