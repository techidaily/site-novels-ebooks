              opens with a plane crash and ends with a life-threatening illness.
              At the age of twenty-five, Lori Hodges chose to make a career
              helping people during the worst days of their lives. She has spent
              the last thirty years in emergency services-first as a firefighter
              and paramedic and later as an emergency manager, helping to
              coordinate the response and recovery to disasters. It is through
              this work that she has come to see the beauty in tragedy.</span

              - that we are able to step forward confidently into a new day.

          "Shaking in the Forest is so much more than a career journey-it is a
          courageous look at life lessons from several different perspectives.
          If you like to read about fascinating calls in the responder world, or
          you want to learn the mental and emotional processes that help a
          person grow and survive, or you want to hear about the meaning and
          life lessons we all can learn from experiences, whether they are our
          own or someone else's, this book is for you. I am already planning
          when I will read it a second time so I can again visit lessons on
          courage, hope, learning, fear, compassion, and so much more."<strong

          "The author, a self-described systems thinker and student of chaos
          theory, shares her thoughts on her lifetime of work in emergency
          services. Reading Shaking in the Forest is like starting an internet
          search and creating multiple open tabs-it's all interesting and it's
          all connected in an overarching way to the unifying theme of how
          seeing the worst of life opens our eyes to what is best and
          beautiful."<strong>

          "Lori Hodges immediately captivates readers from the start of Shaking
          in the Forest. She quietly lets the audience into her raw, personal
          stories and reflections, resulting in unpredictable experiences we can
          all learn from. Lori's resilience in every aspect of her life-from
          personal challenges and struggles to her time as a firefighter,
          paramedic, and emergency manager-is not only inspirational but
          gripping and moving, showing her heartfelt passion for helping others.
          She shares the good, the bad, and the chaos. Her 'fight or flee'
          mentality stirs many human emotions and has not stopped Lori from
          looking ahead with a positive attitude. The life lessons spotlighted
          throughout the book are extraordinary."<strong>

          "Lori's personal journey makes a captivating and compelling read. Lori
          opens her guarded heart, pouring her experiences, life's challenges,
          metaphysical learning, and philosophical insights onto every page. She
          provides a transformative journey into the depths of her
          consciousness. Her prose provides humorous yet profound insights that
          guide readers toward a state of inner peace and presence that is both
          liberating and empowering. This story reminds me of Eckart Tolle's The
          Power of Now in its delivery of embracing the present moment fully,
          without judgment or resistance. This is not a story of Lori's work as
          a firefighter, paramedic, and emergency manager, although she weaves
          in experiences of calls and incidents, but a story of trauma,
          perseverance, resilience, and selfactualization at a time of another
          unwelcome affliction. Each page is imbued with the pain and beauty of
          growth, making it not only a memoir but also a guide on how to
          confront one's past and shape one's future. I found Lori's story
          remarkably similar to my own, making it easily relatable. I highly
          recommend it for anyone ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery
          and inner transformation."
