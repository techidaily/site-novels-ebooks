              >From the bestselling author of
              <i>Help, Thanks, Wow</i>&nbsp;comes an inspiring guide to
              restoring hope and joy in our lives.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />In <i>Dusk, Night, Dawn</i>, Anne Lamott explores the
          tough questions that many of us grapple with. How can we recapture the
          confidence we once had as we stumble through the dark times that seem
          increasingly bleak? As bad newspiles up—from climate crises to daily
          assaults on civility—how can we cope? Where, she asks, “do we start to
          get our world and joy and hope and our faith in life itself&nbsp;back
          . . . with our sore feet, hearing loss, stiff fingers, poor digestion,
          stunned minds, broken hearts?”<br /><br />We begin, Lamott says, by
          accepting our flaws and embracing our humanity.<br /><br />Drawing
          from her own experiences, Lamott shows us the intimate and human ways
          we can adopt to move through&nbsp;life’s dark places and toward the
          light of hope that still burns ahead for all of us.<br /><br />As she
          does in <i>Help, Thanks, Wow </i>and her other bestselling books,
          Lamott explores the thorny issues of life and faith by breaking them
          down into manageable, human-sized questions for readers to ponder, in
          the process showing us how we can amplify life's small moments of joy
          by staying open to love and connection. As Lamott notes in
          <i>Dusk, Night, Dawn</i>,&nbsp;“I got Medicare three days before I got
          hitched, which sounds like something an old person might do, which
          does not describe adorably ageless me.” Marrying&nbsp;for the first
          time with a grown son and a grandson, Lamott explains that finding
          happiness with a partner isn't a function of age or beauty but of
          outlook and perspective. <br /><br />Full of the honesty, humor, and
          humanity that have made Lamott beloved by millions of readers,
          <i>Dusk, Night, Dawn</i> is classic&nbsp;Anne Lamott—thoughtful and
          comic, warm and wise—and further proof that Lamott truly speaks to the
          better angels in all of us.

          <i>"Dusk Night Dawn</i> delivers prose that satisfices literary as
          well as spiritual tastes." —<i>The Washington Post<br /><br /></i>"She
          is brilliant. Her writing makes me weep." —Hoda Kotb,
          <i><i>Today Show</i><br /></i><br />"In difficult times, is there a
          more soothing voice than Lamott’s? Her latest book on the trickiness
          of faith and hope is chock-full of her trademark wit, at once
          self-deprecating and self-aggrandizing. And this is her first book
          since getting married in 2019, so those honest insights about choosing
          love amid anxiety are sure to shine even brighter." —<i

          book …<i> </i>will appeal to a wide range of readers who have
          previously enjoyed her relatable writing. Readers new to Lamott are
          opening themselves to a real treat, as her abilities as a storyteller
          are in full form." —<i>Library Journal<br /><br /></i>“In this
          collection of short, incredibly timely essays, Lamott attempts to
          answer the tough questions that many of us grapple with…Drawing from
