              >The Instant <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller!<br /><br />Was an
              advanced civilization lost to history in the global cataclysm that
              ended the last Ice Age? Graham Hancock, the internationally
              bestselling author, has made it his life's work to find out--and
              in <i>America Before</i>, he draws on the latest archaeological
              and DNA evidence to bring his quest to a stunning conclusion.</b
            ><br /><br />We’ve been taught that North and South America were
            empty of humans until around 13,000 years ago – amongst the last
            great landmasses on earth to have been settled by our ancestors. But
            new discoveries have radically reshaped this long-established
            picture and we know now that the Americas were first peopled more
            than 130,000 years ago – many tens of thousands of years before
            human settlements became established elsewhere.<br /><br />Hancock's
            research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the
            scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs.
            In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon
            rainforest, he reveals that ancient "New World" cultures share a
            legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual
            beliefs with supposedly unconnected "Old World" cultures. Have
            archaeologists focused for too long only on the "Old World" in their
            search for the origins of civilization while failing to consider the
            revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found
            in the "New World"?<br /><br /><i
              >America Before: The Key to Earth's Lost</i
            >
            <i>Civilization</i> is the culmination of everything that millions
            of readers have loved in Hancock's body of work over the past
            decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mysteries of the
            past, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications
            for how we lead our lives today.

          "A treasure." —Joe Rogan on Graham Hancock <br /><br />"A fascinating,
          alternative version of prehistory. America Before, detailed and
          wide-ranging, turns what was myth and legend into a new story of the
          past." —<i>Daily Mail</i
          ><b><br /><br />Praise for Graham Hancock's previous books:<br /></b
          ><br />“Hancock’s passionate, detailed prose transports us around the
          globe and across millennia in an accessible and direct manner.” —<i
            >New Dawn Magazine</i
          ><br /><br />“Ingenious.” —<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br /><br />“I’m
          deeply immersed still in Hancock’s “Magicians of the Gods.” I do so
          recommend this book. Hancock is an enchanting writer, and such a
          curious and thoughtful and intuitive investigator of the mysteries of
          lost civilizations and archaeological mysteries.” —Anne Rice,
          <i>NYT</i> bestselling author of <i>The Vampire Chronicles</i>
          <br /><br />"Hancock does a magnificent job of proving beyond
          reasonable doubt that an advanced civilization, which flourished
          during the Ice Age, was destroyed in global cataclysms between 12,800
          and 11,600 years ago." —Atlantis Rising on <i>Magicians of the Gods</i
          ><br /><br />“A reading experience of pure gold...History buffs, Bible
          scholars, anyone who likes a great intellectual detective yarn will
          plunge into The Sign and the Seal and not come up for air until the
          end.” —<i>Seattle Times on The Sign and the Seal</i
          ><br /><br />“Intriguing and entertaining and sturdy enough to give a
          long pause for thought.” —<i
            >Kirkus Reviews on Fingerprints of the Gods</i
          ><br /><br />"Readers will hugely enjoy their quest in these pages of
          inspired storytelling."-<i>The Times of London</i>
