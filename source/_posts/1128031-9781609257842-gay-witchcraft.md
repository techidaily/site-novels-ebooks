          When Christopher Penczak was introduced to Witchcraft, he found a
          spiritual path that honored and embraced his homosexuality. Now he has
          written a book of clearheaded theory and practice that is bound to
          become a classic. With <i>Gay Witchcraft</i>, Penczak joins the ranks
          of his forebearers in spirit, gay writers who have taken a tradition
          and made it home.<br /><br />
          This is a complete book of theory and spiritual practices of
          Witchcraft for the gay community. Penczak's writing will make it much
          easier for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people interested
          in practicing any form of Witchcraft. Exploring the history of
          Paganism and offering a compendium of spells, meditations, ceremonies,
          and affirmations that will enrich both the novice and the experienced
          practioner seeking out new views of myth, ritual, and healing.
