            >This occult classic reveals the supernatural roots of Nazism and
            the power Hitler gained access to by acquiring a legendary holy
            relic.</b
          ><br /><br />Get the astounding history behind the Spear of Longinus
          mentioned in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny!<br /><br />Ever
          since it pierced the side of Christ more than 2,000 years ago, it has
          been said that the Spear of Destiny has been invested with amazing
          occult powers. In this book, Trevor Ravenscroft records its legend and
          involvement in the decline of the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages, and the
          twentieth century. He tells the story of the chain of men who
          possessed the Spear, from Herod the Great to Adolf Hitler, and how
          they sought to change the face of history by wielding its powers for
          good or evil.<br /><br />The Spear of Destiny is identified as the
          Spear of the Holy Grail mentioned in the sagas of the Dark Ages. It is
          believed the holder of the Spear possesses the power of mind
          expansionâ€”as applicable today as it was at the courts of King Arthur
          and Charlemagne. The final chapters of this book describe a Manichean
          battle of the worlds behind the changing scene of the twentieth
          century. For the first time, the Satanic occult development and
          faculties of Adolf Hitler are described in authentic and documented
          detail, showing how he furthered his aims and his conquest of the
          world by black magic.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Trevor Ravenscroft was born in England in 1921. He was educated at
          Repton School, then Sandhurst Military College, before serving as a
          commando officer in World War II. He was captured in a failed attempt
          to assassinate Field Marshal Rommel in North Africa and was a POW in
          Germany from 1941 to 1945, escaping three times but recaptured each
          time. After the war he studied medicine at St. Thomas's Hospital, and
          later became a journalist. He studied history under Dr. Walter
          Johannes Stein for twelve years, carrying out extensive research
          for&nbsp;The Spear of Destiny.&nbsp;Ravenscroft also lectured on
          history in London and Edinburgh and wrote&nbsp;The Mark of the
          Beast&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Cup of Destiny. He died in 1989.
