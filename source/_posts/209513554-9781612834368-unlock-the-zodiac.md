            Some people believe they are absolutely typical of their sun sign,
            while others see little of themselves in the descriptions given in
            most astrology books.
          </p>
          <p>
            Written for beginners as well as astrology students, this
            informative volume explains why one sun sign can include many
            different personalities. There are many possible astrological
            reasons for the diversification within each sign, but this book
            demonstrates two main factors that are easy for a complete beginner
            in astrology to understand and to use: decans and dwads. The system
            presented here is simple and effective and does not require learning
            the complexities of chart interpretation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each sign of the zodiac can be divided into three sections called
            decans, and each decan can be divided into four dwads. These
            divisions can lead to many variations in personalities of people
            born under a specific sign, including those between twins. Determine
            your decan and dwad on the easy-to-use tables provided, then see
            what their interpretations say about your life. Find out how to
            progress your sun sign to check out trends and events for any year
            of your life. After you've evaluated yourself, you can enjoy doing
            the same for your family and friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although perfect for beginners, the simplicity of this approach
            makes it a handy tool for working astrologers and includes
            information on gender, elements, and qualities and how they relate
            to the sun sign.
