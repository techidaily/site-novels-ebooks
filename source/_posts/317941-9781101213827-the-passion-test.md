            >The inspirational and life-changing
            <i>New York Times</i> bestseller that will help you discover the
            meaning behind your life. </b
          ><br /><br />Can a simple test change a person’s life? Through their
          <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>The Passion Test</i>, Janet Bray
          Attwood and Chris Attwood have inspired thousands to shape their lives
          by discovering their passions and living according to what matters
          most to them. Readers can identify their top five passions by taking
          the Test, and then learn exactly how to align their lives with their
          priorities by following the Attwoods’ easy-to-follow step-by-step
          program of action.<br /><br />
          Combining powerful storytelling and profound wisdom from models of
          passionate living such as Jack Canfield, Richard Paul Evans, and
          Stephen M.R. Covey, as well as drawing on their own personal
          experiences, the Attwoods show how living a full and impassioned life
          is not only possible, it’s inevitable—for anyone willing to take the
          Test.

          started on knowing what you want-by getting clear on who you are.”—<b

          “It's simple, it's easy, and it's profound.”—<b>Jack Canfield</b>, #1
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling co-creator of
          <i>Chicken Soup for the Soul</i>&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “[A] clear, simple, and effective method to help you identify your
          core passions so you can create the fulfilling life you deserve.”—<b

          “Co-founders of the online magazine Healthy Wealthy 'n' Wise, husband
          and wife team Bray and Attwood have produced a self-help guide with a
          simple test at its core, requiring readers to list and prioritize
          their goals, wants and desires, weeding and striking until they have
          just five ‘passions’ listed; those are then held against one's life to
          determine how close one is to each (readers are encouraged to retake
          the test every six months). A full life steeped in passion is
          achievable, the authors assert, through the application of three
          concepts: intention, attention and "no tension." In part one, these
          concepts are explored in depth, along with seven steps for "Living
          Life Aligned with Passion"; part two puts these ideas into action.
          Throughout, the text is peppered with anecdotes, theories and analysis
          from experts and colleagues who have taken the test and put it to use
          in their lives… both practical and intuitive.”—<b
