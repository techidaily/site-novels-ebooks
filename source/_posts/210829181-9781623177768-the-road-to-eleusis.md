            >Unlock the secrets of the Eleusinian Mysteries: A deep exploration
            of secret rites, psychedelic sacraments, and spiritual revelations
            that captivated ancient Greek society for nearly two millennia.</b
          ><br /><br />Uncover the evocative history of
          <i><b>The Road to Eleusis</b></i
          >. Once held in hushed whispers, the Eleusinian Mysteries were a
          series of secret rituals and initiations in honor of the goddesses
          Demeter and Persephone. They stood as an enigmatic cornerstone of
          ancient Greek spirituality, capturing imaginations and fevered
          intrigue for close to two millennia. But beneath the veils of
          tradition and ceremony lay a potent secret.<br /><br />First unveiled
          in this book's controversial 1978 release, a groundbreaking trio—a
          mycologist, chemist, and historian—proposed a radical theory: the
          sacred potion imbibed during these clandestine rites was infused with
          a potent, psychoactive entheogen. This was not just a challenge to
          conventional interpretations: it was a revolutionary reframe of the
          role that naturally occurring psychedelic drugs have played in
          spiritual rituals and rites since time immemorial.<br /><br /><i
            ><b>The Road to Eleusis</b></i
          >
          goes beyond dissecting ancient rites: it charts how the authors
          reshaped our modern understanding of entheogens' role in spiritual
          ceremony, revealing facets of the Mysteries previously thought lost to
          history. The authors share intriguing new insights on experiential
          religious practices, perspectives on the healing potential of
          psychedelics, and how—and why—the secrets of the Mysteries were
          deliberately concealed. The book's revelations reach beyond the
          scholarly into legal, social, and spiritual realms—all while recasting
          everything we thought we knew about the rites and rituals of Hellenic
          cults and expanding our understanding of foundational tenets of
          Western philosophical and spiritual thought.<br /><br />This
          30th-anniversary edition brings with it an enlightening preface by
          religious luminary Huston Smith and a renewed exploration of the
          chemical findings by Peter Webster. It powerfully argues for a
          reimagining of Western religious history and the transformative magic
          of entheogens.

          “[Gordon Wasson has] made the specialty of mycology something of
          universal importance and one of the pillars of anthropology and the
          history of religions.” <br />
          —Octavio Paz, Nobel Prize-winning poet and author<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>The Road to Eleusis</i> grew out of a three-way collaboration of
          scholar-scientists sparked by R. Gordon Wasson’s insight into the true
          nature of an ancient religious ritual, the Eleusinian Mysteries. In
          collaboration with the world-renowned chemist, Albert Hofmann, and
          Carl Ruck, a Classical scholar specializing in the ethnobotany of
          ancient Greece, they give solid foundation to what Wasson deduced as
          the essence of the Mysteries. The three authors present their findings
          and their evidence, drawing the specialties of their three fields
          together in fascinatingly persuasive form.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The content of those Mysteries is, together with the identity of
          India’s sacred soma plant, one of the two best kept secrets in
          history, and this book is the most successful attempt I know to unlock
          it. Triangulating the resources of an eminent Classics scholar, the
          most creative mycologist of our time, and the discoverer of LSD, [<i
            >The Road to Eleusis</i
          >] is a historical <i>tour de force</i> while being more than that.
          For by direct implication it raises contemporary questions which our
          cultural establishment has thus far deemed too hot to face.” <br />
          —Huston Smith, author of <i>The World’s Religions</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The book’s themes of the universality of experiential religion, the
          suppression of that knowledge by exploitative forces, and the use of
          psychedelics to reconcile the human and natural worlds make it a
          fascinating and timely read.” <br />

          1943, recently celebrated his 100th birthday in Switzerland. Carl A.
