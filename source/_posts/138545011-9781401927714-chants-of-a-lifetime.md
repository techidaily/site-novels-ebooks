            you practice the ancient art of chanting.</b
          ><br /><br /><i>Chants of a Lifetime</i> offers an intimate collection
          of stories, teachings, and insights from <b>Krishna Das</b>, who has
          been called "the chant master of American yoga" by the
          <i>New York Times</i>. Since 1994, the sound of his voice singing
          traditional Indian chants with a Western flavor has brought the
          spiritual experience of chanting to audiences all over the world. He
          has previously shared some of his spiritual journey through talks and
          workshops, but now he offers a unique book-with-audio download
          combination that explores his fascinating path and creates an
          opportunity for just about anyone to experience chanting in a unique
          and special way.<br /><br /><i>Chants of a Lifetime</i> includes
          photos from Krishna Das’s years in India and also from his life as a
          kirtan leader—and the audio that is offered exclusively in the book
          consists of a number of "private" chanting sessions with the author.
          Instead of just being performances of chants for listening, the
          recordings make it seem as if Krishna Das himself is present for a
          one-on-one chanting session. The idea is for the listener to explore
          his or her own practice of chanting and develop a deepening connection
          with the entire chanting experience.

          “Krishna Das offers a gift of love—this candid, lively, and helpful
          guide to the path that opens the heart. <i>Chants of a Lifetime</i> is
          an instant spiritual classic.”<br />— <b>Daniel Goleman</b>, the
          author of <i>Emotional Intelligence</i><br /><br />“In Chants of a
          Lifetime, Krishna Das opens a door to a world of boundless love. This
          is a book about a real and transformational path—including all of
          life’s challenges, inspiration, and uncertainty. It serves as an
          invitation to unwavering happiness.”<br />— <b>Sharon Salzberg</b>,
          the author of
          <i>Lovingkindness:The Revolutionary Art of Happiness<br /><br /></i
          >“Knowing the sweet power and depth of Krishna Das’s singing, I was
          delighted to see, in this honest testament, how he got there. This
          book shows how Kirtan (singing the names of God) enters into our
          spiritual heart and then lights it up.”<br />— <b>Ram Dass</b>, the
          author of <i>Be Here Now<br /><br /></i>“Like a night of ecstatic
          chanting, this book throws open the doors of the heart. Krishna Das
          writes like he sings: with earthy, quirky, luminous clarity.
          <i>Chants of a Lifetime</i> is a reminder that simply uttering any of
          the many names of the Beloved has the power to free us from ourselves,
          and make of our hearts an offering to the One. May we never again
          forget. May we never stop singing.”<br />— <b>Mirabai Starr</b>, the
          author of new translations of John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila

        </h4>
        <p>
          In the winter of 1968, Krishna Das met spiritual seeker Ram Dass and
          was enthralled by the stories of his recent trip to India, where he
          met the legendary guru Neem Karoli Baba. Soon thereafter, he left
          behind his dreams of being a rock ’n’ roll star and was on his way to
          India to meet this remarkable Being. In the three years he spent there
          with Neem Karoli Baba, Krishna Das’s heart was drawn to the practice
          of Bhakti Yoga—the yoga of devotion—and especially to the practice of
          kirtan (chanting the Divine Names).Krishna Das returned to the United
          States and, as he continued chanting, developed his signature style,
          fusing traditional kirtan structure with Western harmonic and rhythmic
          sensibilities. He travels the world, leading call-and-response kirtans
          and sharing this deep, experiential practice with thousands of people.
