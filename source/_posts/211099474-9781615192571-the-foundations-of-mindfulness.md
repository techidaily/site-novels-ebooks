          An Essential Addition to Mindfulness LiteratureWho among us does not
          want to discern right from wrong and useful from useless in any
          situation? Thirty years ago—long before the modern mindfulness
          movement—Eric Harrison began teaching meditation as a secular,
          science-based therapy. Paradoxically, he rooted his practice in the
          Buddha’s original teaching: the Satipatthana Sutta. The 13 steps in
          the Sutta offer readers the full benefits of mindfulness: attention,
          good judgment, and tranquility. Now—informed by a lifetime spent
          teaching tens of thousands to meditate—Harrison offers both a new
          translation of the Sutta (the first in modern English) and lucid
          guidance on how to apply it today.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Eric Harrison was born in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1949. He
          graduated from Victoria University with a BA in English literature and
          music, and started his working life as a schoolteacher and journalist.
          Between 1974 and 1985 he spent a total of 18 months doing retreats in
          the Burmese, Tibetan, Zen, and yoga traditions. While he appreciated
          the opportunities to do long retreats, he found he had no appetite for
          Buddhism itself. When Eric opened the Perth Meditation Centre in 1987,
          he chose to use secular, rational, and science-based language to
          explain meditation. He later supplemented his knowledge with five
          years’ study in biology, cognitive science, and Western philosophy.
          This approach made his work acceptable to the many doctors and
          psychologists who referred clients to him, and to corporations that
          have employed him since. He has now taught 30,000 people how to
          meditate, and his previous six books, including Teach Yourself to
          Meditate and The 5-Minute Meditator, have been translated into 14
          languages.
