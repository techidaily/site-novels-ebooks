            >A collection of quotes and sayings from the oral teachings of a
            leading thinker, writer and teacher of Indigenous spirituality.</b
          ><br /><br />Martín&nbsp;Prechtel is widely recognized as a profound
          and beloved teacher for our times. Raised in the Tzutujil Maya
          shamanic tradition, he has dedicated his life to the preservation and
          promulgation of indigenous spirituality. <i>Rescuing the Light</i> is
          a collection of Prechtel's quotes and sayings spanning the course of
          fifteen years, and recorded at Bolad's Kitchen, a four-year course in
          New Mexico where students from all walks of life gather to receive
          hands-on training in language, history, cooking, farming, and crafts.
          An artist, musician, and storyteller, Prechtel teaches and initiates
          with passion and eloquence, awakening his students to the sacred
          realities present everywhere and at all times. The quotes of wisdom
          and inspiration collected in these pages are earth-centric and
          animist. Divided into thematic sections, they range from the poetic
          and witty to the serious and direct. Sharing his deep shamanic wisdom
          within a grand overview of human history, Prechtel shows us how we can
          reconnect with the unique and unsuspected manifestations of our own
          sacred selves.

          “This is a very powerful soul-growth book, one of the most powerful in
          recent years. The ideas here for renewal and reorganizing are so fresh
          and new that they quicken the taste buds and put an expectant
          readiness in the legs!”&nbsp;<br />—COLEMAN BARKS, author of
          <i>The Essential Rumi</i><br /><br />“In a time of immense cultural
          insanity, Martín’s inimitable spirit echoes out through the words on
          these pages. As an Indigenous woman, his words have had a profound
          healing impact on the generations in my bloodlines. Rescuing the Light
          will reverberate across the grand loom of time, a true gift for the
          transformative times we find ourselves in. This book helps us remember
          how to be good future ancestors and responsible descendants. <br /><i

          eloquence that came before me bloomed off the page with such riotous
          exuberance that it couldn’t be contained, and how do you turn the page
          from that? It’s like looking out the window to see a dragon eating
          your car and turning to finish the dishes.… This is truly a miraculous
          text, like a hatful of magical castles and horses! Please be warned:
          This is not a book of wise sayings designed to make you feel better,
          to make your life better, or feed your soul. It’s really not even a
          book at all—it’s more like a bag of holes to throw onto the wall of
          the box you have been trained to think was your life, and if you dare
          let the light in, and maybe even summon up the courage to peek out,
          you may just find a path to becoming a useful being, capable of
          feeding something far grander than yourself.…” <br />—CHRIS ROBERTSON,
          cinematographer and president of the Fairgrounds Neighborhood
          Association in New Orleans <br /><br />“Through savoring and digesting
          so many sparks of wisdom, perhaps you will discover that
          <i>Rescuing the Light</i> is in essence about beauty—that is, about
          the light that resides inside all things and all people, visible to
          those who dare to look. <br /><i

            trata en esencia sobre la belleza, sobre la luz que reside dentro de
            todos y todo, visible para quienes se atreven a mirar.</i
          >” <br />—IÑAKI ZABALA, international EU worker and Basque thinker
          <br /><br />“After reading <i>Rescuing the Light</i>, I feel like I’ve
          been planted at this moment with spiritual common sense and that I
          don’t have to solve the mystery but know the acceptance of amazement.”

        </h4>
        <p>
          A master of eloquence and innovative language, MARTÍN PPRECHTEL is a
          writer, artist, and teacher who, through his work both written and
          spoken, hopes to promote the subtlety, irony, and premodern vitality
          hidden in any living language. A half-blood Native American with a
          Pueblo Indian upbringing, he left New Mexico to live in the village of
          Santiago Atitlán, Guatemala, eventually becoming a full member of the
          Tzutujil Mayan community there. For many years he served as a
          principal in that body of village leaders responsible for instructing
          the young people in the meanings of their ancient stories through the
          rituals of adult rites of passage. Once again residing in his native
          New Mexico, Prechtel teaches at his international school, Bolad's
          Kitchen. Through music, ritual, farming, sacred architecture, ancient
          textiles, tools, and story, Prechtel helps people in many lands to
          remember their own sense of place in the daily sacred through the
          search for the Indigenous Soul.
