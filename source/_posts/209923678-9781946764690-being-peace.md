          ><br />
          <b></b><br />
          <b>Now updated with a foreword from Dr. Jane Goodall!</b><br />
          <b></b><br />
          One of Thich Nhat Hanh’s first books published in the United States,
          <i>Being Peace </i>was intended for peace activists and as a
          commentary on the peace movement of the time. Now translated into more
          than 30 languages and with half a million copies sold, it has since
          become an indispensable guide for anyone concerned about the state of
          the world and the quality of our lives. Thay’s message of “being peace
          in order to make more peace” is more relevant than ever. <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>Being Peace</i> contains Thich Nhat Hanh’s key practices and is
          filled with practical suggestions for how to create a more peaceful
          world “right in the moment we are alive.” Many of the hallmarks of
          Thich Nhat Hanh appear here for the first time, in his trademark clear
          and steady style.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Now featuring a foreword from Dr. Jane Goodall, this beautiful, newly
          revised edition is the perfect starting point for those who are
          getting their first introduction to Buddhism as well as a must-have
          for those already engaged in the tradition.

          “The monk who taught the world mindfulness.” <br /><b>—<i>TIME</i></b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh shows us the connection between
          personal inner peace and peace on earth.”<br /><b
            >—His Holiness the Dalai Lama</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh is a holy man, for he is humble
          and devout. He is a scholar of immense intellectual capacity. His
          ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to
          world brotherhood, to humanity.”<br /><b
            >—Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh’s work, on and off the page, has
          proven to be the antidote to our modern pain and sorrows. Here is a
          monumental, life-giving mind, preserved as textual force. And that's
          what I feel reading and practicing his teachings: that I am being
          acted on by a compassion equal to and pervasive as gravity
          itself.&nbsp;His books help me be more human,
          more&nbsp;<i>me</i>&nbsp;than I was before.”<br /><b
            >—Ocean Vuong, author of <i>On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</i></b
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“A glass of water in the desert for those
          interested in both Buddhism and the world.”<br /><b
            >—<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“Thich Nhat Hanh is a great teacher. I have
          studied him, his work, his passage through life, with gratitude and
          joy. Through his writings, his public offerings, his insights, I’ve
          gained vision and clarity; I’ve often felt it would be impossible to
          find a more lucid, determined, and courageous soul.”<br /><b
            >—Alice Walker, author of <i>The Color Purple</i></b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“For spiritual seekers and social activists, this
          is it, the bible of Engaged Buddhism.”<br /><b
            >—<i>Inquiring Mind</i></b
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“<i>Being Peace </i>is one of the most
          important books ever written.”<br />­<b
            >—<i>Pilgrim’s Way Catalog</i></b
          ><br /><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“Thich Nhat Hanh does not merely teach
          peace; Thich Nhat Hanh <i>is</i> peace.”<br /><b
            >—Elizabeth Gilbert, author of <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i></b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Thich Nhat Hanh is among the most revered leaders
          in the world. His teachings and mindfulness practices have deeply
          influenced my journey through life. He is a torch of wisdom lighting
          the path ahead, generating the compassion, love, and understanding we
          need to create peace for ourselves and the world.”<br /><b
            >—Marc Benioff, chair and CEO, Salesforce<br /></b
          ><i>&nbsp;</i><br />“Thich Nhat Hanh's words are like water. Simple,
          pure, transparent, and absolutely indispensable for life.”<br /><b
            >—Alejandro Iñárritu, director of <i>Birdman</i> and
            <i>The Revenant</i><br /></b
          >&nbsp;<br />“This book is a treasure. If you look deeply, you will
          see in it the seeds of all of Thich Nhat Hanh’s most important
          teachings, and the seeds of your own awakening as well.”<br /><b
            >—Jack Kornfield, author of <i>A Path With Heart</i><br /></b
          >&nbsp;<br />“How is it that a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who teaches
          mindfulness could inspire Martin Luther King and become one of the
          great nonviolent activists of the twenty-first&nbsp;century? Like no
          other teacher,&nbsp;Thich Nhat Hanh&nbsp;shows us the revolutionary
          possibilities of building social movements based on compassion, for
          both ourselves and others.”<br /><b
            >—Professor john a powell, director of the Othering &amp; Belonging
            Institute at UC&nbsp;Berkeley<br /></b
          >&nbsp;<br />“I first met Thich Nhat Hanh in 1968 in Paris. That was
          the time of rising counter culture, protest against the Vietnam war
          and student uprising. At that time his presence in Paris was like a
          soothing rain in dry heat. Ever since, for more than fifty years, he
          has been the conscience of humanity. He has been a compassionate
          catalyst of spiritual awakening, social harmony and ecological
          awareness. He has nurtured the human spirit with dedication,
          determination and delight. He is humble and gentle yet powerfully
          persuasive and strong willed. It has been a joy of my life to know him
          and follow his teachings.”<br /><b
            >—Satish Kumar, editor emeritus of
            <i>Resurgence &amp; Ecologist </i>magazine and founder of Schumacher
            College<br /></b
          >&nbsp;<br />“It is as though Thich Nhat Hanh has pared down the
          voluminous teachings of Buddhism to their innermost core....This book
          reflects the heart of a remarkable human being, one who has emerged
          from Vietnam’s nightmare with his soul not only intact but
          radiant.”<br /><b>—<i>Resurgence</i><br /></b>&nbsp;<br />“<i
            >Being Peace</i
          >
          is a jewel of love and wisdom, a mirror reflecting our own happy
          Buddhahood... a recognition that will inspire everyone, regardless of
          previous religious persuasion, with the unexpected joy of smiling.”<br /><b
            >—<i>East West Journal</i><br /></b
          >&nbsp;<br />“An exquisite meditation on being peace in order to make
          peace. A book for everyone concerned about the state of the world and
          the quality of our lives.”<br /><b>—<i>In Context</i><br /></b>
