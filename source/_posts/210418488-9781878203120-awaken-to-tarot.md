            The Tarot Cards are magical helpers that can serve you on the
            spiritual journey as they reveal both our True Nature and the
            obstacles to living from this Unified State. These tools for the
            inner journey offer a step-by-step process to awakening. Here is a
            new Tarot deck, made with digital collage. Through pictures,
            symbols, meanings, questions, processes, key words, and
            affirmations, you can learn to:
          </p>
          Explore the magical journey of evolution; Find ways to reflect your
          inner guidance an become your own inner psychic. Discover the power
          and implications of the Tarot symbols. Learn tips on finding your Soul
          purpose, what inner teachers you have each year, sample readings.
          <p>
            Visualizing or working with the images brings the qualities more
            into manifestation. These archetypes or universal principles can
            become inner allies that serve your journey and inform you moment by
            moment. The Tarot symbols are amazingly insightful pictorial
            mythologies that have come down through history as unbound books
            with seventy-eight cards. With then our inner and outer human
            experiences operate symbolically, visually, and non linearly to
            reach us in the same states as our dreams and meditations.The
            mystery of how this works is explained by synchronicity,which is a
            concept that was verbalized by Carl G. Jung in1960. It is a
            meaningful coincidence or a psychic orderliness that transcends time
            and space and activates the archetypes,but that is not determined or
            caused. The unconscious mind becomes stronger than the conscious
            mind and reveals the underlying message.Cosmic symbols are powerful
            with multiple meanings. The general structure of the Tarot
            collectively links our being with destiny and time.

            The universal language is made of twenty-two Trump cards called
            Major Arcana, which represent the universal principles of life. They
            fit perfectly with Astrology and the ten planets and twelve zodiac
            signs. The Minor Arcana consist of fifty-six cards. There are four
            suits with ten cards that signify our opportunities, gifts, and
            challenges, plus four Royalty Cards, which denote teachers or
            masters.
          </p>
          The Swords cover the element Air and are the mental realm and lessons.
          In regular playing cards, they are the spades.The Cups deal with the
          element Water, which are our emotional trials and gifts; they are the
          hearts. The Wands name the Fire element and cover the perceptional and
          spiritual journey, and alternately are called the clubs, batons, and
          slaves. The Disks signify the Earth element and discuss the physical
          and practical concerns. They are the diamonds, and later called coins,
          rings, and pentacles.
          <p>
            All these potencies, adepts, and steps can help you discover your
            own inner knowing, so you can find your own answers.When you allow
            the Tarot cards to guide your growth, it is like having your own
            personal psychic on hand. It is important to have a quiet respectful
            objective when you consult this magical oracle. The process of
            shuffling the cards is a ritual in which you are invoking a
            communication with your own inner guidance.
