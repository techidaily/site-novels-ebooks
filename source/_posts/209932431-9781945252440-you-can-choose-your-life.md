              >Can you really choose your life?<br />When NG Abramson was a
              teenager he made some pretty bad choices. One night when he was
              stopped by the police while driving a stolen car, he panicked and
              stepped on the gas. It was a crazy thing to do, but he chose to do
              it. The result was a tragic accident.</strong

          <p>
            <strong
              >If you've ever made choices that you've regretted, or find
              yourself living a life that's less than satisfying then this book
              offers you hope and a pathway to more peace, freedom and
              happiness.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p><strong>This book is for you if...</strong></p>
          <strong
            >You feel like you are still paying for mistakes from the
            past</strong
          ><strong>You know you're not living up to your full potential</strong
          ><strong>You feel stuck in your job, relationship, or both</strong
          ><strong>You are or have been in AA or other support groups</strong
          ><strong
            >You got into some trouble and are ready to make a new start</strong
          >
          <p>
            <strong
              >Abramson shares his personal story to illustrate the impact our
              choices have on our lives. But this is not a memoir. You Can
              Choose Your Life is about the importance of recognizing our
              "internal conversations," because it's our internal conversations
              that lead to the choices we make. And those choices shape our
              lives.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >The good news is that everyone can make new choices, no matter
              what has happened in the past. When we recognize why we made the
              choices we did, we don't have to repeat the same old
              patterns.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p><strong>What is choosing your life?</strong></p>
          <strong
            >It is an active process that requires you to be as aware,
            conscious, and responsible for the things you tell yourself and
            believe as you can possibly be.</strong
          ><strong
            >Once you're aware, conscious, and responsible for the things you
            tell yourself and believe, you don't have to continue telling
            yourself those same old things.</strong
          >​​​​​​​<strong
            >You can choose the internal conversations you are now going to
            listen to. And by doing so, you are able to make new choices and
            choose your experience of life.</strong
          >
          <p>
            <strong
              >Looking back, the author notes that he did things that were
              against the law because he was listening to conversations in his
              head that had him believe he had to prove his self-worth to others
              to be accepted by them. The real problem, however, was that he
              didn't accept himself. He didn't know that until he began looking
              at his internal conversations.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >This book shows you how to "own" your past, so you don't repeat
              it, especially if there are things about it you don't like. You'll
              become aware of the importance of choosing your life experience,
              no matter what is happening or has happened.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Abramson passionately believes that all people can move beyond
              feeling stuck and live lives they love. Of course, people have to
              be willing to do the work to get themselves unstuck. You Can
              Choose Your Life lays out the kind of work that is and how to do
              it.</strong

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong
              >While we can't take back choices we've already made, we can stop
              making choices that are not moving us closer to living the life of
              our dreams. All it takes is becoming responsible for past choices
              in a way most people are not.</strong

          <p>
            <strong
              >The author doesn't say this is easy to do, but he knows it's
              possible to do, especially if one reads the book and does the
              exercises in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong

              can choose your life and love the life you choose.</strong
