          A 12 WEEK JOURNEY TO PEACE OF MIND Will help anyone who experiences
          any of the following: Stress at home or in the workplace General
          Anxiety State or Anxiety Disorders such as OCD and Phobias Panic
          Attacks Depression, Low Mood or Melancholia Low Confidence and
          Self-Esteem If you have reached Breakdown or Burnout, this unique and
          life changing book will be invaluable to you. Whilst working in a
          mental health setting for 30 years Mary Heath soon discovered that
          everyone she encountered shared a similar problem: no one appeared to
          have any knowledge at all of how to cope with the stress of life and
          its consequences. The great majority of patients had no coping skills
          or strategies at all. No one had been taught how to deal with stress,
          and many didn’t even know what stress was and why they felt so
          helpless, so alone and so afraid. Mary on the other hand had a very
          large tool box and a set of skills that helped all of them to change
          their lives around and become healthier and stronger in every way.
          Having been trained in many disciplines in the field of stress,
          anxiety, depression and personal development she was able to tailor an
          individual’s requirements, according to their specific needs. Working
          with a wide-ranging and extensive variety of therapies Mary taught
          people not just how to cope but how to really live again. Many of the
          techniques and therapies Mary used can be found in this book and
          include: The Simple Principles of the Philosophy of Yoga Pranayama – a
          unique sequence of breath control exercises Relaxation, Meditation and
          Mindfulness Stress and Anxiety Management Depression Management
          Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Self-Esteem and Confidence
          Building Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) Emotional Freedom
          Technique (EFT) Life Coaching
