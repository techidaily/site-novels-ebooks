          True life story demonstrating the many benefits of meditation, based
          on the author’s 44 years of daily meditation, more than 40 years of
          yoga and tai chi, and more than 20 years of qigong.
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          A guidebook to living a life of spirituality.
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          Written by a follower of the “Classic” spiritual masters: Sri Ramana
          Maharshi, Paramahansa Yogananda, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, Maharishi
          Mahesh Yogi, Yogi Amrit Desai, and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          This book lays out the real-life reasons why you should meditate, and
          the many benefits you can hope to achieve from your efforts. &nbsp;It
          does not tell or show you how to meditate.
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Journey with the author on a life-long quest to uncover
            the&nbsp;<strong>Ultimate Truth</strong>, that hidden reality that
            is the very essence of you and all that surrounds you. To answer the
            simple question “What’s it all about?”&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The first part of the book takes you on his more than 40-year
            journey of discovery, including trips to India, Egypt, and the
            sacred regions of the Himalayan mountains. Join his meditations at
            many week and months-long meditation training sessions.&nbsp; Enjoy
            his storytelling, parables, and adventures in self-discovery.&nbsp;
            Let his most personal experiences be your inspiration to start your
            own journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proven methods of self-realization and profound revelations are
            discussed in great (yet non-judgmental) detail as you travel his
            inspiring road to what the sages term
            "<strong>Enlightenment!</strong>"
          </p>
          <p>
            The second part of the book has the author attempting to describe
            the indescribable, as he shares what he has learned through his
            lifelong personal spiritual journey.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            “Enlightenment is the realization of one’s true Self, our true
            Being. Not our constantly changing body, thoughts, and emotions that
            we take to be who we are, but rather, the never changing, pure
            awareness, or consciousness, that lets us say:&nbsp;my body, my
            thoughts, my emotions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Happiness, contentment, and tranquil well-being are all parts of
            what he learned and experienced, leading him to finally pronounce
            “I’m just this seemingly nutty, crazy guy, who learned not to take
            anything too seriously, as all is not as it appears!”&nbsp;

          "An engaging combination of autobiography and philosophical treatise.
          ...&nbsp;By showing himself to be a regular guy gradually growing into
          this knowledge, Sambalino offers readers hope of success in their own
          personal journeys."

          “IS GOD IN THAT BOTTLE CAP is the remarkable description of author
          John Sambalino’s journey to discover the Ultimate Truth that surrounds
          us. Sambalino uses his personal experiences, storytelling, parables,
          and metaphors to encourage us to seek this Truth for ourselves, and he
          presents a vehicle, meditation, to help carry us towards our goal.
          Although words can never accurately describe this Ultimate Reality, IS
          GOD IN THAT BOTTLE CAP is a very readable, enjoyable, and practical
          sharing of the author’s experiences and insights." —

          “John Sambalino’s life has had many “wake-up” moments, and he
          describes these engagingly. I got the sense that John brought forward
          into this life many talents from the past, and has deepened his
          relationship with Reality through his earnest commitment to practice
          and inquiry. A fun ride and informative read.”

          “John Sambalino's unwavering curiosity sparked his passionate
          life-long search for Truth. Informative, but never preachy, Sambalino
          strikes the right balance for all who seek to find. His enlightened
          journey makes for a spirited and inspiring debut book.”&nbsp;<strong

          "An open-minded search for meaning that covers much literal and
