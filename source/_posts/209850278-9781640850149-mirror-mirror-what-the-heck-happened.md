            Life has had it’s challenges for most of us. Instead of a direct
            path from point A (where you started) to point B (where you want to
            be), the path contained many crossroads that included points of
            decision that put you on many windy roads, which may have hit you
            with a curve least expected. As children, the question many of you
            might have heard—what do you want to be when you grow up?&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Have
            you ever taken a look at your life and wondered "what the heck
            happened" to all the dreams and plans you had? Or said to yourself,
            "Life wasn't suppose to be this way." Or maybe even "It wasn't
            suppose to happen to me." Childhood trauma, accidents and injuries,
            addictions, betrayal, financial loss and pain happens to all of you
            at some time in your life. Maybe divorce, loss of a job or early
            death of a loved one. Life happens. And not always for the best.
            But—you have the power to change up the way you see life. There is a
            saying "we don't see things as they are, but we see things as WE
            are." &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Transcend the unseen forces of your
            past that hold you back from living your passion.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />What
            do you see when you look in the mirror? Not the mirror you look at
            in the morning that gives a reflection of your physical self, but
            the mirror of your internal being - soul and spirit. You reflect to
            others what you believe of yourself.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Your
            reflection is seen in everything you do. And others reflect back to
            you your conscious and subconscious beliefs. Your beliefs can be the
            unseen force that keeps you restricted in living life well until you
            find clarity of who you really are.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Mirror,
            Mirror, What the Heck Happened? will help you:&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Understand
            how unhealed hurts of the heart, spirit, and subconscious mind can
            sabotage your potential to live life well.&nbsp;<br />Identity
            possible generational threats that influence your life today and how
            to change them.&nbsp;<br />Explore the spiritual and personality
            gifts of God’s design for you and start living in the blessings He
            has for you. It is never too late.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allow yourself to journey&nbsp;the treasure hunt of self
            discovery—letting the REAL YOU come forth through practical
            applications that will inspire you to be who you were created to
            be—a person with a life full of passion and purpose.
