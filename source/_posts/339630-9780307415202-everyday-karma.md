            >“Wouldn’t it be heavenly to erase the mistakes of the past,
            eliminate confusion in your daily life, and feel safe about what
            tomorrow brings? In <i>Everyday Karma</i> I show you exactly how to
            do that. I demonstrate how day-to-day thoughts and actions can plant
            karmic seeds in your life that will either blossom like flowers or
            take over like weeds. This book will guide you into a deep
            understanding of your own karma and give you the tools to heal the
            past and discover a more joyful future.”<br />–CARMEN HARRA<br /></b
          ><br />The author of <i>Everyday Karma</i> is one of the great
          psychics of our time, a veritable “karmic counselor” whose gifts have
          enabled her to help presidents, first ladies, Wall Street executives,
          royalty, and Hollywood celebrities achieve their true destinies. She
          predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union, John Kennedy Jr.’s death,
          President Clinton’s impeachment, and major karmic events around the
          world with better than 90 percent accuracy.<br /><br />Now, in
          <i>Everyday Karma</i>, she invites you to embark upon a journey of
          healing and enlightenment–and to start living the life that is yours
          alone. Through her own spiritual biography (beginning with a
          near-death experience when she was young), true stories from many of
          her clients, and her predictions of coming events, you’ll be inspired
          to initiate your own spiritual evolution. With powerful, specially
          created meditations, prayers, and visualizations, she helps you
          resolve your specific problems, even deeply ingrained and
          self-destructive ways of thinking and behaving.<br /><br />Unique
          among books about spiritual growth and healing,
          <i>Everyday Karma</i> emphasizes the great power of the karmic energy
          within you that is waiting to be tapped–and tells you exactly how to
          set it free, including how to<br /><br />
          Enter the invisible world of spirit and light<br />
          Hear messages from your spirit guide<br />
          Create karmic relationships<br />
          Heal karmic wounds and improve your emotional and physical health<br />
          Discover your karmic life purpose<br />
          Bring fresh, positive, and balanced energy into your everyday world<br /><br />Most
          of us live our entire lives with, at best, a vague sense of
          dissatisfaction that even great fame and wealth seem unable to dispel.
          This book shows you another way. The lessons that Carmen Harra learned
          from the invisible world and shares with you here will light your path
          to a transformed and deeply fulfilled life in the visible world,
          starting here and now.
