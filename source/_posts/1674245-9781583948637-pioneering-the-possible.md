          Three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee Dr. Scilla Elworthy, a realist
          with 40 years' experience at the sharp end of politics and conflict,
          presents a bold but realistic vision for the future in
          <i>Pioneering the Possible</i>. Human beings worldwide are anxious,
          afraid for their children's futures, dissatisfied by their lives, but
          unsure what to do. Our global ecosystems and supply chains are under
          threat and our leaders appear to have failed us.
          <i>Pioneering the Possible</i> addresses these anxieties head-on by
          envisioning a future that could work for everyone, rich and poor,
          demonstrating with real-life examples how that future is already
          emerging. <i>Pioneering the Possible</i> tackles the deeply embedded
          20th-century values that get in the way of addressing global problems,
          and shows how these destructive values can be—and are
          being—reversed.<br /><br />
          We know the world is in crisis: we are spoiling our planet at such a
          rate that soon it may be unable to sustain human life. This crisis is
          in fact a vast opportunity, because a secure and satisfying future for
          all of humanity is perfectly possible if we make the right choices.
          But building such a future will require the leap in consciousness that
          Einstein indicated when he said, "No problem can be solved from the
          consciousness that created it."
          <i>Pioneering the Possible</i> investigates what this new
          consciousness is and takes us to meet the leaders who have learned to
          apply it. With profiles of individuals who exemplify transformative
          leadership such as Dr. Desmond Tutu and Aung San Suu Kyi, Dr. Elworthy
          demonstrates how anyone can develop the magnificent inner power to
          build their own personal contribution to the future and become a
          21st-century pioneer of what's possible. The book then contrasts the
          value systems that underpin our current decisions with the kind of
          values that would enable us to make better choices—those that could
          get us out of the mess we're in. To envision the kind of future that
          is possible—a lift-off into <i>life as it could be</i>—Elworthy calls
          on some experienced specialists to look through their telescopes into
          the future, then brings in the pragmatists who know what to do in
          their fields, because they've done it, tested it, and made it work.
          <i>Pioneering the Possible</i> ultimately helps you find your unique
          way to be useful; as Dr. Elworthy says, "to discover your mission and
          put it into action—instead of worrying on the sidelines—is to find
          peace of mind and a heart full of love."

          “Let this book wake you up to your own inner power—the capacity now
          required to help resolve global problems and build a world that works
          for all.”<br />—<b>Archbishop</b>&nbsp;<b>Desmond Mpilo Tutu</b>,
          Nobel Peace Prize Laureate<br /><br />
          “A work of lasting impact. <i>Visionary</i> is much too small a word
          to describe Scilla Elworthy.… Alongside an empathetic analysis of
          ‘some of the giants who have shown the way,’ this wise woman—herself a
          towering figure—offers readers a huge and motivating gift: an
          explanation of how ordinary individuals can change the world, and why
          they must wake up and do it.”—<b>Ambassador Swanee Hunt</b>, chair and
          founder&nbsp; of the Institute for Inclusive Security; Eleanor
          Roosevelt Lecturer of Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School of
          Government<br /><br />
          “They say it is better to light a candle than curse the dark. In this
          great book Scilla Elworthy sets the context of where we are as a
          society and shines a veritable searchlight on many practical and
          positive suggestions to some of today’s most intractable problems. A
          must-read for all those who want to be part of the solution!”—<b
            >Lawrence Bloom</b
          >, former chairman of the World Economic Forum, Global Agenda Council
          on Urban Management<br /><br />
          “We need women like Scilla Elworthy to challenge us to reorder our
          perspectives by drawing on the feminine in us all, including men, and
          finding the balance between ‘… the psychological and the political,
          between reflection and action’ so vital to a new world in which peace,
          equity, and justice might prevail.”—<b>Jane Tewson, CBE</b>, cofounder
          of Comic Relief<br /><br />
          “This is a book about radical leadership; it will give you the
          essential skills and inner power to help build a world that works for
          all, and to have a great time doing it.”—<b>Chade-Meng Tan</b>, Jolly
          Good Fellow of Google and author of <i>Search Inside Yourself<br /></i
          ><br />
          “This remarkable book serves as an intense course in human development
          in the light of social and ecological change.…”—<b
            >Jean Houston, PhD</b
          >, consultant to the United Nations in human development, author of
          <i>The Wizard of Us<br /></i><br />
          “This book by Scilla Elworthy is worthy of a strong push from all of
          us. If we are to create a sustainable civilization at his point in
          history (and we must, in order to survive) it is precisely this
          thinking and writing that must prevail.”—<b>Edgar Mitchell, ScD</b>,
          NASA astronaut, pilot of Apollo 14

        </h4>
        <p>
          Three-time Nobel Peace Prize nominee SCILLA ELWORTHY, PhD, founded the
          Oxford Research Group in 1982 to develop effective dialogue between
          nuclear weapons policy-makers worldwide and their critics. Their work
          included a series of dialogues between Chinese, Russian, and NATO
          nuclear scientists and the military, which formed the basis for later
          treaties. She founded Peace Direct in 2002 to fund, promote, and learn
          from local peace-builders in conflict areas, leading to the UN
          accepting the value and cost effectiveness of "locally-led"
          initiatives. Elworthy was awarded the Niwano Peace Prize in 2003. She
          was adviser to Peter Gabriel, Desmond Tutu, and Richard Branson in
          setting up The Elders and currently advises the boards of major
          international companies on future planning. She's chair of the Civil
          Society sector of the Hanwang Forum in China; a Councillor of the
          World Future Council; author of numerous books; a patron of Gender
          Rights and Equality Action Trust, MasterPeace, Oxford Research Group;
          and a member of the steering Committee of PAX, a service to help
          prevent wars and genocides. She received the Lifetime Achievement
          Award presented at the Voice of a Woman ceremony in July 2013.
