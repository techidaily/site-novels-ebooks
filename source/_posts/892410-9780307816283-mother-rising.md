          Different from a baby shower, where gifts are lavished upon the
          soon-to-be-born child, a blessingway ceremony honors the mother-to-be
          and creates a circle of support that will cradle her as she prepares
          to give birth. Surrounded by the most important women in her life, she
          can explore the challenges and joys that lie before her, gaining a
          sense of power and confidence that will help her rise to motherhood.
          MOTHER RISING shows women how to organize and personalize a
          blessingway for the expecting friends and family-an experience that
          will give the mother-to-be the best possible gifts of deep happiness,
          serenity, and abundance of love.A resource for planning and hosting a
          blessingway ceremony-a woman-centered celebration of the journey into
          motherhood.Ideal gift for or from an expectant mother who wants a more
          meaningful and transformational experience than the traditional,
          gift-focused baby shower.Outlines the five stages of the blessingway
          ritual, from establishing a safe and sacred space to honoring and
          pampering the mother-to-be.Finalist in both the 2004 Independent
          Publisher Book Awards and Foreword magazine's Book of the Year
          Awards.Features sidebars, inspirational quotations, resources, and
          checklists.
