          A guide to engage with the majesty and wisdom of unicorn energy
          <br /><br />• Reveals the role of unicorns in our soul evolvement
          today as well as in legends and myths and explains how they open our
          hearts, offer protection and support, and inspire us to choose actions
          for the highest benefit of all <br /><br />• Provides many exercises,
          meditations, ceremonies, dream work practices, and games to help you
          consciously connect with your unicorn, raise your energetic level, and
          spiritually progress on your journey to enlightenment <br /><br />•
          Shares anecdotes and real-life stories of people meeting unicorns and
          experiencing their energy <br /><br />Fully of the angelic realms,
          unicorns live in the seventh dimension, the seventh heaven. These
          beautiful creatures are aspects of the divine, in the same way angels
          are. While angels work through the heart, unicorns work with the soul
          and help you fulfill your pre-life contracts through their energy.
          <br /><br />In <i>The Wonder of Unicorns</i> Diana Cooper explains
          ancient myths and legends of these amazing energetic beings from a
          higher spiritual perspective. Who are they, these seventh-dimensional
          creatures of myth and magic? Where do they stand in the angelic
          hierarchy and what is their role with regard to us humans? How can you
          meet and engage with them as an individual? <br /><br />These magical
          beings of light, absent from the Earth for many centuries, are now
          returning to guide humanity on their spiritual path. Prevalent in the
          times of Atlantis, unicorns open hearts through bringing in joy,
          wisdom, and healing. They offer protection and support and inspire us
          to choose actions for the highest benefit of all. Consciously
          connecting and working with your unicorn will enable you to raise your
          energetic level and assist you on your journey to enlightenment.
          Create a unicorn humming ball, engage in a unicorn healing, or join in
          dream work with your unicorn. <br /><br />Whether aspiring to help the
          world at large or simply improve a small corner of it, enlightenment
          seekers can apply the meditations, rituals, ceremonies, and games
          featured in this book to unleash the great abilities of these elusive
          spirit guides. With wonderful real life stories and anecdotes from
          people who have seen and experienced unicorns first hand,
          <i>The Wonder of Unicorns</i> is a book to inspire and empower you on
          your spiritual path.
