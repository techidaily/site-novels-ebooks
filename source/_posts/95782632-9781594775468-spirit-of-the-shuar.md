          • Discover the thoughts, history, and customs of the Shuar of the
          Amazon, as told in their own words.<br /><br />• Tribe members explain
          their practices of shapeshifting and headhunting; the interdependence
          of humans and the environment; the role of ecstatic sex; their belief
          in war as a path to peace; and their faith in <i>arutam</i>, the life
          spirit. <br /><br />The indomitable Shuar of the Amazon--reputed to be
          the only tribe in the Americas that has never been conquered--have
          lived as warriors, hunters, cultivators, and healers for generations.
          Even in today's acquisitive, often wasteful world they defend their
          rainforests and sustainable ways of life and offer their philosophy of
          love, joy, and hope. <br /><br />More than three decades after first
          befriending members of the Shuar, author and environmentalist John
          Perkins and his publisher, Ehud Sperling, inspired Shakaim Mariano
          Chumpi-a young Shuar warrior who has fought in the jungle war between
          his native Ecuador and Peru-to travel among his people and record
          their thoughts, history, and customs. The result is
          <i>Spirit of the Shuar</i>. <br /><br />Here, in their own words, the
          Shuar share their practices of shapeshifting, "dreaming the world,"
          and ecstatic sex, including the role older women play in teaching
          uninitiated men how to please. They explain the interdependence of
          humans and the environment, their formula for peace and balance, and
          their faith in arutam, the life-giving spirit of nature that allows
          each of us to transform ourselves. And they describe how their
          ancient-and current-practice of shrinking heads fits into their
          cultural philosophy. <br /><br />Whether exploring the mystery of
          shamanic shapeshifting, delving deeper into the powers of healing
          herbs and psychotropic plants, or finding new ways to live sustainably
          and sensitively in the face of encroaching development and
          environmental destruction, the Shuar have emerged as a strong people
          determined to preserve their identity and beliefs and share their
          teachings with a world in dire need of their wisdom. <br /><br />A
          portion of the proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to
          the Ayumpum Foundation to help the Shuar conserve their forests and
          spread their message.
