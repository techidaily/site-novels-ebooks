            Archangels</b
          ><br /><br />• 2024 Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold Award<br /><br />•
          Shares 63 healing visualizations to transform fear, resolve debt, and
          become receptive to the infinite bounty of the Universe<br /><br />•
          Learn how to tap in to the singing colors of the Central Sun that are
          mirrored in your chakras and raise your vibration to attract
          wealth—not only financial wealth, but anything you need to receive
          from Source to feel safe, happy, healthy, and free<br /><br />• Offers
          nighttime practices to support your transformation into a vessel to
          receive the full blessings of Source as well as advanced practices to
          transform suffering<br /><br />You are personally invited by the 12
          Archangels to receive all that you desire from Source, especially the
          true happiness that often seems out of reach. Your Soul has the clear
          guidance and tools to help you move from lack to abundance and attract
          wealth and healing and the Archangels will show you how.
          <br /><br />Speaking through Belinda Womack, who has been a channel
          for the 12 Archangels for more than 30 years, the Angels explain that
          the root issue behind our lack of abundance is the fear of not enough.
          Sharing 64 healing visualizations, the Angels guide you to dissolve
          the deep subconscious layers of guilt and shame that keep you stuck in
          a fear-induced lack of wealth and become receptive to the infinite
          bounty of the Universe. Reading the visualizations from the 12
          Archangels, with intention, helps you tap into the singing colors and
          undiluted love of the Central Sun mirrored in your chakras. The
          visualizations raise the vibration of your thoughts, feelings, and
          beliefs to attract wealth—not only financial gain but all that you
          need to receive from Source to feel safe, happy, healthy, and free.
          <br /><br />The 12 Archangels share lessons on the relationship
          between money and divine law, how to cultivate your garden of
          intuition and creativity, and how to resolve financial debt with
          understanding and love. They offer nighttime practices that support
          your transformation into a vessel to receive the full blessings of
          Source. They also offer advanced practices on harnessing your innate
          power to transform suffering. <br /><br />Helping you connect with the
          boundless care and “deep pockets” of your Soul to transform financial
          struggles and eliminate self-doubt, the 12 Archangels show that life
          keeps improving when you make room for the vast flow of creative
          genius and abundance coming from the Universe through the divine
          feminine.

        <p>
          “In their new book, the 12 Archangels make it clear that to solve the
          problems we face as human beings we must transform our own heartache,
          both known to us as well as what is hidden in the deep subconscious.
          In this practical guide, channeled at the pure frequency of love, the
          Angels show us the way to free ourselves, and the collective, from
          lack and suffering. It begins with connecting with Source through the
          feminine so that we rise from limitations imposed on us by the old
          male patriarchy. Bravo, Belinda and the Angels, for revealing the
          truth about money and lighting the path to real abundance.”
