          What I hope to accomplish in this book is to give writing prompts that
          will help you to get past all the outside influences that keep you
          from believing in yourself and in your ability to write. In order to
          write, you need to get rid of notions about language, poetic form, and
          esoteric subject matter â€” all the things that the poetry police have
          told you are essential if you are to write. I wanted to start from a
          different place, a place controlled by instinct rather than by
          intelligence. Revision, the shaping and honing of the poem, should
          come later, and, in revising, care always needs to be taken to retain
          the vitality and electricity of the poem. Anyone can learn to craft a
          capable poem, but it is the poems that retain that initial vitality
          that we remember; these are the poems that teach us how to be human.
