          Reiki: A Miraculous Journey into Holistic Healing takes the reader
          into an autobiographical journey of healing which anyone can embark
          on, and is especially meant for persons who have not been able to find
          answers for their health issues in traditional western medicine. The
          book addresses a complementary path of healing with a strong emphasis
          on Reiki but is totally inclusive of any other avenue that leads to
          wholeness and good health. This book addresses taking responsibility
          for our lives and becoming pioneers of our own healing. It addresses
          how physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual healing need to
          be integrated in order for a person to feel fully alive and whole. The
          story is told by Sister Eileen Curteis and is about her forty year
          journey into healing, the insights and wisdom she has gained, as one
          of life's travellers in search of wholeness. The story is told through
          Eileen's prose, poetry and art. About the Author: Eileen Curteis, a
          Sister of Saint Ann, is a Reiki Master teacher and practitioner, who
          has treated and taught thousands of people over the last twenty-three
          years. After the closure of Queenswood Retreat and Spirituality Centre
          where she had worked for seventeen years, Eileen carried on the legacy
          of the former Queenswood by obtaining a fifteen year trademark for
          Queenswood School of Reiki. She then went on to establish, with the
          help of other dedicated women, Queenswood Holistic Healing and
          Spirituality Society. Preceding this, Sister Eileen was a teacher,
          principal and educator for twenty-seven years. Her greatest passion
          lies in her healing ministry and in the literary arts. She has
          authored eleven books to date and has become an accomplished poet,
          artist and writer, as well as being a producer of six CDs and three
          films. She lives in Victoria, BC.
