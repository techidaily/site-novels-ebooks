          <p>
            The dictionaries define the word aura as: "Any subtle, invisible
            emanation or exhalation." The English authorities, as a rule,
            attribute the origin of the word to a Latin term meaning "air," but
            the Hindu authorities insist that it had its origin in the Sanscrit
            root Ar, meaning the spoke of a wheel, the significance being
            perceived when we remember the fact that the human aura radiates
            from the body of the individual in a manner similar to the radiation
            of the spokes of a wheel from the hub thereof. The Sanscrit origin
            of the term is the one preferred by occultists, although it will be
            seen that the idea of an aerial emanation, indicated by the Latin
            root, is not foreign to the real significance of the term.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be the real origin of the term what it may, the idea of the human
            aura is one upon which all occultists are in full agreement and
            harmony, and the mention of which is found in all works upon the
            general subject of occultism. So we shall begin by a consideration
            of the main conception thereof, as held by all advanced occultists,
            ancient and modern, omitting little points of theoretical variance
            between the different schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Briefly, then, the human aura may be described as a fine, ethereal
            radiation or emanation surrounding each and every living human
            being. It extends from two to three feet, in all directions, from
            the body. It assumes an oval shape - a great egg-shaped nebula
            surrounding the body on all sides for a distance of two or three
            feet. This aura is sometimes referred to, in ordinary terms, as the
            "psychic atmosphere" of a person, or as his "magnetic atmosphere."
          </p>
          <p>
            This atmosphere or aura is apparent to a large percentage of persons
            in the sense of the psychic awareness generally called "feeling,"
            though the term is not a clear one. The majority of persons are more
            or less aware of that subtle something about the personality of
            others, which can be sensed or felt in a clear though unusual way
            when the other persons are near by, even though they may be out of
            the range of the vision. Being outside of the ordinary range of the
            five senses, we are apt to feel that there is something queer or
            uncanny about these feelings of projected personality. But every
            person, deep in his heart, knows them to be realities and admits
            their effect upon his impressions regarding the persons from whom
            they emanate. Even small children, infants even, perceive this
            influence, and respond to it in the matter of likes and dislikes.
