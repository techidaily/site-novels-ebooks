          <br />Psychedelic medicines also known as entheogens are entering the
          mainstream. And it’s no wonder: despite having access to the latest
          wellness trends and advances in technology, we’re no healthier,
          happier, or more meaningfully connected. Psilocybin mushrooms,
          ayahuasca, and LSD—as well as other time-tested techniques with the
          power to shift consciousness such as drumming, meditation, and vision
          quests—are now being recognized as potent catalysts for change and
          healing. But how do we ensure that we’re approaching them
          effectively?<br />&nbsp;<br />Françoise Bourzat—a counselor and
          experienced guide with sanctioned training in the Mazatec and other
          indigenous traditions—and healer Kristina Hunter introduce a holistic
          model focusing on the threefold process of preparation, journey, and
          integration. Drawing from more than thirty years of experience,
          Bourzat’s skillful and heartfelt approach presents the therapeutic
          application of expanded states, without divorcing them from their
          traditional contexts. <i>Consciousness Medicine</i> delivers a
          coherent map for navigating nonordinary states of consciousness,
          offering an invaluable contribution to the field of healing and
          transformation.

          "<i>Consciousness Medicine</i> is an insightful and inspiring
          introduction to expanded states of consciousness. Françoise Bourzat
          combines an intimate personal account with the most comprehensive and
          practical guide I have seen to transpersonal experience and shamanic
          work, emphasizing the three cornerstones of preparation, journeying
          and—of essential importance—integration."<br />—Gabor Maté MD, author
          of&nbsp;<i
            >In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters With Addiction<br /></i
          ><br />“A lovely reading experience and immensely informative, this
          book should be on&nbsp;the bookshelf of everyone interested in the
          subject of consciousness change and&nbsp;spiritual growth.”<br />
          —Ann Shulgin, coauthor of <i>PiHKAL</i> and <i>TiHKAL</i
          ><br /><br />"It is a pleasure to recommend Francoise
          Bourzat’s&nbsp;<i>Consciousness Medicine</i>. Ms. Bourzat has an
          extensive background as a teacher and facilitator of altered states of
          consciousness, utilizing a variety of techniques including meditation,
          vision quests, sweat lodges, and entheogens. Regarding entheogens,
          also known as psychedelics and hallucinogens, Ms. Bourzat has done
          considerable fieldwork among the indigenous Mazatec people of Mexico,
          who have a vast history and knowledge of the spiritual and healing
          properties of psilocybin mushrooms and other psychotropic plants.
          Having worked closely for many years with these native healers, Ms.
          Bourzat has acquired considerable insight into these ancient practices
          that she has transmitted to the many contemporary students and seekers
          whom she has worked with over the past thirty-five years. Given the
          increasing interest in the range of effects and applications of
          psychedelic plants in the modern era, Ms. Bourzat’s knowledge holds
          great relevance to today’s world. As such, this book will make a
          valuable contribution to our growing knowledge base and appreciation
          of the salutary potential these compounds possess."<br />—Charles S.
          Grob, MD,&nbsp;professor of psychiatry, UCLA School of Medicine<br /><br />"Françoise
          is uniquely qualified to write this book. She not only has the
          multicultural training and a deep and real connection with indigenous
          traditional healing techniques, but she has for decades applied,
          tested, and extended these techniques, specifically for the training
          of Western therapists. Her own Western training was first class, and
          perhaps because of that, she is not caught up in idolizing or
          fantasizing the value of either Western psychodynamic therapies and
          research or these older systems of indigenous healing. Her work blends
          both in a blend appropriate for this time and this culture. She has no
          ideological ax to grind, but only to press for effective practice for
          the healer and for their clients."<br />—James Fadiman, PhD, author of

            >The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide: Safe, Therapeutic and Sacred
            Journeys</i
          ><br /><br />"Francoise Bouzat is courageously and profoundly
          dedicated to helping others grow and heal to their full potential
          using the most effective tools of which she is aware. Her commitment
          to her clients has been forged in the context of the global drug war,
          which has criminalized psychedelics and has tempered her like steel as
          she has continued to explore the healing potential of these substances
          revered in most cultures but demonized in ours. Fortunately for us
          all, there's a global renaissance in psychedelic research and the
          therapeutic and spiritual use of psychedelics. Francoise is a
          visionary pioneer whose life's work is making a major contribution to
          the process of transforming psychedelics into legal tools for healing
          and spirituality."<br />—Rick Doblin, founder and executive director
          of&nbsp;the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies
          (MAPS)&nbsp;<br /><br />"Francoise has been a student and friend of
          mine for over thirty years.… &nbsp;When I met Francoise, she was
          soft-spoken, alert, respectful, and very observant. She was at home.
          Our Native American way of life is not a religion, it is a "Way of
          Life." When I met Francoise, she was living this way of life, living
          in the mountains, living in nature and teaching her students they are
          one with nature. Francoise was already connected to our Mother Earth
          and our Way of Life was not a mystery or difficult for her to connect
          to."<br />—Marilyn Youngbird,&nbsp;Chief Woman among Chiefs, Arikara

        </h4>
        <p>
          FRANÇOISE BOURZAT&nbsp;is a consciousness guide and&nbsp;counselor.
          She has a master’s degree in Somatic Psychology&nbsp;from New College
          of California and is Hakomi trained. Residing in the
          San&nbsp;Francisco Bay Area, she has been weaving the
          healing&nbsp;potential of expanded states of consciousness
          and&nbsp;psychology together in her practice for over
          thirty&nbsp;years. After traveling the world as a young
          woman,&nbsp;Françoise&nbsp;found her way to San Francisco in the early
          1980s. It was there she&nbsp;met her first teacher, a pioneer
          exploring the intersection of indigenous healing&nbsp;and
          psychotherapy. She later met her teacher of the last twenty years,
          an&nbsp;indigenous Mazatec woman leading healing ceremonies with
          sacred mushrooms&nbsp;in the high mountains of Southern Mexico.
          Drawing from years of&nbsp;close apprenticeship with her Mazatec
          teacher, as well as training in other&nbsp;indigenous traditions,
          Fran.oise has developed a comprehensive approach&nbsp;that bridges
          Western and indigenous modalities for healing and growth.&nbsp;She
          trains therapists and facilitators, teaches at the California
          Institute of&nbsp;Integral Studies (CIIS), and lectures
          internationally.<br /><br /><br />KRISTINA HUNTER&nbsp;is a healing
          guide, writer, and Certified&nbsp;Hakomi Practitioner living in the
          San Francisco&nbsp;Bay Area. She has spent over ten years
          traveling&nbsp;the world, studying the transformative potential
          of&nbsp;expanded states of consciousness. Her work explores&nbsp;the
          intersection of psychology, plant medicine, and&nbsp;Buddhist
          meditation. She offers individual counseling&nbsp;and integration
          support for psychedelic and&nbsp;initiatory experiences. She also
          offers mentoring and consultation to healing&nbsp;practitioners who
          wish to integrate expanded states of consciousness into&nbsp;their
          practice.
