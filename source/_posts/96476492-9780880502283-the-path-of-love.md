          Kabir is a 15th-century Indian mystic. Born a lower-caste weaver,
          Kabir opposed superstition, empty ritualism and bigotry. His teachings
          include scathing attacks against Brahmanical pride, caste prejudice
          and the very concept of untouchability, as well as exposing the
          dogmatism and bigotry he perceived around him. Unusually, even for his
          time, he was embraced by disciples who had been raised in both Hindu
          and Muslim traditions, who saw in him the embodiment of a
          life-affirmative approach that transcended the narrow dogmas that
          divide people and set them against one another.<br /><br />A poet,
          weaver, husband and father, Kabir lived his life as a buddha and yet
          as an ordinary man. His poetic songs tell of the ecstasy and the
          pitfalls on a seeker’s journey on the path of love. In this book, Osho
          introduces the reader to this extraordinary mystic and his songs,
          bringing both to light in such a way as to show how they are both
          timeless and utterly relevant to our time. The path of love as
          described by Osho, and though the songs of Kabir, is a journey that
          seeks out and celebrates the divine that is hidden in the ordinary,
          the love that becomes not just a feeling one has, but ultimately a
          state of being that one is.<br /><br />Each song of the bird, and each
          cloud floating in the sky, is something like a message, a coded
          message. You have to decode it, you have to look deep into it; you
          have to be silent and listen to the message.” <br /><br /><br /><br />
