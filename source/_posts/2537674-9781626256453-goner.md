            Louis Brawley met UG Krishnamurti in 2002 and spent the following
            five years travelling with him in the USA, India and Europe keeping
            a record of this remarkable non-teacher and documenting his own
            inner struggles as his ideas about life, love and Enlightenment were
            constantly tossed around and demolished. Louis fell into the role of
            foil and sidekick to UG’s bizarre interactions with his friends and
            audience and, as UG’s health deteriorated, he became his informal
            caregiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louis Brawley doesn’t use honeyed platitudes to tell the story of a
            sage and his devoted follower; instead he tells an often
            unflattering story of his own struggles and shortcomings and the
            dynamic uncertainties of life with a man who “tore apart everything
            human beings have built up inside and out for centuries.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Goner will teach you the meaning of the phrase “paradoxical truth”.
            UG Krishnamurti gave up everything for truth, but delighted in
            ridiculous fabrications; he was a teacher who refused to teach, a
            man who mocked do-gooders but was deeply kind; he was chaste but
            foul mouthed, he was a man who decried the supernatural … yet there
            were strange coincidences around him. “…the way he lived, his living
            quarters and his mode of expression were one continuous movement, a
            three dimensional, living book of teaching. If you were observant,
            you could learn from him on contact with no need for explanation.”
