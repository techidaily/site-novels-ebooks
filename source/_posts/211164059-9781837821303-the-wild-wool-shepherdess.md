            >Reconnect to the wisdom of the land, animals and the moon, and be
            inspired to find your power and freedom in this poetic memoir.</b
          ><br /><br />Do you long to be amongst nature, in the wild, remote,
          untouched places, where the moon nears full, and the energy is visible
          and present? Do you feel as if you don’t really belong, and that there
          is something missing in your life?<br /><br />Full of incredible and
          transformative stories of a life with her flock, and wolf companion,
          ancient craft techniques, animal messengers, sacred places and
          Indigenous wisdom, Elizabeth Iekawehatie Kneafsey tells the story of
          how she found her place in the world, and how you can find your unique
          path, too.<br /><br />From her childhood in a Nottinghamshire pit
          village, to creating a new life in harmony with nature and
          rediscovering the wild woman within, this book will show you that it
          is possible to live a different way – one where you are deeply
          connected to the earth, animals, and your powerful feminine wisdom.

          "I enjoyed reading, to feel the spiritual and physical work in
          Iekawehatie’s (Elizabeth’s adopted name) life is an endless cliff
          hanger. She walks the path of the <i>okwaho</i>, the wolf, or
          path-maker in our language. A truly inspiring lifesaver who honours
          the ways of my people and every creature upon Mother Earth."&nbsp;-

          read… a little… and then I couldn't stop…. This book is tremendous:

          stop!"&nbsp;- <b>Rosamund Young</b>, bestselling author of

          is a primal call to awaken and align ourselves with nature and its
          cycles, advocating for a life deeply rooted in the rhythms of the
          Earth and body. This book is a rare gem, weaving hands-on practices
          and sharing the howl, hoot and bleat of the land and its animals. It
          relights old hilltop fires, sending out a beacon to those willing to

          spins us into her personal journey of awakening and deepening, and her
          expansive vision of women’s ancient mythology and sacred magic. We
          wander through the hills with her as she tends her sheep, then we dive
          with her into a spiritual journey that shakes her soul to its core. At
          one point, she says, “I want to know what you ache for, what you
          agonize over, what are you trying to remember?” She has given us her
          own answer here…"&nbsp;- <b>Carolyn Hillyer</b>, author of

          the pathways of the sacred and find meaning, purpose and our soul’s
          path in the ways of the wild. Inspiring and intriguing in equal
