          <i>Lessons from the Monk I Married</i> offers up ten of the most
          powerful lessons about life, love, and spirituality that Katherine
          Jenkins has gathered during her marriage to former Buddhist monk Seong
          Yoon Lee. <br /><br />A seeker in the truest sense of the word,
          Jenkins went to Korea on a whim, hoping to find the answers to her
          deepest, most pressing questions about how to find peace and her
          purpose in life. During her first months there, she sought out a
          remote temple, where she unknowingly crossed paths with an unassuming
          Buddhist monk. Months later, they met again by chance—and fell in
          love. Though their courtship was long, mostly secretive, and fraught
          with logistical and spiritual considerations, Jenkins and Lee were
          ultimately married in Korea in 2003. Through their relationship,
          Jenkins discovered the most important lesson of all: No one holds the
          keys to peace and happiness—you have walk your <i>own</i> path and
          find your <i>own</i> wisdom through your <i>own</i> experiences.
          <br /><br />More than the improbable story of a girl from Seattle who
          found peace of mind (and love) with a Buddhist monk,
          <i>Lessons from the Monk I Married</i> is an approachable guide to the
          most elemental spiritual questions of our day.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Katherine Jenkins is the author of the popular blog Lessons from the
          Monk I Married, which offers lessons based in the Buddhist tradition
          and drawn from her daily experiences. She is a regular contributor to
          Woman’s World Online Magazine, and the founder of Writers Rising, a
          blog she started for writers, which now has over twenty contributors.
          <br /><br />Jenkins spent over eight years in South Korea, where she
          met her husband in 1996. That same year, she went to Nepal and joined
          a ten-day silent meditation course. That ten-day course changed her
          life and she has been practicing Vipassana meditation ever since.
          <br /><br />Jenkins moved back to the States with her husband in 2006,
          where they became managers of the Northwest Vipassana Meditation
          Center in Washington State. During her time at the meditation center,
          she helped edit the book Letters from the Dhamma Brothers, which was
          featured on Oprah Winfrey’s Soul Series in October of 2008.
          <br /><br />Today, Jenkins lives in Seattle with her husband, a
          popular yoga teacher and lecturer, and she teaches English as a Second
          Language at Edmonds Community College. <br />
