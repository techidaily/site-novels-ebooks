          ><br />Kaitlin Roig-Debellis is the first-grade teacher at Sandy Hook
          Elementary School who saved her entire class of fifteen six-
          and-seven-year-olds from the tragic events that took place on December
          14, 2012, by piling them into a single-occupancy bathroom within her
          classroom, mere feet from the brutal and indiscriminate massacre
          taking place outside the door. Since then, despite the unimaginably
          painful experiences she endured, she has chosen to share her
          experience with others, in the hope that they too can find light in
          dark moments.<br /><br /><i>Choosing Hope</i> is a lot of things. A
          written witness to a tragedy that will never be forgotten. A gripping
          firsthand testament to the power of good over the power of
          destruction. An inspirational memoir by a brave young woman whose
          story is one of courage, heroism, faith, and resilience. And a
          celebration of all the people who make the choice to pass along their
          hope and positivity to young ones—parents, mentors, and especially
          teachers. There is no moving on, but there is always moving forward.
          And how we move forward is a choice.<br /><br /><b

          all heart. Ms. Roig-DeBellis witnessed the absolute worst of mankind
          and survived; in its aftermath, she chose to move forward—and she
          implores readers to do the same, regardless of their circumstances. By
          choosing hope over pessimism, love over hate, and compassion over
          ambivalence, we choose to live within light even when darkness
          threatens to descend. That’s a lesson entirely worthy of learning, and
          sharing—and there’s nobody better to teach it.”—Examiner.com<i
