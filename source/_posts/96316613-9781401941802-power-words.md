            >Words carry powerful energy and have an astonishing impact on your
            life. With Power Words, you can generate new actions and
            lightning-fast results!<br /></b

          direct.<br /><br />Best-selling author and acclaimed intuitive
          <b>Sharon Anne Klingler</b> will show you how these high-energy words
          can immediately lift your power and alter every aspect of your
          reality—from the simple, such as aligning your posture and improving
          sleep patterns, to the life changing, such as stimulating creative
          ideas, increasing personal wealth, and finding new relationships.
          Choose the precise words that provide extraordinary success, and learn
          to direct profound force to all of your goals. <i>Power Words</i> can
          create an electrical current in your life that can strike like
          lightning and illuminate your world!

          "I love this book! Power Words is perhaps the most profound,
          transformative book ever written on the influence that our internal
          (and external) language has on our lives. In an easily accessible
          style, Sharon Anne Klingler demonstrates the energy and effect of
          every word we use. Highly recommended, this book can change your
          life."<br />— Denise Linn, Author, The Secret Language of Signs and
          Sacred Space<br /><br />"Your words carry energy, and they shape your
          life. In Power Words Sharon Anne Klingler helps you to become a
          maestro of your words—appreciating them, loving them, choosing them in
          ways that steer your life toward your heart’s desire. This book will
          forever change your relationship with words, the most intimate
          companions of your mind. I highly recommend it."<br />— Donna Eden,
          Author, Energy Medicine<br /><br />"Sharon Anne Klingler has written
          the book I wish I had! Power Words takes all the elements of instant
          creation and puts them into doable, fun, empowering exercises we can
          all choose in the snap of a finger. A new, fresh take on the
          simplicity of creation itself."<br />— Dee Wallace, Actress, Author,
          International Speaker, and Radio Host<br /><br />"What a simple but
          brilliant idea! Sharon Anne Klingler brings a heightened awareness to
          this ever so important thing we do every day. She provides countless
          examples so that you can ignite your own life with the power of words.

          inspiring, and they work very quickly!"<br />— Mary McCann, Actress,
          Atlantic Theater Company Member<br /><br />"As a practicing
          psychologist and hypnotherapist, I’ve incorporated the principles in
          Power Words with my clients. I believe that therapists of every stripe
          will find Power Words applicable as a powerful intervention and
          homework tool. This book also lends itself to those in the world of
          interpersonal communication, advertising, and marketing. Most
          surprising, Sharon’s book installed an unconscious positive technique
          in me that fits my psychology. I recommend this book to all who are on
          a path of personal growth. It’s full of simple exercises, examples,
          and wisdoms that can help anyone and everyone!"<br />— Michael
