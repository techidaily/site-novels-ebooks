          The Magic of Mindfulness is a nonfiction motivational self-help book
          written by K P Weaver. Weaver is an advanced mindfulness practitioner
          who has founded her own publishing company and is a public speaker and
          author. She’s accomplished all this while raising a family of six
          small kids at the same time. Her secret is based on the concept of
          allowing the magic to assist you through being mindful, practicing
          gratitude and keeping your focus on your goals. She has organized her
          material into seven sections, each of which is followed by an exercise
          to allow the reader to fully absorb and be able to utilize the
          material covered. McDermott also shares her own life story, beginning
          with her move from her native Northern Ireland to Australia while
          pregnant. She uses her story to illustrate key concepts and offers the
          reader ample opportunities to share their story as well.<br /><br />K
          P Weaver’s nonfiction motivational self-help book,The Magic of
          Mindfulness, is a well-written and appealing call to action that shows
          how one’s attitude and approach to life can make all the difference.
          Weaver’s own story is inspirational and is the clearest recommendation
          for her approach, but her presentation of the seven precepts is also
          first-rate. Weaver’s writing style is smooth and conversational,
          making it feel as though she’s the reader’s own personal coach, and
          her assignments work quite well in helping the reader feel ownership
          of the material covered. I’m still amazed that the mother of six could
          have written over twenty books, founded a publishing company and done
          as much as she has. Her system is obviously working. The Magic of
          Mindfulness is most highly recommended.
