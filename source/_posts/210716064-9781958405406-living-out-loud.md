              find ourselves with a mind full of limits.</span

              from being seen, away from being who she really was. Living life
              in the shadows of fear, shame, and self-doubt. Angela feels

          Angela Wilson has provided a great space to create a positive and
          welcoming relationship with money. I am much more confident and
          excited to live my life knowing that I now have the tools and
          knowledge to control my dreams!"
        </p>
        <p>- Rachel Becker</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          Working with Angela has transformed my relationship to my personal
          finances as well as my beliefs surrounding money and abundance. Angela
          consistently encourages me to dream bigger and more creatively; when I
          do, she is prepared with multiple ways that my present or future
          financial situation can help me accomplish my goals.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          Every session with Angela has left me more empowered and confident in
          making informed and heart-centered decisions about my future. I am
          deeply grateful for the wisdom she has imparted to me, guiding me to
          deeply honor and invest in myself and my dreams.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          I cannot imagine a better combination of intelligence/left-brain
          competence and genuine compassion and encouragement than that which
          Angela naturally brings to her financial coaching. I'd recommend her
          again and again!
        </p>

        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          Angela's journey is a multi-layered story of bullying and low
          self-esteem. Step by step, Angela shows us that what comes "after"
          counts way more than what went "before." Proof that the possibilities
          are endless when you believe in yourself. Now each day for her is a
          step forward. Angela's story is a must-read for anyone who has
          suffered with these issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I attended Angela Wilson's workshop, I thought it would just be a
          refresher on information I already knew; I left the program with a
          greater understanding of my attitudes toward money and with very new
          ideas about making it work for me. I am much more motivated, and I'm
          confident that, not only can I meet my current goals, I can surpass
          them!
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>Then I read Angela's book.</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          I think that anyone who reads this book will connect with the content
          in some way - we all have that inner chatter telling us that we can't
          do things. The voice is especially strong in girls because not only is
          it parents, teachers, and friends; it's also books, tv, movies, and
          magazines! I LOVED it!
