          Discover the shamanic powers within each of us<br /><br />• Explores
          ayahuasca rituals in the Amazon, messages from power animals and plant
          spirits, intuitive dreams, soul retrieval, and holograms of past lives
          and spirits<br /><br />• Explains the shamanic way of “seeing” to
          diagnose spiritual, emotional, and physical ailments via candle
          readings, remote viewing, and shamanic journeys<br /><br />• Details
          how the author has helped individuals communicate with loved ones who
          have passed on and release themselves from negative spirits<br /><br />Each
          and every one of us has shamanic powers. Glimpses of them can arise at
          any age in the form of intuitive dreams, déjà vu, spontaneous visions,
          and out-of-body experiences. Most people dismiss these experiences.
          However, by embracing these gifts, we can unlock our shamanic
          potential to change ourselves and the world around us.<br /><br />Revealing
          his transformation from skeptic to respected shamanic healer, Itzhak
          Beery explains how, after countless prescient dreams and visions
          throughout his life that he brushed off, a series of synchronistic
          events led to his first shamanism workshop with Michael Harner,
          renowned shamanism scholar and teacher. This, in turn, led to a trip
          to South America with John Perkins to work with indigenous shamanic
          healers. <br /><br />Beery shares his experiences with ayahuasca
          rituals in the Amazon, messages from power animals and plant spirits,
          dreams that foretold future events, and holographic sightings of past
          lives and spiritual entities, both evil and benign. He details his
          shamanic way of “seeing” to diagnose spiritual, emotional, and
          physical ailments via candle readings and remote viewing. Explaining
          how we are always surrounded by spirits, he recounts helping people
          communicate with loved ones who have passed on and shares powerful
          stories of soul retrieval during shamanic journeys to other worlds.<br /><br />Through
          his true stories of visions that manifested in reality, Beery reveals
          that we are all shamans. By igniting our natural intuition and
          developing trust for our inner powers, we can each connect to the
          oneness of nature where all knowledge is found.
