            >Designed to be used with any deck, <i>Red Tarot</i> is a radical
            praxis and decolonized oracle that moves beyond self-help and
            divination to reclaim tarot for liberation, self-determination, and
            collective healing.<br />
            <br />
            For readers of <i>Postcolonial Astrology</i> and
            <i>Tarot for Change</i></b
          ><br /><br /><b><i>Red Tarot </i></b>speaks to anyone othered for
          their identity or ways of being or thinking—LGBTQIA2S+ and BIPOC folks
          in particular—presenting the tarot as a radical epistemology that
          shifts the authority of knowing into the hands of the people
          themselves.<br /><br />Author Christopher Marmolejo frames literacy as
          key to liberation, and explores an understanding of tarot as critical
          literacy. They show how the cards can be read to subvert the dynamics
          of white supremacist-capitalist-imperialist-patriarchy, weaving
          historical context and spiritual practice into a comprehensive
          overview of tarot.<br /><br />Situating tarot imagery within
          cosmologies outside the Hellenistic frame—Death as interpreted through
          the lens of Hindu goddess Chhinnamasta, the High Priestess through
          Aztec goddess Coyolxauhqui—Marmolejo’s <i><b>Red Tarot </b></i>is a
          profound act of native reclamation and liberation. Each card’s
          interpretation is further bolstered by the teachings of Toni Morrison,
          bell hooks, Paulo Freire, José Esteban Muñoz, and others, in an
          offering that integrates intersectional wisdom with the author’s
          divination practice—and reveals tarot as an essential language for
          liberation.

          “<i>Red Tarot</i> passionately reindigenizes the symbolism of each
          tarot card and demonstrates the importance of this reclamation. Along
          with illuminating bold interpretations of the tarot, it pulls the
          reader into each tarot narrative in a brilliant and poetic manner. I
          loved this book!”<br />—Erika Buenaflor, MA, JD, author of
          <i>Cleansing Rites of Curanderismo</i> and
          <i>Veneration Rites of Curanderismo</i><br /><br />“<i>Red Tarot</i>
          is a volume that truly, as in its own words, readies its reader to
          come as ‘part prophet, part poet, part political participant.’ This is
          a generous book. Marmolejo has done something truly wonderful here.
          They have made a book that makes it possible for you to engage with
          the future in the best way possible which is with the feeling of
          blowing your brain hole open. Anyone who hungers for more possibility
          when faced with the prospect of reading the future should keep
          <i>Red Tarot</i> with them. I know that it will be very dear to me.
          <i>Red Tarot </i>shows you how to find a sense of almost unnerving
          freedom in the future. This book treats reading as a medicine.”<br />—Alice
          Sparkly Kat, author of <i>Postcolonial Astrology</i><br /><br />“After
          a pandemic’s collective deadness, I’m looking for resources that help
          us all claim collective aliveness. You’re holding one of the finest
          contributions to help find a portal to Eros; the rapture of aliveness,
          and the transcendent support of red reading. Christopher Marmolejo’s
          <i>Red Tarot</i> is an invaluable, extensively researched tool that
          helps you remember the language, symbols, and fields of somatic and
          intuitive knowledge acquisition. It’s a highly integrative work;
          successfully, accessibly merging the best of Christopher’s teachers in
          the decolonial and divinatory fields. <i>Red Tarot</i> achieves the
          work’s goal of Indigenous reclamation, reimagining, and regeneration
          in this pivotal time.”<br />—Colin Bedell, astrologer and founder of
          QueerCosmos

          radical community healing and building. They bring&nbsp;traditional
          teaching experience as an English teacher, intensive study as an
          astrologer, and their personal articulation of the tarot archetypes to
          their&nbsp;classes, workshops, and consultations as they seek to

          programs with the Center for Community Action and Environmental
          Justice for the Inland Empire, and has worked with the organization
