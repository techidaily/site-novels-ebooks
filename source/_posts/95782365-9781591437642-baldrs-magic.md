          A guide to using ecstatic trance to connect with your ancestors,
          rediscover your extrasensory powers, and reclaim the peaceful nature
          of humanity <br />
          <br />• Illustrates ecstatic trance postures to connect with the
          ancient Nordic people, to journey to exact points in time, and to
          access powers such as seeing into our future <br />
          <br />• Explains how the coming new age of peace and veneration for
          Mother Earth was predicted in Norse mythology as the rebirth of the
          compassionate god Baldr <br />
          <br />• Expands on the stories of the early Nordic gods and goddesses
          from the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda <br />
          <br />Connecting Norse mythology, ecstatic trance, the Universal Mind,
          and the dawn of a new age of peace and veneration for Mother Earth,
          Nicholas Brink reveals how we can use ecstatic and hypnotic trance to
          learn more directly and deeply from our distant ancestors, rediscover
          our extrasensory powers, and reclaim the original magical nature of
          humanity. The imminent rebirth of a peaceful, balanced, connected
          world was predicted in Norse mythology as the return of Baldr, the
          gentle and compassionate Nordic god of truth, healing, and rune work.
          <br />
          <br />Illustrating ecstatic trance postures to connect with the
          ancient Nordic people and their beliefs, to journey to exact points in
          time, and to access specific powers, such as seeing into our future,
          Brink explores humanity’s evolving cycle of consciousness from the era
          when the Great Mother goddess was the center of life through the
          transition to the worship of power and physical strength in the Bronze
          Age and the world of the Vikings. He explores the coming return of
          Baldr and the imminent new age of peace and respect for the earth.
          Through hypnotic divination, the author expands the stories of the
          early Nordic gods and goddesses from the Prose Edda and the Poetic
          Edda, in particular the fertility deities of the Vanir, such as Freyr,
          Freyja, and Idunn, who came before the warrior deities of the Æsir,
          such as Odin, Thor, and Loki. He details the epic battle of Ragnarǫk
          and the birth, life, death, and rebirth of Baldr. <br />
          <br />Brink shows how these ancient stories happen outside of time, in
          the past, present, and future, thus Baldr’s return is replayed in our
          death-rebirth experiences of life, in each dawn, with each spring, and
          now with the birth of a new age that we see happening all around us.
          Through the power of trance at this time of rebirth, we move full
          circle to reclaim the magic of the earliest times, the times of the
          Garden of Idunn.

          “This book is a lively combination of ancestral imagination,
          mythology, and historical reality. The author introduces a series of
          ecstatic trance postures that have been identified elsewhere as having
          ancient use for facilitating a variety of meditative inquiries and are
          frequently represented by some of the earliest known sacred figurines
          from around the world. The author, as he should, leaves the reader to
          form his or her own opinion as to the degree to which the story can be
          taken literally or as metaphor, as reality or imaginal fantasy, as
          personal or collective. Either way, James Hillman suggested that
          imagination and soul are fundamentally the same thing, and in that
          sense this book is a soul-focused journey into some of the long-ago
          roots of modern civilization.”
