            Imagine, for a moment, a branch in the wind. If it moves with the
            wind, it will sway gracefully and remain intact; but if it refuses
            to bend, it will break. Like that unbendable branch, many of us
            refuse to be in harmony with the changes around us, and it is out of
            this conflict that much of our stress is created.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with most emotions, stress is a natural part of life, but it must
            be carefully managed in order to keep a sense of balance. When we
            allow stress to take control, a number of psychological and physical
            health problems can follow. Anxiety, depression, headaches, high
            blood pressure, heart problems, and even diabetes can all be caused
            or exacerbated by stress. In order to live a healthy life, you need
            to make a change.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <strong>The Tao of Stress</strong>, an expert in Taoist
            psychology presents daily meditative skills and movement exercises
            that can help you simplify your life, fight fatigue, and calm a busy
            mind. After learning the basics of the Taoist approach to stress
            management, you will be able to put theory into practice through the
            various simple exercises and activities offered in this book. By
            creating your own stress management program, you will stay on the
            path (Tao) to good health, both in body and mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, even Zen masters aren’t immune to stress. But they do know
            that in order to break the cycle of stress, you must be willing to
            give yourself up to the flow of life. This book will show you how.

          “The words of Robert G. Santee’s The Tao of Stress are as clear as his
          obvious command of the philosophy, psychology, and practical
          application of Taoist principles for calming the ‘galloping mind’ and
          simplifying one’s life.”&nbsp;<br />—<strong>Ronald Zelman</strong>,
