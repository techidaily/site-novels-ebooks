          If things were to collapse, would you still know who you are? Would
          you know which way to turn if you suddenly felt betrayed by the
          company you worked for or by the leaders of your country? Do you feel
          empowered to make decisions for yourself, or do you rely on others for
          guidance? Each of us is conditioned to fit in, to strive for specific
          goals, to make life choices that our parents or society designated for
          us, rather than to understand and strive to live our uniqueness. And
          because we are in uncharted territory in these new times, which call
          for serious upgrades, it is essential to learn who you are, how to
          live as your unique self, and how to make decisions based on your own
          personalized inner GPS system -&nbsp;a powerful inner guidance system
          you probably don't even know you have. Are You a Mutant?&nbsp;breaks
          down a brand-new intel designated to assist you in uncovering a truth
          about yourself that is inevitably shocking. An insight that rings true
          like a mystical calling from your soul that simultaneously reveals all
          the places in your life you are living as a fake. In these changing
          times, we need all the upgrades we can get, and now it is time for an
          INNER WORLD UPGRADE, a new system of knowledge to support your
          understanding of the world we are currently wading through, its
          complexity, who you are within it, what makes you different, and how
          you can live the best strategy for your personal success,
          satisfaction, peace, and the wonderment of being alive.
