              >A practical guide for experiencing <i>natural awareness</i>—an
              effortless and spacious state of resting in the depth of our
              being.</b
            ><br />&nbsp;<br />Do you recall, as a child, being enthralled by a
            drifting cloud, a rain-soaked leaf, a wandering ladybug? Or suddenly
            having a sense of timelessness, contentment, and ease? If so, then
            you've already had a taste of <i>natural awareness</i>.<br />&nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />Known and revered in many traditions as a
            complement to focused mindfulness training, natural awareness
            transcends even these wondrous childhood moments. Some describe it
            as a profound “awareness of awareness”—an effortless, boundless
            state of resting in the depth of our being.<br /><br />For those new
            to meditation and experienced meditators alike, these 72
            “mini-chapters” guide you on an in-depth odyssey into natural
            awareness, illuminated by many simple and enjoyable insights and
            exercises. <i>The Little Book of Being</i> invites you to explore:
            The spectrum of awareness practices, from focused mindfulness to
            flexible mindfulness to natural awarenessHow classical mindfulness
            and effortless natural awareness enrich and shape each other, and
            how to practice bothThree ways to move into natural awareness—<i
              >relaxing effort, broadening awareness</i
            >, and <i>dropping objects</i>A treasury of “glimpse practices” to
            spark natural awareness anytime, in just a few momentsHow to bring
            this way of “simply being” into your daily life, into your
            connection with others, and into the world<i
              >“At first natural awareness may seem far away, just a whisper,
              but then it will begin to grow and expand and permeate aspects of
              living. Over time we may feel more peace, more connection to
              ourselves. We may find ourselves taking life a bit more lightly.
              We may feel a sense of relaxed ‘beingness’ throughout the day, and
              when we do get caught in our dramas, we may find ourselves moving
              out of them quicker than we imagined we could.” —</i
