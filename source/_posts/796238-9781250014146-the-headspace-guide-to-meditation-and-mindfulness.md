            As a former Buddhist monk with over 10 years of teaching experience,
            Andy Puddicombe has been acknowledged as the UK's foremost
            mindfulness meditation expert. Like his readers and students, he
            began his own meditation practice as a normal, busy person with
            everyday concerns, and he has since designed a program of
            mindfulness and guided meditation that fits neatly into a jam-packed
            daily routine-proving that just 10 minutes a day can make a world of
            difference. Simple exercises, stories and techniques culled from
            Andy's years of experience will help anyone calm the chatter in
            their minds. The result? More headspace, less stress. <br /><br /><i
              >Get Some Headspace </i
            >also brings us the extraordinary science behind this seemingly
            simple cure-all. This book and practice will help readers positively
            impact every area of their physical and mental health through
            mindfulness, from productivity and focus, to stress and anxiety
            relief, sleep, weight-loss, personal relationships...and the list
            goes on and on.

          “[Puddicombe] teaches techniques that can be practiced on a crowded
          subway or even while wolfing a sandwich during a quick lunch break at
          your desk.... Ed Halliwell [<i>The Guardian</i>] said Mr. Puddicombe
          is 'doing for meditation what someone like Jamie Oliver has done for
          food.' And like Mr. Oliver, he's ready to conquer the United States.”
          —<i>The New York Times</i><br /><br />“The expert's expert.” —<i
            >The Times (UK)</i
          ><br /><br />“There is definitely no religion, and nothing
          touchy-feely about the [Headspace] workshop… By the end of the day,
          with the online resources for support, I feel equipped to join the
          ranks of those who make daily meditation part of their busy lives.”

          <i>Sunday Times Style</i>'s amazing new meditation guru.” —<i

          ><br /><br />“Andy bubbles over with enthusiasm and is so easy to
          follow that most of us leave convinced and with every intention of an
          attempt to sustain our relaxed/alert state.” —<i
            >Easy Living Magazine</i
          ><br /><br />“Mindfulness is a hot topic in neuroscience. I consider
          the techniques in this book essential for maintaining a healthy brain
          and a happy mind. Andy is living proof that the ancient practice of
          mindfulness benefits modern day living.” —<i
