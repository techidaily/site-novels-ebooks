          Journal for Star Wisdom 2017 includes articles of interest concerning
          star wisdom (Astrosophy), as well as a guide to the correspondences
          between stellar configurations during the life of Christ and those of
          today. This guide comprises a complete sidereal ephemeris and
          aspectarian, geocentric and heliocentric, for each day throughout the
          year. Published yearly, new editions are available beginning in
          October or November for the coming new year.According to Rudolf
          Steiner, every step taken by Christ during his ministry between his
          baptism in the Jordan and the Resurrection was in harmony withand an
          expression ofthe cosmos. Journal for Star Wisdom is concerned with
          these heavenly correspondences during the life of Christ. It is
          intended to help provide a foundation for cosmic Christianity, the
          cosmic dimension of Christianity. It is this dimension that has been
          missing from Christianity in its two-thousand-year history. Readers
          can begin on this path by contemplating the movements of the Sun,
          Moon, and planets against the background of the zodiacal
          constellations (sidereal signs) today in relation to corresponding
          stellar events during the life of Christ. In this way, the possibility
          is opened for attuning, in a living way, to the life of Christ in the
          etheric cosmos.This year's journal begins with Robert Powell's article
          on the Jupiter rhythm underlying Christ's descent through the Earth's
          subearthly spheres, opening the path to Shambhala, the new paradise.
          Next is an article by Estelle Isaacson on the Earth Mother indwelling
          the golden realm of Shambhala, the heart of Mother Earth. Claudia
          McLaren Lainson's first article is "The Sun Chronicle in the Life of
          Jesus Christ," followed by "The Sabbath Door: The Truth Shall Set Us
          Free." Nicholas Kollerstrom contributed an article on the chart of the
          Resurrection of Jesus Christto which Robert Powell added an addendum.
          Julie Humphreys' article is "Awaking to the Ideals of Truth," taking
          fresh approaches to the theme of truth addressed by Claudia McLaren
          Lainson, whose third article is "The Sphere of Mars and Gautama's
          Heavenly Deed." Estelle Isaacson's second article, "The Archangel
          Michael and the Double of Humanity," follows. Claudia McLaren Lainson
          also contributed the article "Behold, We are to Make all Things New,"
          which introduces her monthly commentaries for 2017.The monthly
          commentaries are supported by monthly astronomical previews by Claudia
          McLaren Lainson, offering opportunities to observe and experience the
          stellar configurations physically during 2017. Direct interaction
          between us on Earth and the heavenly beings of the stars develops our
          capacity to receive their wisdom-filled teachings.
