          <b>Praise for THE ARTIST'S WAY.</b>..<br /><br />“<b
            >THE ARTIST’S WAY</b
          >
          by Julia Cameron is not exclusively about writing—it is about
          discovering and developing the artist within whether a painter, poet,
          screenwriter or musician—but it is a <i>lot</i> about writing. If you
          have always wanted to pursue a creative dream, have always wanted to
          play and create with words or paints, this book will gently get you
          started and help you learn all kinds of paying-attention techniques;
          and that, after all, is what being an artist is all about. It’s about
          learning to pay attention.”<br /><b>--Anne Lamott, Mademoiselle</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“The premise of the book is that creativity and
          spirituality are the same thing, they come from the same place. And we
          were created to use this life to express our individuality, and that
          over the course of a lifetime that gets beaten out of us. [<b
            >THE ARTIST’S WAY</b
          >] helped me put aside my fear and not worry about whether the record
          would be commercial.”<br /><b
            >--Grammy award-winning singer Kathy Mattea</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Julia Cameron brings creativity and spirituality
          together with the same kind of step-by-step wisdom that Edgar Cayce
          encouraged. The result is spiritual creativity as a consistent and
          nourishing part of daily life.”<br /><b>--Venture Inward</b
          ><br /><br />“I never knew I was a visual artist until I read Julia
          Cameron’s <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY</b>.”<br /><b
            >--Jannene Behl in Artist’s Magazine</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Julia Cameron’s landmark book
          <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY</b> helped me figure out who I really was as an
          adult, not so much as an artist but as a person. And award-winning
          journalist and poet, Cameron’s genius is that she doesn’t tell readers
          what they should do to achieve or who they should be—instead she
          creates a map for readers to start exploring these questions
          themselves.”<br /><b>--Michael F. Melcher, Law Practice magazine</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“This is not a self-help book in the normative
          sense. It is simply a powerful book that can challenge one to move
          into an entirely different state of personal expression and
          growth.”<br /><b>--Nick Maddox, Deland Beacon</b><br />&nbsp;<br />“<b
            >THE ARTIST’S WAY</b
          >
          (with its companion volume
          <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY MORNING PAGES JOURNAL</b>) becomes a friend over
          time, not just a journal. Like a journal, it provokes spontaneous
          insights and solutions; beyond journaling, it establishes a process
          that is interactive and dynamic.”<br /><b
            >--Theresa L. Crenshaw, M.D., San Diego Union-Tribune</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;“If you really want to supercharge your
          writing, I recommend that you get a copy of Julia Cameron’s book
          <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY</b>. I’m not a big fan of self-help books, but
          this book has changed my life for the better and restored my
          previously lagging creativity.”<br /><b
            >--Jeffrey Bairstow, Laser Focus World</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Working with the principle that creative
          expression is the natural direction of life, Cameron developed a three
          month program to recover creativity. <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY</b> shows how
          to tap into the higher power that connects human creativity and the
          creative energies of the universe.”<br /><b
            >--Mike Gossie, Scottsdale Tribune</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“<b>THE ARTIST’S WAY </b>is the seminal book on the
          subject of creativity and an invaluable guide to living the artistic
          life. Still as vital today—or perhaps even more so—than it was when it
          was first published in 1992, it is a provocative and inspiring work.
          Updated and expanded, it reframes <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY</b> for a new
          century.”<br /><b>--Branches of Light</b><br />&nbsp;<br />“THE
          ARTIST’S WAY has sold over 3 million copies since its publication in
          1992. Cameron still teaches it because there is sustained demand for
          its thoughtful, spiritual approach to unblocking and nurturing
          creativity. It is, dare we say, timeless.”<br /><b
            >--Nancy Colasurdo, FOXBusiness</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><b
            >Praise for VEIN OF GOLD, the second volume in the ARTIST’S WAY
            trilogy</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“For those seeking the wellspring of creativity,
          this book, like its predecessor, is a solid gold diving rod.”<br /><b
            >--PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</b
          ><br /><br /><br /><b>Praise for ARTISTS WAY EVERY DAY</b
          >…<br />&nbsp;<br />“I’ve been a huge fan of Julia Cameron’s work
          since I first delved into <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY</b> over a decade ago.
          Since then she’s continued to create a series of inspirational books,
          the latest of which is <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY EVERY DAY</b>, a wonderful
          collection of meditations and daily inspiration. A great addition to
          any collection of meditation and inspirational materials, Ms.
          Cameron’s new offering is sure to guide you in a new direction.”<br /><b
            >--Dishmag.com</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Now, Cameron’s most vital work is accessible in a
          daily guide. Intended for study for the course of a year,
          <b>THE ARTIST’S WAY EVERY DAY</b> extracts the essential teachings
          from Cameron’s groundbreaking work and assigns them to each of the 365
          days.”<br /><b>--Business Woman</b>
