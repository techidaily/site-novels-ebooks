          Across thousands of years, people have described one of the most
          astonishing of all human phenomena: the near-death experience (NDE),
          the subjective experience of an Afterlife, a place where we apparently
          survive death. The more powerful the NDE, the more profound the after
          effects. The ambitious reset their priorities. Atheists change their
          values. Doctors rethink their beliefs. But what if the after effects
          of an NDE were undeniable? What if someone suddenly developed the
          ability to produce high quality paintings of their NDE, a new-found
          skill that went far beyond the artistic ability they had before? And
          what if that same person then suddenly acquired the ability to compose
          classical symphonies after their NDE? And their symphonies were then
          premiered at sell out orchestral concerts, even though, to this day,
          they are unable to read or write a single note of musical notation.
          Wouldn't this be proof that even a cynic would have a hard time
          explaining? After his NDE, this is exactly what happened to David. And
          this is his story.

          Shine on is one of the most gripping accounts of a near-death
          experience that I have read. And I say that having interviewed, since
          1965, thousands of people who described such experiences. David's
          story also evokes...a primal horror of being dragged under and run
          over by a train. I still remember the chill that went down my spine...

        <p>
          In 2006 David Ditchfield was dragged under a speeding train in a freak
          accident. As the surgeons fought to save him, he had a profound
          near-death experience (NDE). When he woke up in hospital, he had
          acquired astonishing new abilities. He found he could paint dramatic
          paintings of what he had seen in the Afterlife, far beyond any
          artistic ability he had before. He then discovered he could compose
          classical music, having never received any training. To this day, he
          cannot read or write a single note of musical notation, and yet his
          debut NDE-inspired symphony, The Divine Light, was premiered at a
          sell-out orchestral concert to a standing ovation. He lives, paints
          and composes in a converted riverside mill near Cambridge, UK. J S
          Jones gained her PhD from the University of Stirling and has since
          authored a number of scientific journal articles. She has been friends
          with David Ditchfield for many years and witnessed the events in his
          remarkable story first-hand. Impressed by what she saw, she undertook
          creative writing courses so that she could co-author Shine On and do
          his story justice, because she believes it is a remarkable story that
          deserves to be told. She is now working on a debut fiction novel. She
          lives in Fife, Scotland.
