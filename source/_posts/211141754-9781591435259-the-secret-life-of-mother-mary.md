          • Explores obscured periods of Mary’s life, including her time as
          leader of the Christian community and as the spiritual teacher to
          Jesus and Mary Magdalene<br /><br />• Examines Mary’s high-level
          powers, which enabled the divine conception of Jesus, his
          resurrection, and Mary’s assumption into heaven<br /><br />• Shows how
          nurturing a relationship with Mother Mary can provide healing,
          empowerment, and the development of your own womb powers<br /><br />Many
          women have trouble with the image of the Virgin Mary, a young woman
          whose most esteemed quality has been celibacy. Yet, as Marguerite Mary
          Rigoglioso, Ph.D., reveals in inspiring depth, Mary was not just a
          docile maiden chosen by God to be the mother of Jesus. She was a great
          spiritual master in her own right: a sought-after healer and holy
          priestess who continued her public work long after Jesus’s
          resurrection.<br /><br />Examining apocryphal texts as well as
          revelations from respected contemporary seers, Rigoglioso presents an
          extraordinary new understanding of Mother Mary and shows how her
          wisdom can help those on the spiritual path. The author explores
          largely ignored periods of Mary’s life, including her time as leader
          of the early Christian community and the supreme teacher to other
          spiritual teachers, among them Jesus and his beloved companion, Mary
          Magdalene. She looks at Mother Mary’s teachings of love, compassion,
          and inner power and reveals how it was her achievement of remarkable
          yogic powers and womb abilities that enabled her to conceive Jesus in
          a highly advanced way and resurrect his body. She also examines Mary’s
          assumption into heaven and explains how her powers as a great
          spiritual master enabled her to transform into a goddess at the end of
          her time on earth.<br /><br />Revealing the secret life of Mother Mary
          as a deeply revered community leader, miracle-worker, and advanced
          spiritual practitioner, Rigoglioso shows how nurturing a relationship
          with the world’s most famous holy woman can provide healing,
          empowerment, and the development of your own womb powers.
