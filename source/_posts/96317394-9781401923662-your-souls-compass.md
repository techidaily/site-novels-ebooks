          &nbsp;<br />
          In this time of global change and uncertainty, of spiritual
          indirection, Americans are asking these age-old questions with renewed
          curiosity. There’s a thirst for meaning and purpose—a dawning
          realization that happiness isn’t a commodity that can be bought with a
          gold card. Fulfillment and joy arise naturally from creative and
          compassionate action—from the understanding that all life is
          interconnected and guided by a higher intelligence. Our personal
          choices make a difference, and when they are spiritually inspired even
          the smallest action serves a larger whole.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Sacred texts ranging from the Torah to the New Testament, the Tao Te
          Ching to the Buddhist scriptures, the Vedantas to the Koran, speak of
          making life-enhancing choices where a force greater than the
          individual flows through us and informs our thoughts and actions. In
          this book we’ll focus on the three classic aspects of living such a
          spiritually guided life: (1) alignment: maintaining a direct and
          personal connection to the Source of our Being; (2) discernment:
          distinguishing the movement of Spirit in our lives from our own wants,
          fears and social conditioning; and (3) action: making our best, most
          inspired contribution to the evolution of life.

          “An elegant, simple, and practical guide to get in touch with your
          higher self and experience the field of infinite possibilities.”<br /><b
            >— Deepak Chopra</b
          >, the author of&nbsp;<i>Buddha: A Story of Enlightenment</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Your Soul’s Compass&nbsp;</i>by Joan Borysenko and
          Gordon Dveirin refreshingly challenges the ‘light unto ourselves’
          sensibilities of much of the modern spiritual marketplace. It points
          us all to the simple truth that direction from an intelligence greater
          than our own ego is critical for authentic spiritual evolution. The
          book’s greatest message is that not only do we have to open ourselves
          to the experience of direct revelation, but even more important, if we
          want our world in crisis to change, we must have the courage to act on
          what is revealed to us.”<br /><b>— Andrew Cohen</b>, the founder of
          EnlightenNext and&nbsp;<i>What Is Enlightenment?</i
          >magazine<br /><br />“<i>Your Soul’s Compass&nbsp;</i>is a treasure—a
          book that will change the way you move through your life. Beautiful
          and provocative, it explores in completely original ways the most
          important questions: How do you lead a life that’s guided by love? How
          can you distinguish between authentic guidance and the desires of the
          ego? How can lead-ers as radically opposed as Hitler and Gandhi both
          feel they’re being divinely inspired? Simple yet profound, pragmatic
          and transforming, this is a book you’ll want to reread and keep close
          at hand.”<br /><b>— Sara Davidson</b>, the author
          of&nbsp;<i>Leap!&nbsp;</i>and<i>&nbsp;Loose Change<br /></i
          ><br />“Surely no journey is more promising, yet more problematic,
          than the journey into our own hearts. In this marvelous and insightful
          book, Joan and Gordon have done us the immense service of distilling
          the guidance of 27 sages from a wide array of spiritual lineages. A
          delicious feast awaits the reader—a true pleasure to partake!”<br /><b
            >— William Ury</b
          >, the author of&nbsp;<i>The Power of a Positive No</i><br /><br />“As
          a Christian, my beliefs in God and the consciousness that we’re all
          spiritual beings yearning for a deeper connection to our Source draws
          me into this mind-expanding book. The convictions of 27 sages sharing
          their insights on the spiritual journey and our soul’s maturation
          gives us clarifying revelations into our understanding and imagination
          of how you and I can draw closer to God.”<br />— entertainer&nbsp;<b
            >Naomi Judd</b
          ><br /><br />“This book is such a gift to the world! It makes a
          significant contribution by launching the first real interfaith
          dialogue on identify-ing what spiritual guidance is and perceiving the
          potential it has in helping the world in its evolution toward greater
          compassion.”<br /><b>— Reverend Dr. Ruth&nbsp;Ragovin</b>
