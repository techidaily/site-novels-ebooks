            <i>Intention</i> is the seed of all change and it is the creative
            power that fulfils our dreams. An intention contains the DNA of
            manifestation and it is therefore the key to creating the life you
            want. Our outer world is a reflection of our inner world, and so the
            only way to shift reality is to start with what is inside us.<br /><br />According
            to research, 92% of new year resolutions fail by the end of the
            year. The only way to reverse this trend is to go deeper.<br /><br />This
            powerful book guides you through a process of practical self-enquiry
            that gets to the true heart of your intentions for this life. You
            will weed out the obstacles in the way of your wishes, such as
            limiting self-beliefs and the stories you currently tell about
            yourself. You will plant the seeds of intention with a sense of true
            clarity and infinite possibility, and then water them with your
            daily actions and care. And then all that needs to be done is to
            trust in the outcome and allow your intentions to grow.<br /><br /><i
              >Intention</i
            >
            is for anyone who wishes to align their life with their innermost
            wishes and tap into the most underrated power in the universe.<br /><br /><b

            ><br />"It is a joy to find a life-changing book that is so clearly
            and beautifully written. Andrew Wallas distils decades of clinical
            practice with wisdom and a deceptively light touch. The overall
            message is strong. We are each responsible for our own path to
            happiness, and <i>Intention </i>is the inspiring guidebook that can
            help us to find it."
            <b>- Georgia Coleridge, author of <i>The Chakra Project </i></b
            ><br /><br /><b>PRAISE FOR ANDREW WALLAS:</b><br />"Intention is a
            superpower which when used correctly aligns us to our purpose and
            helps fulfil our heart's work. Andrew Wallas elegantly and
            generously shows us how. His approach is simple, yet it is not easy
            - but boy is it worth it." Emma Cannon, fertility and women's health
            expert, acupuncturist and author of <i>Fertile </i><br />"Andrew
            holds the space for you to reconnect with your inner wisdom. His
            skill is that he is intuitive but practical."

            "spiritual" healers, guides and psychics over the years. However,
            none of them have managed to explain to me in terms that I
            understand how I can effectively blend the real or human world with
            this spiritual calling that I feel. I believe that I have found in
            you my guru / teacher that can really help me navigate this exciting

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Andrew Wallas (Author) </b><br />
          Andrew Wallas, has been described by the <i>Daily Mail</i> as a
          'Modern Day Wizard' who 'transforms your energy', creating 'alchemical
          shift'. He has been successful in an outer world sense - creating
          significant wealth in the City - but was ahead of the curve in
          realizing 32 years ago that wealth is not money, it is happiness. His
          aim is to impart the message that if we leave the outside world alone
          for a while and concentrate on our inner world, our outer world will
          reflect any internal shift we make.<br /><br />Andrew started his
          working life in the City, where in 10 years he became extremely
          successful in Finance. By his late twenties, he realised that the
          rapid growth in outer financial success was correlated with a sense of
          inner meaninglessness and loneliness. After a breakdown/ breakthrough,
          Andrew left the City and spent four years studying at Theological
          College, obtaining degrees in both theology and philosophy and
          subsequently gained a master's degree in psychology. Following several
          trainings in psychotherapy, he opened a thriving clinical practice in
          North London, working with individuals and groups.<br /><br />
