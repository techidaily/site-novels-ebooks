            Emotional Freedom Therapy or (EFT) is a remarkable technique that
            alleviates emotional distress using simple yet elegant techniques
            based on the body's energy meridians. By teaching an easily adopted
            system of tapping on the body’s meridian points, ENJOY EMOTIONAL
            FREEDOM enables you to ‘tune’ and ‘tone’ your body’s energy system
            for immediate relaxation and relief from stress and anxiety. EFT is
            one of the few techniques that ordinary people can use to gain some
            control over dysfunctional feelings. ENJOY EMOTIONAL FREEDOM is full
            of deceptively simple yet highly effective tips and strategies that
            guide you into ways of being better balanced and more emotionally
            ‘fit’, regardless of any negative thinking you might be saddled with
            at present. Let the authors give you the life-long gift of emotional
            freedom.

            This is a little book about a big subject. It represents the fruit
            of a decade of experimentation and innovation in the field of energy
            psychology by two of the most enthusiastic and original
            contributors. In a nutshell the techniques taught in this book allow
            someone to ‘tune’ and ‘tone’ their body’s energy system for the
            immediate benefit of relaxation and a reduction of the body’s stress
            responses. They can also learn how to apply the meridian energy
            stimulation directly to a number of emotional issues with
            predictable positive results: typically, these are the issues of
            fear, anxiety and hurt.

            There are very, very few techniques that ordinary people can use
            alone to gain some control over dysfunctional feelings – and the
            techniques in this book represent two of them. The SET technique is
            a body technique—not really a mental one. It does have a great
            effect on the thoughts over time but not necessarily a direct one.
            The feeling that hurts us is ‘stuck’ in the body. This is where the
            change (processing of emotion) will occur. You know you have a
            problem because when you think of something you have unpleasant
            feeling-reactions. If there is no ‘hot’ feeling when you think of a
            problem—then where is the problem?
          </p>
          <p>
            ENJOY EMOTIONAL FREEDOM enables and empowers the ordinary person to
            start getting results now, without having to be
            psychologically-minded or clever. It’s full of useful tips and
            strategies which can be deceptively simple. This book guides you
            into ways of being better balanced and more emotionally ‘fit’
            regardless of the thinking you might be saddled with at present.
            Best of all, it gives you the life-long gift of being able to help
            yourself far more than you ever imagined.
