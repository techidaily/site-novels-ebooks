          In this powerful book, Steffany Barton, RN, documents her decades long
          journey to understanding and embracing the valuable lessons offered in
          life after suicide. With personal passion and professional integrity,
          Steffany carefully listens to the voices of departed souls and
          compassionately speaks to those left behind, building a bridge of
          timeless love between heaven and earth. Those who commit suicide

          where their souls dwell on the Other Side. "Facing Darkness, Finding
          Light" provides insight into the afterlife of those who commit
          suicide, sheds the light on healing in life after suicide, and shares
          meaningful techniques for forging new bonds between the departed and
          those left behind. Though the journey begins in the darkness of death,
          there is hope, there is light. Find it in this truly exceptional book.

          "Barton tells us that she is an accidental medium. In her teen years,
          she lost a close friend to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Because of
          the residual effects of the suicide of her friend, she eventually
          discovered what she calls the 'broadcast band on the Heavenly radio
          dial'. The result was that she left her job as a registered nurse to
          become a 'nurse for the soul'. As more and more people arrived to ask
          her to talk to their loved ones on the other side, she also began
          hearing, unprompted, from many souls who had taken their own lives.
          They were asking her to tell people on the physical plane that they
          were at peace, that they were 'back home'. Highly compelling and
          bittersweet, this story tugs on the heartstrings as it instills wisdom
          which the world as a whole is greatly in need of. Barton writes with
          passion and the emotional impact of her words propel the reader
          forward through the book and into connection with the dual world in
          which she lives and works. Suicide leaves behind many people filled
          with guilt and pain. The common wisdom says that it is an act of anger
          meant to damage others. From the other side there are now voices
          setting the record straight and bringing great comfort to loved ones
          left behind. One of their key messages forms the foundation for this
          book: 'A suicide that is committed is a suicide that could not have
          been prevented'.‚Äù
