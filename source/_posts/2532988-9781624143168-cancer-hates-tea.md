            <b>Drink Tea to Tell Cancer ‘Hit the Road’ </b><br /><br />Become a
            tea lover with a purpose and help your body defend itself against
            cancer. Learn to embrace tea in all its varieties— green, white,
            black, pu-erh, herbal and more—as both a mental and physical
            experience to protect your health. Discover the history, growing
            information and health implications of each variety, as well as
            uniquely delicious methods to boost your intake with serving
            suggestions, food pairings and recipes that highlight the benefits
            of tea.<br /><br />After her own battle with cancer, Maria Uspenski
            extensively researched tea and discovered hundreds of studies that
            showed how powerful a five-cup-a-day (1.2 L) steeping habit could
            be. Tea is the most studied anti-cancer plant, with over 5,000
            medical studies published on its health benefits over the past 10
            years. By breaking down how tea works with your body’s defenses
            against cancer in a lighthearted tone, Maria’s serious research is
            approachable and relatable for anyone who is battling the disease or
            for family and friends of those fighting cancer. Start harnessing
            the wellness-promoting properties of tea and see your life change
            with an easy-to-follow three-week plan that gets tea polyphenols
            streaming through your system 24/7.
