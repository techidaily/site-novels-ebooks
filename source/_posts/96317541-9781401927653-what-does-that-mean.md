            >Enlightenment is not something that can just be handed to you. The
            closest thing to it that you can receive are thoughts and questions
            that can lead you inward in the search for meaning.
            <i>What Does That Mean?</i> is full of thoughts and questions that
            do just that. <br /></b
          ><br />Some insights you may have thought of and then forgotten, and
          others you may have experienced but simply haven’t appreciated. An old
          saying asserts that the value of a book is not in what it says but
          rather in what it does. <i>What Does That Mean?</i> is one of those
          books that will have a lifetime impact on all who read it.
          <br /><br />The book squarely faces the many inconsistencies held in
          our systems of belief, from the sciences to psychic phenomena. Eldon
          Taylor is willing to speak out without reservation, and without
          avoiding any so-called sanctities. The result is absolutely
          thought-provoking at every level, as this work addresses the meaning
          of life and the ultimate "humanness" of the human being. If you have
          ever questioned the nature of life, the power of the mind, unexplained
          events, and other mysteries, you will find this book totally riveting.
          <br /><br />Throughout these pages, Eldon shares life experiences that
          will lead you to revelations about your own life. Perhaps this book’s
          greatest value is that it assists you in remembering who you really
          are and thereby places you firmly back on the path to personal
          enlightenment. <br /><br />English writer and poet Joseph Addison,
          said, "Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body." If that
          is the case, then this book is the perfect workout to enrich your
          thinking. You may not always like what you read, but you will always
          find the depth of thought wholly provocative.
