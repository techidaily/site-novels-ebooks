            Betrayal in all its forms has been and is an ever present reality in
            every area of life--politics, business, and human relationships to
            name a few. Recent publications have chronicled the unethical
            actions of mental health and other human service professionals, yet
            the psychology of betrayal has received little public interest and
            attention. This book explores the many issues relating to
            psychotherapy and betrayal. The contributing authors of Betrayal in
            Psychotherapy and its Antidotes present the various faces of
            betrayal as may be encountered by therapists in the office or in the
            profession. They challenge therapists to understand the violations
            of trust that can occur within the therapeutic relationship. Readers
            are reminded that the trauma of betrayal manifests itself within all
            patients, regardless of of the nature and expression of
            psychopathology. More importantly, the authors define betrayal as
            experienced with specific cases and they attempt to bring out
            underlying principles that are useful to therapists and the larger
            professional community.Readers will find their understanding of the
            concept of betrayal much expanded from the chapters in Betrayal in
            Psychotherapy and its Antidotes. For example, betrayal is discussed
            as a failure in the interpersonal or inter-subjective relationship
            between therapist and client in one chapter as opposed to the
            concept of betrayal as an act calculated to lead another person
            astray, an act of deception or treachery, and a breach of confidence
            and trust as considered in another chapter. Other approaches to
            betrayal and psychotherapy include:

          examples to establish the importance of the therapist striving to
          remain true to the genuine potentiality of a patient how to avoid
          colluding with the patient’s rejection of life the work of Alice
          Miller, a psychoanalyst by training, and the betrayal of children by

          reliance upon moral reasoning an investigation on the link between
          therapists’personal maturity and the success of therapy how
          traditional humanistic and analytic therapies can entrap both
          therapist and patient into a betrayal of self and the relationship
