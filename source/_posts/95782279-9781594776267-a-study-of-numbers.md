          We lack direct consciousness of Space and Time. We can know of them
          only indirectly by mass, force, and energy, and by the intermediary of
          phenomena such as may be tested by our five senses. Without direct
          awareness of Space or Time, human beings lack two “senses” necessary
          for the knowledge of all causes. From this imperfection, of which we
          are always being made aware, is born our need to simplify. Thus we
          reduce everything to fundamental properties, without paying any
          attention to the underlying universal organization, the effects of
          which are all around us. <br />
          <br />The result is that the science of numbers, the most wonderful
          guide to the constant creation of the universe, remains an enormous
          hypothesis so long as its use has not awakened in us the higher
          consciousness of a universal order. By deepened knowledge of things
          and their process of becoming, we must come to recognize Numbers as a
          truth, and to experience with our senses the living relation of a
          cause to an effect, this relation being truer and more real than the
          effect could ever be. <br />
          <br />Published in 1917 under the author's given name of René
          Schwaller, <i>A Study of Numbers</i> is the first expression of the
          teachings we have come to associate with his later and better known
          name, R.A. Schwaller de Lubicz. It is a masterly account of the
          living, universal, qualitative, and casual reality of numbers. <br />
          <br />Starting from the irreducible one, Schwaller deals with the
          unfolding of creation through the cycles of polarization, ideation,
          and formation. Topics covered include: numbers, values, and relations;
          the disengagement of numbers; the harmonic basis of numbers; the
          development of values; and the establishment of harmony.

        </h4>
        <p>
          R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz (1887-1961) was one of the most important
          philosophers, mathematicians, and Egyptologists of this century. His
          elucidation of the temple at Luxor and his presentation of the
          Egyptian understanding of a special quality of innate consciousness
          form a bridge that links the sacred science of the Ancients to its
          rediscovery in our own time.
