            >“Singing is as human as breathing, and this book tells us why.”
            —Mark Guarino, contributing music writer, <i>The Guardian</i></b

            >Celebrated yogi-musician Girish opens new possibilities for
            transforming your life through song, combining the ancient art of
            singing mantra with twenty-first century neuroscience research.</b
          ><br /><br />For as long as he can remember, Girish has created rhythm
          to accompany life. His first experience of music as sacred art came in
          college, playing with jazz bands. “During improvisational sessions,”
          he recalls, “there were these unexplainable moments of synchronicity
          and intuition that felt like magic.” This led Girish to an unexpected
          journey—a seeming detour to live as a monk in an ashram for five years
          that inadvertently nourished his musical artistry. Here, he studied
          Sanskrit as a means to understand the deeper meanings of ancient
          chants, which sparked a life-changing event that led him back to
          music—and to combine music with Sanskrit chants. Now he shares what
          he’s learned to help people of all ages, backgrounds, and traditions
          to transform body, brain, and life through mantra and music.<br />
          <br />With <i>Music and Mantras</i>, Girish has created an interactive
          toolkit—including more than ninety minutes of companion audio
          material—for personal transformation through singing, sharing his own
          experience as a musician, yogi, and former Hindu monk. Weaving simple,
          elegant mantras from ancient traditions with neuroscience, Girish
          shows us how to achieve greater peace of mind, clarity, calm, focus,
          and even improved health and wealth through the yogic art of
          chanting—an ideal practice for singing our way to happiness, health,
          and prosperity.
