            <i>Infinite Possibilities</i> and <i>Life on Earth</i><br /><br /><i

            is a master class for creating the life you want to live. Tried and
            true, delivered and perfected over a decade while being shared live
            with tens of thousands of students in 132 cities, in 34 countries,
            upon 6 continents.</b
          ><br /><br />This&nbsp;is Mike Dooley’s advanced course on living
          deliberately and creating consciously. The concepts he shares were
          born of material he’s delivered to live audiences the world over,
          culminating in his most impactful, most transformational program ever.
          Now, for the first time in 17 years of touring, these ideas are to be
          shared in book form.<br />At the heart of the Matrix lies a simple yet
          <i>highly unexpected</i> concept for creating major life change that’s
          unlike anything shared by other teachers, past and present. It clearly
          reveals why “manifesting” <i>sometimes</i> works with incredible ease,
          why it sometimes doesn’t work at all, and why, on occasion, it works,
          and yet in hindsight we wish it hadn’t. Readers will not only learn
          about the “Bermuda Triangle of Manifesting” that too often leads to
          heartbreak and loss, they’ll learn how to navigate around it, under
          full sail, with their own new “a-ha” moments that will teach them:<br />•
          How to achieve clarity in purpose and desire and thereby avoid
          contradictions and self-sabotage<br />• How to fuel their dreams with
          passion while not attaching to unimportant details and outcomes<br />•
          How to plan and take action on their dreams without “messing with the
          cursed how’s”!<br />And so much more...
