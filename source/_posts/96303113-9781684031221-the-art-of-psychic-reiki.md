              guide for learning the sacred art of Reiki while cultivating the

          <p>
            Reiki is a gentle yet powerful, hands-on&nbsp;energy healing method
            from Japan that’s been gaining in popularity over the last
            century—not only with bodyworkers and massage therapists in the
            West&nbsp;but also with medical professionals who can attest to its
            healing power. Born from the author’s decades of experience with
            Reiki healing and her own methods,
            <i>The Art of Psychic Reiki </i>provides everything you need to know
            about this healing art, including the critical psychic development
            and empathy training that prepares healers to go out and do the work
            they were meant to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re drawn to the healing art of Reiki, you might be a highly
            sensitive person, with high levels of empathy, intuition, and latent
            psychic abilities (a combination of intuition and inner knowing,
            plus the ability to connect with higher wisdom). And since Reiki is
            a form of energy healing, many new practitioners may experience
            what’s called a psychic opening as they learn or practice. For this
            reason, it’s important that <i>every</i> Reiki practitioner master
            the ability to navigate their empathic and psychic sensitivities
            while engaged in this work—and this book can help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re new to Reiki or you’re a practitioner seeking to
            deepen your knowledge and enhance your skills, with this
            guide&nbsp;you’ll learn how to use Reiki to heal yourself and
            others, cultivate and trust your natural intuition, develop your
            empathic and psychic abilities, work with your spirit guides, and
            ground and protect yourself as a practitioner of this sacred healing
            art.
