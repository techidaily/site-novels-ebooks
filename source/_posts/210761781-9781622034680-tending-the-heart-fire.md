              >"We are created in rhythm, kept alive in rhythm, evolve through
              rhythm. Tides, breath, and blood flow in rhythm. We are born into
              a universe of currents, and our heart is the great conductor of
              the body, orchestrating our flow."</i
            ><br />The mystical foundations of all the world's spiritual paths
            meet in a single, sacred place: the heart of the seeker. We have
            reached a time when scientific understanding mirrors the teachings
            of the great wisdom traditions in revealing our energetic heart as
            the light of consciousness, the fire of love, a field of
            intelligence. <i>Tending the Heart Fire</i>, the first book by
            pioneering yogini Shiva Rea, is an invitation to embody our
            extraordinary potential at this turning point in time, to reconnect
            your life to the rhythms of your body and the natural world—to live
            in flow with the pulse of life.<br />Weaving together wisdom from
            the great world traditions—including yoga, Ayurveda, Tantra, and
            modern science—Shiva presents an essential resource for becoming a
            firekeeper of the sacred heart. This diverse treasury is filled with
            mediations, life guidance, seasonal rituals, and daily practices,
            including:<br /><br />Insights for harmonizing with the sacred
            junctures of time—the daily, weekly, lunar, and solar cycles of
            manifestation and renewalAligning with the seasons—how to adapt your
            diet, exercise, and yoga rhythms throughout the annual cycle Ways to
            honor the great sacred holidays, rites, and festivalsAwakening of
            <i>sahaja</i>—the natural flow at the origins and source of yoga
            asana and sacred embodiment at the heart of yoga and TantraSkills
            for tending your inner fire in every aspect of life and healing
            imbalances that can support a renewable energy lifestyleA visual
            teaching with over a hundred full-color images, including reference
            charts, diagrams, illustrations, and ancient poetry for
            inspiration<br />The legacy of the Heart Fire is more than eight
            hundred thousand years old—and in our modern world, we need more
            than ever to consciously reconnect to the radiant field that
            transcends time, space, and culture. "The direct awakening of the
            heart often happens when we are at a crisis point, when the armor of
            our heart has to crack," writes Shiva Rea. "Let us return to the
            power and magnificence of our hearts—as living fire, as intelligent
            energy and electromagnetic radiance, and as our illuminating guide
            toward love, creativity, and deep knowing of our true sacred
            nature."
