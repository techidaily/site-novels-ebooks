            Who has not had emotional rags over addiction or known someone that
            has experienced the emotional rags of addiction? If we were to
            change our thinking to possibly looking at the rags of addiction as
            a wake up call to something better, could it be easier to start
            addressing addiction and what we need to do to stop it? The only way
            to cure a mind altering addiction is to stop. But how? When? Can the
            emotional rags we have stuffed inside us for years be healed? Is it
            even possible? The answer always lives within us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Emotional Rags to Spiritual Riches is a rags to riches story. This
            is a true story with opportunity, hope, and proven examples from the
            author, who has stayed sober for 17 years and counting. David
            Stanley Gregory had many Emotional Rags to heal. He shares what it
            takes just to become willing. Addiction comes in many life styles
            and afflicts people from Yale to jail. He shares that we all have an
            addiction to something. His journey has shown him the opportunity
            that comes out of addiction, the wake up call, the life that is
            waiting for us. This is his story, your story, and the story of
            anyone wanting to be free of addictive compulsive behaviors. Because
            addiction takes on many faces and affects many lifestyles, it has a
            message for everyone. If this book is in your hands, there is no
            mistake: it is there for a reason. Go for it! Take your own rags to
            riches story and find out who you really are by learning to let go
            of what appears to be you. You will be amazed what is in store for
            you in the way of life's Spiritual Riches.
          </p>
