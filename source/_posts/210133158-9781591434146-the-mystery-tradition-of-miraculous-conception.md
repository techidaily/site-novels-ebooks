          • 2022 Nautilus Silver Award <br /><br />• Award Winner in the
          Spirituality: General category of the 2021 Best Book Awards sponsored
          by American Book Fest <br /><br />• Explains how Mary was born into a
          lineage of powerful women who cultivated and passed on the ability to
          consciously conceive elevated beings <br /><br />• Includes a complete
          translation of the <i>Infancy Gospel of James</i> and reveals the
          hidden codes it contains relating to the practice of miraculous
          conception <br /><br />• Shows how Mary was trained and initiated in
          the “womb mysteries” and reveals the esoteric techniques she used to
          conceive Jesus <br /><br />Delving into one of the Virgin Mary’s
          forgotten gospels, the <i>Infancy Gospel of James</i>, Marguerite Mary
          Rigoglioso, Ph.D., reveals a truth that has been suppressed for nearly
          two millennia: that Mother Mary was not a passive bystander to her own
          pregnancy but an advanced member of a sacred order of women trained in
          divine conception. <br /><br />Unlocking the hidden codes of Mary’s
          gospel and other ancient source texts, the author reveals how Mary
          conceived Jesus through a careful process that she willed and
          initiated. She explains how Mary was born into a family of powerful
          priestesses, women who possessed, cultivated, and passed on the
          ability to consciously conceive elevated beings to help the planet.
          This lineage included Mary’s own mother, Anne, who conceived Mary with
          this method, her relative Elizabeth (mother of John the Baptist), and
          the biblical matriarch Sarah, the wife of Abraham and mother of Isaac.
          These women were schooled in the shamanic “womb mysteries,” secret
          knowledge of the capacity of the womb. Decoding the
          <i>Infancy Gospel of James</i>, the author shows how Mary was trained
          and initiated, reveals the esoteric techniques she used to conceive
          Jesus, and explores the birth itself and the mind-altering reality
          that accompanied it. <br /><br />By revealing the Virgin Mary as a
          trained holy woman and a conscious actor in the conception of Jesus,
          the author corrects the impression we have been given of a passive and
          bewildered girl who had no idea how or why she was pregnant. She also
          restores Mary as the empowered feminine orchestrator of these
          significant events, paralleling the redemption of Mary Magdalene in
          recent years. Explaining how and why virgin birth was accomplished,
          this book allows us to make sense of miraculous conception and reveals
          the power that lies in all women’s wombs.

          “Marguerite Rigoglioso is a holy conduit who proclaims a message so
          timely, so graceful, and so filled with truth that my hands tremble as
          I pick up this book. It is about time the prestige and wisdom of
          Mother Mary are seen and acknowledged in the devastation of an
          institution that gave her nothing more than the appearance of a
          passive spectator. These pages are soaked with Her presence, offering
          us a generosity that comes freely and touches deeply. The Mystery
          Tradition of Miraculous Conception is a body of work that reveals the
          real Mary, one who lived before the church and sure as heaven shall
          live on after the church.”
