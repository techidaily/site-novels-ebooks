            There is no more inspiring a guide for coping in a complicated world
            than Jacob the Baker. His plainspoken wisdom and commonsense
            approach—delivered with compassion, humor, and understanding—provide
            nourishment for the soul. In his parables, Jacob ponders universal
            questions both profound and simple, and he offers hope, comfort, and
            direction in the midst of life’s daunting but sometimes wondrous
            challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confronting head-on the issues of love, grief, faith, and
            acceptance, Jacob speaks with us, not at us, about making peace with
            the past; about the importance of integrity, kindness, and honesty;
            about doing right rather than being right; and most of all, about
            finding inner peace. A lifetime in the writing, this book should be
            shared with loved ones and strangers like the invaluable gift it is.
            Keep it close in your life, as a gift to you.
