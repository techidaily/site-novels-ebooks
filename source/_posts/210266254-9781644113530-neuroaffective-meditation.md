          • Shares 16 guided meditations for neuroaffective brain development
          and emotional maturation, along with links to online recordings
          <br /><br />• Explores the stages of emotional development, from
          childhood to old age, and their potentials for developing new ways of
          functioning <br /><br />• Reveals the biopsychological effects of
          meditation on the human brain, including how it affects us at the
          autonomic, limbic, and prefrontal levels <br /><br />Drawing on her 25
          years of research into brain development as well as decades of
          meditation practice, psychotherapist Marianne Bentzen shows how
          neuroaffective meditation--the holistic integration of meditation,
          neuroscience, and psychology--can be used for personal growth and
          conscious maturation. She also explores how the practice can help
          address embedded traumas and allow access to the best perspectives of
          growing older while keeping the best psychological attitudes of being
          young--a hallmark of wisdom. She explains that there is a sequence to
          emotional maturation, just as there is for the development of
          cognitive or athletic skills, and details the central developmental
          processes of childhood and adolescence and the adult stages of
          psychological development. She then explores the biopsychological
          effects of meditation on the human brain, including how it affects us
          at the autonomic, limbic, and prefrontal levels. <br /><br />The
          author shares 16 guided meditations for neuroaffective brain
          development (along with links to online recordings), each designed to
          gently interact with the deep, unconscious layers of the brain and
          help you reconnect to yourself, your relationships, and the world
          around. Each meditation explores a different theme, from breathing in
          “being in your body” to feeling love, compassion, and gratitude in
          “the songs of the heart” to balancing positive and negative
          experiences in “mandala.” The author also shares a 5-part meditation
          centered on breathing exercises designed to balance your energy.
          <br /><br />Presenting an authentic, stepwise approach to spiritual
          growth, emotional maturation, and brain development, this guide
          explains the science behind neuroaffective meditation and offers
          detailed practices for a truly personal and ever-evolving experience
          of inner wisdom and growth.

          “Marianne Bentzen has been a pioneer in the field of somatics, child
          development, and neurobiology for many decades. This guide is a
          thoughtful and inspiring synthesis of her professional work as a
          psychotherapist as well as her life-long personal devotion to
          meditation and spiritual practice. Included is a cogent overview of
          her brilliant neuroaffective model to add theoretical substance to the
          practices. All will benefit from the depth and breadth of the
          meditations. Designed to expand our capacity for presence in the body,
          to deepen our connection to self and others, to inspire, to challenge
          deep-seated patterns, and, ultimately, to heal trauma. This guide will
          stimulate you intellectually, evoke a kaleidoscope of emotions, and
          drop you gently into the marvels of your inner world.”
