              >An immensely practical, hands-on journey through the techniques
              of the most radical mystical figure of the last century, Neville
              Goddard, who taught that your mind is God. This fresh take from a
              powerful new voice appeals to the growing audience around
              Neville.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />"According to Neville, there is only one power in the
          universe out of which all things emanate. Not a 'good' source and a
          separate 'evil' one, but <i>one </i>universal source bending in
          obedience to the creative will of men and women everywhere. The how
          remains a mystery; but this eternal fact is nonetheless true. As soon
          as I was able to feel and <i>accept</i> this to be true, I was free."
          --Katherine Jegede<br /><br />Growing up in London, Katherine Jegede
          was always searching for a philosophy to make sense of life. When she
          found the mind-as-creator philosophy of Neville Goddard, she thought
          she had found it. Falling victim to a terrible crime, however, caused
          Jegede to rethink everything she thought she knew. Rather than
          abandoning Neville's ideas, however, she discovered within them a new
          source of strength and fortitude. She not only rebounded from her
          crisis, but also used Neville's creative-mind principles to become a
          television presenter, something she had never before imagined
          possible.<br /><br />In this primer and introduction to Neville's
          methods, Jegede powerfully guides the reader through his
          techniques--and explains how to apply them, <i>now</i>, in your life.

          "Katherine Jegede’s great book is challenging and thought provoking.

          "In&nbsp;<i>Infinite Possibility</i>, Katherine Jegede faithfully and
          dynamically reintroduces the ideas and techniques of Neville Goddard
          to a new generation. Whether you are, like me, a longtime lover of
          Neville's work or a newcomer, this book provides you with an entirely
          fresh estimate of how much power these ideas can bring into your life.
          It is an invaluable addition to the growing rediscovery of Neville's
          work."<br /><b

          &nbsp;<br />"Finding meaning and transformation in life’s inevitable
          suffering is too often ignored in New Thought, but no longer thanks to
          the courageous Katherine Jegede. “You create your reality” can be a
          too easily applied band-aid for life’s horrors unless you’ve lived it.
          Katherine doesn’t take the easy road. She faced horror in her own
          life, ask the hard questions and came out on the other side by arguing
          with, testing and applying the teachings of her beloved Neville. This
          book, Infinite Possibility, is her gift to us, but only if we follow
          her lead by arguing with and testing the teachings to make them our
          own."<br />

          with a background in science. She was first introduced to metaphysics
          as a teenager by her mother, a former yoga teacher and education
          specialist. She developed a penetrating and enduring fondness for the
          self-empowering teachings of Neville Goddard, and remains just as
          steadfastly devoted to spreading his message today. After completing
          her studies, Katherine moved to Switzerland to work at the World
          Health Organization, developing educational resources for rural
          communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to her academic science
          career, Katherine has worked with the BBC Science Unit and BBC Radio
          Oxford, and served as news editor of the international journal
          <i>Africa Health</i>, for whom she has conducted research trips,
          helping set up a learning resources and study center at one of
          Nigeria's forefront teaching hospitals. She has been published in the
          internationally acclaimed science journal, Nature. Katherine has also
          presented two science series aimed at young adults for Channel 4 in
          the UK, earning a BAFTA nomination. She lives in London.
