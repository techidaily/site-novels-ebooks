          ***FINALIST, USA Best Books 2010 Awards – Spirituality &amp;
          Self-Help: Relationships<br /><br />
          The quest for lasting love is one of life’s essential pursuits, in
          some ways the most essential. But it’s also a quest that’s impossible
          to separate from spiritual and sexual needs. In
          <i>Eros Ascending, </i>author John Maxwell Taylor offers a
          wide-ranging study of sexual dysfunction in society and explains how
          healthy sexuality can be an entryway to universal love and higher
          consciousness. Based on Taylor’s twenty-three-year experience with
          Taoist practices, the book presents an engaging analysis of love,
          relationships, and sexuality from spiritual, romantic, and sexual
          perspectives. Taylor melds essential ideas by Jung, Gurdjieff, and
          Taoist Master Mantak Chia with science, biology, spiritual tradition,
          and current popular culture to shed new light on this eternal yet
          misunderstood subject. Not just for couples, the book is equally
          useful for single people who want to understand the methods for
          “learning to love yourself ” in preparation for a fulfilling,
          long-term relationship. Taylor draws on his eclectic background as a
          successful playwright, composer, actor, and musician in this
          persuasive plan for converting ordinary sexual energy into food for
          the soul.

          "<i>Eros Ascending</i>&nbsp;goes straight to the heart of the matter.
          It is a serious book about mature deep sexuality that takes itself
          lightly. It is a valuable guide to help people who have been sexually
          traumatized to regain their innate capacity for pleasure and
          goodness."<br />—Peter A. Levine, PhD, best-selling author of

          ><br /><br />“<i>Eros Ascending</i> is going to take you on an amazing
          journey toward the future of love in the Western world.”<br />
          —From the Foreword by Linda E. Savage, PhD, author of

          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Taylor is an erotic visionary after my own heart.
          <i>Eros Ascending</i> is a fun, highly readable next-gen Bible for
          lovers of sacred sex. While Taoist sexual techniques supply the
          practical energetic methods, he rolls into one believable, continuous
          orgasm Kriya Yoga, Gurdjieff,&nbsp;tantric ecstasy, Jungian androgyny,
          Plato, and sexual communion with&nbsp;deep Earth Goddess. It's loaded
          with practical ‘how-to’ tips and decades of amazing stories. He
          adroitly reverses Christianity's demonization of sex by revealing the
          inherently erotic nature of Christ-cum-Solar Logos. An enlightening
          and entertaining must read.”<br />
          —Michael Winn, coauthor with Mantak Chia,
          <i>Taoist Secrets of Love: Cultivating Male Sexual Energy</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Taylor understands the role of Eros as creating interconnection. He
          unites man and woman, Eros and Psyche, spirit and nature, and heaven
          and earth, while seeding our hearts and minds with a sense that our
          true destiny lies in reclaiming for ourselves the beauty of love. A
          unique and original masterwork.”<br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Eros Ascending</i> sharpens our focus on the power of loving
          consciously and intelligently. The book sweeps us into the
          twenty-first century with its breadth of&nbsp;vision and message of
          hope for true lovers everywhere. Destined to become a classic.”<br />

          &nbsp;<br />
          "Excellent! A sweeping intelligent study of sacred sex long overdue!
          Especially one helpful to individuals in their spiritual and sexual
          growth ... and useful to popular culture. Those practicing Tantra
          already will find their excitement rekindled, their minds stimulated,
          and spirits re-enthused as they move to the next evolutionary
          stage."<br />

          “<i>Eros Ascending</i> profoundly explores the power of shakti and
          sacred sexuality as life-transforming sacraments. [The book is] a
          journey into higher states of consciousness and ecstasy.”<br />
          —Charles Muir, author of

          &nbsp;<br />
          "<i>Eros Ascending</i> is one of the few and finest offerings to honor
          the concept of the sacredness of sexuality. The powerful knowledge,
          examples, and practices in this book have the ability to transform
          each and every one of us. As I dare to even imagine a world thus
          transformed, the tingle of energy rises up my spine in recognition of
          the divine ecstasy all around us."<br />

          "For any sexual explorer, like myself, this book is a must. [It is] a
          work of profound scope, weaving insight, information, and inspiration
          into a rich tapestry of personal experience."<br />

          "Playing Carl Gustav Jung in his marvelous award-winning twenty
          character one-man play <i>Forever Jung </i>(which I saw twice) must
          have had a profound effect on John Maxwell Taylor. In
          <i>Eros Ascending</i> he speaks with a depth of humanity and
          psychological insight that Jung would doubtless recognize as a
          complete expression of the author’s living ethos. This book transcends
          the mere scholarly to reach through the mind and touch the soul.<br />

          Center of Houston<br />
