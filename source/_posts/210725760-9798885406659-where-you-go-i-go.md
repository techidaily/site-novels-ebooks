            What you hold in your hand is a tool to guide you through unknown
            seasons with the Word of God as your compass. Written during the
            first long global lockdown in 2020 for our newly scattered
            sisterhood, this study proved to be a powerful lifeline, not just
            among the sisters who joined us in online discussions but, more
            importantly, among the individual souls and their creator.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Over and over, dear friends shared that they heard God's voice for
            themselves with new clarity, and that is our deepest prayer for you.
            In the spirit of Ruth and Naomi, we recommend journeying with an
            accountability partner, but should that not be available to you,
            Jesus himself will fill that gap.
          </p>
          <p></p>

            Though often applied to waiting for our earthly Boaz, the book of
            Ruth is much more than that. From famine, death, and bitterness to
            the layers of friendship and longing, these ancient themes reveal
            profound relevance. And their author is inviting us on a journey
            with him that is simultaneously individual and interdependent.
          </p>

            The timeless Word of God is so rich in its own right, guiding the
            reader back to himself. Much of this study simply unpacks Hebrew
            definitions and cultural contexts to better attune our hearts to the
            nuanced intentions of its author. By allowing the Word to speak for
            itself, the goal of this study is to create a space where our hearts
            are prepared to receive him.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            But while the seed of the sower is incorruptible, the soil of our
            hearts varies. One way or another, every soul has been shattered,
            and every human mind has a filter through which we perceive him.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Each day begins with preparing our garden. We connect to our honest
            thoughts and emotions, and through different exercises engaging soul
            through body, we break up the fallow ground to receive the Word.
          </p>

            Elisabet's weekly thought-provoking questions draw one to meditate,
            be still, examine, and savor the revelatory insights that are gained
            about oneself and our relationship to our living creator. The
            greatest gift of this study was how Elisabet made space for my
            faith, Scripture, and much-needed introspective work we all so
            desperately need. The Book of Ruth is none other than a gentle slow
            dance toward our heavenly Father, Abba, Jesus, and the Holy
            Spirit--while engaging the whole of ourselves in this holistic
            experience. (Sambra Zaoui, LCSW, CCTP, EMDR)
