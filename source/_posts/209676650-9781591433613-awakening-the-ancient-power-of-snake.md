          A look at the mythic, archetypal, and transformational aspects of
          Snake <br /><br />• Explores how and why Snake was transformed from
          esteemed advisor and guardian of ancient wisdom to a symbol of
          deception and evil <br /><br />• Examines Snake’s healing powers, its
          role in awakening kundalini, and its connections to dreams, shamanism,
          alchemy, and the Goddess <br /><br />• Shares transformational stories
          and practical ways that Snake can help us travel through the imaginal
          realm, gather treasure from the psyche, and shed outgrown aspects of
          self <br /><br />Entwined with human consciousness since prehistoric
          times, Snake has always been associated with transformation--from the
          shedding of its skin to the rising of kundalini energy. In ancient
          times, Snake served as protector and advisor to gods, goddesses, and
          royalty. But with the story of Adam and Eve, Snake became the enemy--a
          tempter and deceiver. How did this happen and why do humans continue
          to fear and vilify Snake? Inspired by a vivid dream of an immense
          snake that lost its tail, animal communicator Dawn Baumann Brunke
          investigates the interwoven history of Snake and humanity and explores
          how we can once again access Snake’s wisdom and harness its powerful
          ability to heal, transform, and awaken. <br /><br />Uncovering ties
          between Snake and Goddess, the author demonstrates how both were
          systematically suppressed millennia ago with the spread of a
          patriarchal perspective that valued mastery over nature, God over
          Goddess. Brunke reveals how myths that originally extolled the virtues
          of Snake and Goddess were refashioned, recreating their images as
          debased and untrustworthy. She explores why snakes show up in shamanic
          journeys and transformational dreams and how their unique presence in
          our world can serve as catalysts of change, truth-telling, and
          enlightenment. <br /><br />Examining Snake’s role in awakening human
          consciousness, Brunke considers the alchemical role of the serpent as
          well as Snake’s connections to ancient healing, modern medicine, and
          even the DNA molecule. She shares psycho-activating stories to help
          trigger transformation and provide graceful movement through the chaos
          of change. And she offers practical techniques to journey with Snake
          through inner worlds, to shed confining aspects of self, and to
          integrate experiences more holistically. <br /><br />Brunke shows how
          we need to re-embrace the ancient power of Snake to better support our
          return to a more balanced consciousness--one that reunites nature with
          spirit, sacred masculine with sacred feminine--as we strive for global
          change and personal awakening.

          “As a dream analyst, each time I hear a dream with Snake I know it to
          be a potent vision carrying an important message. This is the book I
          have long been wishing for--a single reference for clients to deepen
          their understanding of the dream experience with Snake. Dawn Brunke’s
          vast research, deep insight, and elegant writing on this subject are
          breathtaking. Reader beware: if you pick this book up, you may not be
          able to put it down! I was swept away.”
