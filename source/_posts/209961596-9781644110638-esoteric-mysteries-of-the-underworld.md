          A comprehensive guide to the ancient beliefs and spiritual power of
          subterranean spaces <br /><br />• Examines in depth the myths,
          symbology, deities, and beliefs connected to the underworld from many
          different cultures and mystery traditions <br /><br />• Investigates
          the role of the underworld in initiatory rites and mystical practices,
          such as the Orphic Mysteries, the chambers of reflections in
          Freemasonry, the cult of the Black Madonna, and the cult of Isis
          <br /><br />• Discusses the telluric currents that run through ley
          lines, the significance of underground waterways, Hollow Earth theory,
          and the denizens of the subterranean realms, such as dragons, gnomes,
          and dwarfs <br /><br />Ancient cultures around the world understood
          the spiritual powers of the underworld. For millennia, natural caves
          and caverns were turned into sacred underground temples and, from holy
          mountains and cliffs, churches were beautifully carved into solid
          rock. <br /><br />Offering a guide to the spiritual energies that
          flourish beneath the surface of the Earth, Jean-Pierre Bayard explores
          the esoteric mysteries of the underworld, including the symbolic
          significance of caves, caverns, and underground temples. He examines
          in depth the myths, symbology, deities, and beliefs connected to the
          underworld from many different cultures and mystery traditions, from
          ancient Egypt to Scandinavia and Europe to the Middle East and India.
          He investigates the role of the underworld in initiatory rites, such
          as the Orphic Mysteries and Christ’s descent into hell, revealing that
          at the heart of these teachings is the transformative power of a
          hero’s descent into and return from the underworld. The author
          connects the esoteric attributes of the world below with the cult of
          the Black Madonna and the earlier cult of Isis. He discusses the
          telluric currents that run through ley lines, the significance of
          underground waterways, the esoteric properties of gems and stones, and
          the “mineral blood” of the alchemists. He also looks at Hollow Earth
          theory and the denizens of the subterranean realms, such as dragons,
          gnomes, and dwarfs. <br /><br />Explaining how the Earth is the womb
          of the world, Bayard shows how initiatic descent into the sacred
          subterranean realms reflects the descent of spirit into matter and its
          slow crystallization. By entering the body of the Earth Mother we are
          transformed, initiated into primordial wisdom and reborn as spiritual
          beings.

          “What I also love about this book is how Bayard takes all of this
          information and somehow manages to not only make it interesting, but
          to also leave space for the reader to question. There is no feeling
          that the material presented is the final word on any of the subjects
          contained within: this is more of collection of writings on a variety
          of topics that all have an esoteric thread linking them to one
          another. Each section blends seamlessly into the next and there is
          enough information in each section that links to the next, something
          that I found kept me on track and engaged despite the vast amount of
          information being presented.”
