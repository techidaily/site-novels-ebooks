            >Reconnect to your soul’s innate wisdom with ancient healing
            practices, nature-based wisdom, and psychological principles--live
            authentically, nourish your inner power, and be a force for personal
            and collective liberation.</b
          ><br /><br />If you’ve ever wondered what was missing--or felt out of
          step with the social and cultural programming of the westernized
          worldview--Soul Authority will empower you to find balance, build your
          soul sanctuary, and become a powerful agent of positive
          transformation.<br /><br />There is a soul authority that exists in
          all of us, a higher knowing that connects us to each other, the living
          Earth, and back to ourselves--even as we live in a world that sows
          division, destruction, and uncertainty. Shamanic eco-psychologist
          Loraine Van Tuyl, PhD, shows you how to tap into this innate wisdom,
          giving you the tools to trust its insights, hear its voice, and come
          home to our interrelated collective soul.<br /><br />Interwoven with
          stories from the author’s personal journey from growing up in Suriname
          during a military coup to pursuing her doctorate in clinical
          psychology amid a profound spiritual awakening, Soul Authority is an
          inspiring alchemical exploration of rekindling the deep knowing that’s
          accessible to all of us.<br /><br />Through exercises, reflections,
          and concrete action steps, you’ll discover:<br /><br />
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;How to find your own True North, the
          guiding compass aligned with your inner truth<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Practical
          skills for combatting the burnout, overwhelm, and disconnection that
          prevents us from making a bigger impact in the world<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
          How to tap into the soul mission that nourishes your purpose<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;How
          your healing journey and collective liberation are interconnected<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
          How to heal the “ancestral deficit” and “nature deficit” that leave
          you overwhelmed<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;Strategies for
          grounding, clearing, visibility, and creativity

          "Dr. Van Tuyl’s highly readable book is exactly what the world needs
          right now. Her Soul Authority system has offered me the tools and the
          robust yet malleable framework I need to reconnect to my core self,
          heal intergenerational trauma, and move through life feeling more
          grounded, centered, and empowered."<br />—Sharline Chiang, writer,
          activist, and co-host of <i>Democracy in Color</i><br /><br />"Dr. Van
          Tuyl’s provocative deep dive into the tremendous upheaval caused by
          today’s social, environmental, and political tsunamis lays a solid
          foundation that will inspire readers to transform from passive
          spectator to committed change agent. Her seasoned professional
          experience shines through as she takes the reader on a journey to
          release buried shackles of old trauma and heal soul wounds. Her
          pitfall alerts, relatable examples, research-based nuggets, highlights
          of Soul Authority sessions, and step-by-step meditation scripts to
          reconnect with the elements made me feel as if I was being accompanied
          by a trusted guide while exploring a fresh and unorthodox path of
          transformation and realignment."<br />—Mirella Baker Bemmel, EdD,
          sociology professor, founder of Next Level Educators, and author of
          <i>Building Blocks to an Abundant Life</i><br /><br />"<i
            >Soul Authority</i
          >
          is incredibly rich, complex, and nuanced in both its breadth and
          depth, yet approachable for readers of diverse backgrounds and all
          levels of contemplative practice. Van Tuyl’s innovative approach is
          grounded in her professional, spiritual, and multicultural histories
          and informed by current-day events that readers will recognize as
          touchstones of their own. Rather than follow a specific program to
          arrive at a specific conclusion, I felt invited to pull from a rich
          compendium to discover and develop my own innate wisdom and “soul
          authority.” Parts of this book skillfully anchored me in familiarity
          and parts invited me to explore, stretch, and grow."<br />—Peggy
          Acott, certified life-cycle celebrant and co-author of
          <i>Portland Made</i><br /><br />"The Soul Authority methods that
          Loraine Van Tuyl has streamlined in her book provide an essential key
          to unlocking emotional resiliency and are helping me to tackle every
          challenge in my life and career. I recommend it to other empaths in
          search of healing and intuitive insight on how to uncover the dazzling
          potential and inherent power present in their sensitivity."<br />—Lily
          Roberts, MA, JD, attorney<br /><br />"Loraine Van Tuyl’s
          <i>Soul Authority</i> provides a road map to the spiritual solace and
          strength we all need to shed our chains of internalized oppression.
          Now more than ever, we need the teachings highlighted on these pages
          to repair and empower our individual and collective lives. As someone
          who was seeking their Soul Authority and found it with the guidance
          offered in this book, I cannot<br />recommend it enough!"<br />—Esperanza
          Padilla, co-president of Spectrum: Autism at Cal<br /><br />"In this
          exquisite guide to personal and planetary healing, Dr. Loraine Van
          Tuyl has crafted a warm invitation to explore our own soul authority
          and showcases how this deeper work can build a better, more equitable
          and just world. Reading her book was a deeply transformational and
          emotional experience for me. It was both refreshing and relieving to
          feel immersed in a vast community of like-minded folks committed to
          this internal healing and external work. <i>Soul</i><br /><i

          is essential for those of us doing both spiritual and social justice
          work, and is an absolute joy to read! I am so grateful to have these
          tools at my disposal and feel energized to continue sharpening my soul
          authority using the wisdom of the Earth’s four elements and the
          brilliance of my own inner sanctuary."<br />—Jessica Calvanico, PhD,
          feminist and racial justice researcher, educator, and writer<br /><br />"Dr.
          Van Tuyl’s book will take you on a rich and courageous journey towards
          a path of discovering your own soul authority and potential. I gained
          much insight into our personal connection to the environmental,
          political, and social challenges we face in today’s world. As a
          sensitive soul, I found myself intimately reflected throughout her
          book, and saw it as a call to action. The action of coming home to
          myself, with the deep understanding that renaturing myself is
          essential in living my soul’s purpose to help heal our world. I found
          myself filled with hope and equipped with expansive tools to open up
          to the inner wisdom provided by nature and ancestral guidance. This
          book has empowered me to step into the truth of who I am—divinely
          guided, loved, and supported in all directions."<br />—Laviza Fuentes,
