            >"Be prepared to laugh and cry (sometimes on the same page) as you
            delve into Holly's deeply personal story of God's never-ending
            presence throughout all of life's unexpected twists and turns. The
            difficulties of life are shared without pretense in a raw and
            transparent way that anyone can connect with, dotted with humor and
            reality checks along the way. This is a message of hope in the midst
            of a series of daunting personal experiences that would send many
            into an unhealthy pattern of placing shame and blame on God and
            others so that we could then justifiably claim our spot in the
            victim's seat for the remainder of life. But Holly shares a
            different perspective with a heartfelt desire to use her experiences
            to encourage those who find themselves facing their own difficult
            days. This is ultimately a story of God's love and provision in
            whatever comes our way; it's also a story of examining and refining
            belief and faith when we're tested by fire. I encourage you to take
            this journey with Holly. You'll walk away being encouraged and
            hopeful that, no matter what comes your way, healing is possible and
            God is ever present, even on our darkest days."</span

            tragedies be turned into a great adventure with the Lord? Holly has
            learned practical ways to entrust her life, and the lives of her
            children, to God through her pain. And she has seen God use that
            pain to produce pearls-a string of glowing pearls-to hold near to
            her own heart and to share with others as a testimony of God's
            goodness and power."</span
