              >In this next installment of the Manifestation trilogy, renowned
              channel Paul Selig shares the words of The Guides as they offer a
              glimpse of a world that transcends our own limited understanding. </b
            ><br /><br />The Guides, otherworldly beings with deep spiritual
            insight, speak directly through Paul, and their message has been
            transcribed word for word in this revolutionary new volume.<br /><br /><i
              >The Book of Innocence</i
            >
            invites readers to explore a new vision of themselves and the lives
            they lead—one that is pristine, fundamental, and innate. Instead of
            being blinded by spiritual and physical distractions, The Guides
            offer a return to the primal simplicity of a deeper knowing. This
            powerful book welcomes readers into a paradigm shifting experience
            of renewal and rebirth, shedding cynicism and conceit in favor of
            authentic, life-changing innocence.

          "The book is incredible<i>...</i>Absolutely impeccable....one of the
          most important perspectives we can hold to guide us in this time."<br />—
          <b>Aubrey Marcus, </b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author
          <br /><br />"Throughout every historical epoch, the universe speaks to
          us directly through exceptionally sensitive individuals. Paul Selig is
          one of those individuals. The <i>Book of Innocence</i> is the latest
          gift in his series of intriguing channeled teachings."<br />—
          <b>Dean Radin, MS, PhD</b>, chief scientist for the Institute of
          Noetic Sciences and author or <i>Real Magic</i><br /><br />"<i
            >The Book of Innocence</i
          >
          is a culmination of Selig’s illuminating library of channeled texts,
          enhancing The Guides' earlier teachings with an eye-opening clarity.
          It presents an indisputable case for dismantling our belief in
          separation, an invitation to recognize our true nature (our
          innocence), and instructions for reclaiming this divinity within us,
          which has been concealed by our chosen identity. If there were ever a
          manual for rebirth and awakening, this is it. By far, my favorite
          channeled book to date."<br />— <b>Bob Olson</b>, author of

          <br /><br />"Paul Selig channels wisdom with integrity and clarity,
          allowing us all to find the beacon within us. Each of his books is a

          Paul Selig brings us another essential channeled text. This book is a
          powerful guide along the spiritual path, reminding readers of their
          divine center and how to access this center in their lives.
          <i>THE BOOK OF INNOCENCE</i> is an important book."<br />–
          <b>Shaman Durek, </b>bestselling author of <i>Spirit Hacking</i>,
          activist, and thought leader <br /><br />"Both challenging and
          encouraging, <i>The Book of Innocence</i> is a deep ride through the
          heart of truth, speaking directly to the ways we diminish ourselves,
          and the innate ease of innocence that is always available. Beautifully
          written, laced with powerful insight, Selig’s channeled books are the
          purest voice out there right now."<br />– <b>Natalie Sudman</b>,
