            rely on nature, privacy, and a lack of prying eyes from those around
            them. But in a city or urban area, that’s not always possible. In
            <i>City Witchery</i>, Lisa Marie Basile explores how the city can be
            an asset to a witch’s practice, rather than a limitation."</b
