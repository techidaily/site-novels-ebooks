          • Reveals how the author, a long-time Buddhist practitioner, found
          ayahuasca to be a remarkable catalyst on his spiritual path,
          ultimately reinvigorating his own practice<br /><br />
          • Explores the ayahuasca ceremony process in depth, detailing the
          author’s multi-session experience in Peru and “best practices” when
          taking ayahuasca<br /><br />
          • Offers an introduction to Tibetan Buddhist practice, including a
          guided instruction to four progressive techniques of Shamata Vipassana
          meditation<br /><br />
          Over the last several decades, serious study of Tibetan Buddhism and
          the use of ayahuasca as an agent for spiritual growth have both become
          widespread in the West. Though the two traditions originate in widely
          different parts of the world, both are effective in working with the
          ego and creating a genuine spiritual opening.<br /><br />
          Uniting the two paths, C. Clinton Sidle takes readers through his own
          journey as a long-time but sometimes-struggling Buddhist practitioner
          whose sojourn to Peru for a series of ayahuasca ceremonies provided an
          invaluable shift in his own spiritual approach. Sidle reveals how
          ayahuasca was a remarkable catalyst in pointing out self-deception in
          his spiritual path, providing insight into psychoemotional obstacles
          to spiritual growth and ultimately reinvigorating his practice and
          authentic presence in daily life. But, as the author points out,
          although a skillful means and a useful aid, ayahuasca is not a
          complete path on its own.<br /><br />
          Introducing Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and the calm mindfulness of
          Shamata Vipassana meditation, as a sustainable developmental path to
          support and integrate the awakenings catalyzed by ayahuasca, Sidle
          emphasizes the complementary nature of both his work in Peru and his
          longer-term studies in Buddhism. He describes his own challenges with
          spiritual self-deception and stagnation—not uncommon on the Buddhist
          path—and explains the structure of the Nyingma School of Tibetan
          Buddhism. Finally, the author shares how he integrated the lessons of
          his ayahuasca experiences into his Buddhist practice, offering readers
          a methodical and guided introduction to four progressive techniques of
          Shamata Vipassana meditation.<br /><br />
          Whether readers are long-term seekers or novices, this book can
          provide a singular means of aligning and re-invigorating the spiritual
          path.
