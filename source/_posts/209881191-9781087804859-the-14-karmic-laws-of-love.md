          <p>
            Most people go through life without understanding the purpose of
            their existence or how their past reincarnations keep affecting
            their decisions and emotions in the present time, and even
            interfering with the dynamics of their relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we donâ€™t necessarily always find someone we met in a
            previous life, it is a fact that, due to our predisposed energy
            field and the way it is arranged, we tend to always be drawn towards
            those with whom we have an emotional connection with, and for good
            or for worse. That connection tends to find reasons within our
            karmic path.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see, one way or another, we are attracted to what is
            beautiful or broken. But the outside is always a reflection of the
            inside, and both elements of reality complement one another. The
            physical world is nothing but the theatre of our spiritual
            manifestations and learnings.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, there are different reasons behind our many behaviors and
            thoughts, most of which are much older than we want to believe. The
            physical aspect of them is nothing but a form of justification
            within a wider spectrum related to our own eternal growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The more you understand this and learn to actually see it, the
            faster you will be in learning how to make proper decisions towards
            your most desired outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this book, you will gain a better perception of how karma affects
            your life, and how previous reincarnations affect the way you think.
            You will also learn how to clean your karma, how to find your
            soulmate, and how to keep a healthy relationship with someone you
            have met in another life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the path that is unveiled here, will guide you in
            finding your true self, while identifying the traits that can make
            you a better person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most likely, what makes this book completely unique, among so many
            others on this topic, is that while it was being written, it was
            also happening to the author himself. Basically, the author found a
            soulmate during the editing process and decided to include here an
            in-depth analysis of the story, to help his readers in understanding
            the topic with a pragmatic and honest approach to it, and without
            occulting any personal aspects.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parallel between the theory, the analysis, and the reality, will
            guide you towards finding real love in the most comprehensive way
            possible.
