            Cultivating Minds To Own Thyself&nbsp;was birthed with the
            intentions of helping men and women discover their purpose and to
            take ownership of their life without using society's standards. It
            teaches readers how to examine themselves in attempt to modify their
            thoughts and in turn become their best self as well as make a
            difference in the lives of others.

            Davis’&nbsp;tale outlines what it takes to overcome having a false
            identity and being miseducated and conditioned by society’s
            norm.&nbsp;

          <span>And a good #purpose at that</span>&nbsp;- First and foremost, it
          starts with wanting to change. If you don't want to change, how will
          you grow, evolve, succeed and shine?&nbsp; "Don't say I do want to
          change, but see..." because then you are only making excuses to hinder
          these things from becoming. If you really want to start or stop
          anything, you will do just that. So, start today with the action of
          changing the way you think, the way you behave, and what will become
          your future. There's purpose out here for us all. And a good #purpose
          at that. Meditate, concentrate, elevate and grab a copy of
          "Cultivating Minds To Own Thyself Cleveland Author Jameel Davis. It's
          something that can and will help with this process. An abundance of
          pure necessity within the first few pages.
