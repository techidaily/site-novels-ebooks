            >A “brilliant and fascinating” (Eben Alexander, MD, author of
            <i>Proof of Heaven</i>) exploration—rich with powerful personal
            stories and convincing research—of the many ways the living can and
            do accompany the dying on their journey into the afterlife. </b
          ><br /><br />In 2000, end-of-life therapist William Peters was
          volunteering at the Zen Hospice Project in San Francisco when he had
          an extraordinary experience as he was reading aloud to a patient: he
          suddenly felt himself floating midair, completely out of his body. The
          patient, who was also aloft, looked at him and smiled. The next
          moment, Peters felt himself return to his body…but his patient never
          regained consciousness and died.<br />
          <br />Perplexed and stunned by what had happened, Peters began
          searching for other people who’d shared similar experiences. He would
          spend the next twenty years gathering and meticulously categorizing
          their stories to identify key patterns and features of what is now
          known as the “shared crossing” experience. The similarities, which cut
          across continents and cultures and include awe-inspiring visual and
          sensory effects, and powerful emotional aftershocks.<br />
          <br />The book is filled with “moving and tender” (Jack Kornfield,
          PhD, author of <i>A Path with Heart</i>) tales of spouses seeing their
          loved ones reach the other side after decades together and bereaved
          parents who share their children’s entry into the afterlife. Applying
          rigorous research, Peters digs into the effects of these shared
          crossing experiences impart—liberation at the sight of a loved one
          finding joy, a sense of reconciliation if the relationship was
          fraught—and explores questions like: What can explain these shared
          death experiences? How can we increase our likelihood of having one?
          What do these experiences tell us about what lies beyond? And, most
          importantly, how can they help take away the string of death and
          better prepare us for our own final moments? How can we have both a
          better life and a better death?

          “This brilliant and fascinating research about shared death
          experiences removes the conventional myth of death’s finality and
          shows how love binds us together beyond the material realm. Highly
          recommended!”&nbsp;<br />
