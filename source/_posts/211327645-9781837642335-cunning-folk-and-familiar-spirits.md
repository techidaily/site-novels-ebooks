          This book contains the first comprehensive examination of popular
          familiar belief in early modern Britain. It provides an in-depth
          analysis of the correlation between early modern British magic and
          tribal shamanism, examines the experiential dimension of popular magic
          and witchcraft in early modern Britain, and explores the links between
          British fairy beliefs and witch beliefs. In the hundreds of
          confessions relating to witchcraft and sorcery trials in early modern
          Britain there are detailed descriptions of intimate working
          relationships between popular magical practitioners and familiar
          spirits of either human or animal form. Until recently historians
          often dismissed these descriptions as elaborate fictions created by
          judicial interrogators eager to find evidence of stereotypical pacts
          with the Devil. Although this paradigm is now routinely questioned,
          and most historians acknowledge that there was a folkloric component
          to familiar lore in the period, these beliefs, and the experiences
          reportedly associated with them, remain substantially unexplored. This
          book examines the folkloric roots of familiar lore from historical,
          anthropological and comparative religious perspectives. It argues that
          beliefs about witches' familiars were rooted in beliefs surrounding
          the use of fairy familiars by beneficent magical practitioners or
          cunning folk', and corroborates this through a comparative analysis of
          familiar beliefs found in traditional Native American and Siberian
          shamanism. The author explores the experiential dimension of familiar
          lore by drawing parallels between early modern familiar encounters and
          visionary mysticism as it appears in both tribal shamanism and
          medieval European contemplative traditions. These perspectives
          challenge the reductionist view of popular magic in early modern
          Britain often presented by historians.

          "Magic and witchcraft have between them represented one of the most
          difficult and challenging subjects for modern historians. Emma Wilby's
          book is a remarkably interesting, timely and novel way of looking at
          them, and one of the most courageous yet attempted." -- Professor
          Ronald Hutton, University of Bristol.<br />"Emma Wilby's conclusions
          and her explanation of how she drew them, laid down here in the
          commendable modern academic tendency towards plain English that has
          moved away from the previous generation's overly complex sentence
          structure, is worth its weight in gold." Ian Read in Runa Magazine,
          Issue 19, October 2006.<br />"...one of the few books to treat in any
          detail, and perhaps the only one to treat at length, the topic of the
          witch's familiar ... these kinds of consideration are very fruitful
          for understanding much fortean material ... 8/10" -- Fortean Times,
          July 2006.<br />"This is the definitive study of familiar lore, which
          should find a place on every Witch's bookshelf." -- Witchcraft and
          Wicca Magazine, Imbolc/Winter 2007.<br />"...valuably sets the ground
          for further exploration of the role and character of folk magic within
          community and tradition and is to be recommeded for that." -- Northern
          Earth Issue 105.<br />"...a powerful, grounding work for all modern
          magical practicioners of British magical tradition." -- Pagan Times
          Australia, Spring 2006.<br />"...fascinating and well-researched. It
          is a genuine contribution to what is known about cunning folk and lays
          very solid foundations for future work on the subject. Buy it today!"
          -- White Dragon, Beltane 2006.<br />"...riveting and downright
          encouraging review of the magical underpinning of mainstream culture."
          -- Sacred Hoop, Issue 51, 2006.
