              >Imagine a world where everyone has access to all the stories of
              your ancestors, this would help you to connect to your lineage,
              heal relationships, and enable these stories to be passed down to
              future generations.</strong

            In this book, I discuss real-life ancestral stories. For example, a
            family with a history of Parkinson's disease across many
            generations. The ancestral healer tracked the origin of the illness
            to a time in Africa when an ancestor witnessed the death of her
            brother, who was bitten by a snake. This caused the essence of this
            trauma to manifest in Parkinson's disease for future generations
            until the time came for it to be reviewed by the ancestral healer,
            which cleared and healed it for all future generations in the
            lineage. This is one of the many real-life stories that are shared
            in this book, obtained from the author's client work and group
            workshops during the completion of genuine energetic healing work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process of illuminating the shadow aids soul healing and
            evolution. Healing ancestral patterns is the key to unlock shadow
            work. As more souls embody more of their source energy on Earth,
            delving into the shadow is more important than ever. It frees us
            from energy and patterns that do not serve us anymore. In these
            turbulent times, the shadow is staring us in the face on an
            individual and collective level; this is an important time to
            complete this work. This book shares pioneering knowledge and wisdom
            about shadow and ancestral work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Illuminating the shadow provides access to the gold; the healing and
            the wisdom, within which are the secrets of the universe ready to be
            accessed. Healing the ancestral shadow brings more joy into your
            life, along with improved relationships with your family and
            everyone around you. It provides a deep and safe exploration through
            all the ancestral layers that hold the key to your healing. Our own
            shadow often manifests itself as an opportunity to delve into the
            shadow and to find the story behind what is causing us pain.

          Engineering ChangeCurses - Distorting Ancestral RealityEntities -

          the ancestors - Celebration of divine inheritance
          <p>
            Each chapter contains real-life ancestor stories from ancestral
            healing sessions, which are fascinating and empowering. The book
            creates an opportunity for the reader to reflect on how humanity has
            created much of its own trauma, and therefore the manifestation of
            similar patterns and illness that have continued down the
            generations. Reflection on this, which the book enables, illuminates
            the responsibility that we all have to pave a new better future for
            our families and future generations.
