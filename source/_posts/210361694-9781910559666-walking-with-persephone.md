            Midlife can be a time of great change - inner and outer. How do we
            journey through this...and what can we learn in the process? Molly
            Remer is our personal guide to the unraveling and reweaving required
            in midlife. She invites us to take a walk with the goddess
            Persephone, whose story of descent into the Underworld has much to
            teach us. This book is a journey of soul-rebuilding, of putting the
            pieces of oneself back together.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Walking with Persephone&nbsp;weaves together personal insights and
            reflections with experiences in practical priestessing, family life,
            and explorations of the natural world. It advocates opening our eyes
            to the wonder around us, encouraging the reader to both look within
            themselves for truths about living, but also to the earth, the air,
            the animals, and plants we share our lives with.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Part memoir, part poetry, part soul guide, Molly's evocative voice
            is in the great American tradition of sacred nature writing.

          What a gloriously contemplative, hopeful, truthful book. It took me
          deep into my innermost heart and reminded me of the simple grace of
          being alive. A book to keep nearby when you forget what matters most.

          Growing up as a high-achiever and a good girl, Molly Remer always did
          everything she could for everyone else, until it became too much. Her
          story of "losing her soul" will resonate with many women. She learns
          that it is necessary to do less for others in order to restore her
          self.

          Walking with Persephone opened my heart in such an unexpected way; I
          felt as though I were having an intimate conversation with a dear
          friend. Molly's words felt like an echo of my own deepest thoughts and
          questions and revelations as I have journeyed along the path to
          middle-age. As I have learned from my many years of leading Red Tent
          circles, we women need each other's stories in order to understand our
          own lives. In Walking with Persephone, Molly gifts us all with a
          powerful and much-needed story of personal transformation and
          reclamation.

          Packed with Molly Remer's glorious prose and poetry, Walking with
          Persephone is a heartfelt and glorious read. My copy is furiously
          marked up with passages to return to. There is much wisdom and healing
          to be found in this very relatable book.

          I smiled often in recognition while reading Molly Remer's account of
          her midlife underworld journey,Walking with Persephone. Like her, I
          find sustenance in my relationship with the natural world, the power
          of Place, and the Sacred Feminine. I see myself and my community in
          her story as she meets the challenge of tending to the needs of her
          inner life while not abandoning responsibilities to family and work. I
          loved the authenticity of her ruminations; it was like having a
          heartfelt talk with a good friend. Her words sparked my own creativity
          as I read, even though midlife is behind me and I grapple with
          different challenges. All of us will descend and rise time and time
          again over the course of our lives. I recommend this book as an
          inspiring map for navigating your own underworld journey, complete
          with tools and devotional practices to guide you on your way.

          This book is a guide to those who feel torn between the needs of
          family and community and the needs of their own soul. If you are a
          lover of solitude who finds herself doing too much, this book is a
          consolation. While Molly Remer does not offer easy answers, she offers
          a way forward by staying with the tension in her own life. She roots
          herself in the natural world, in her fierce belief in everyday magic,
          in the stories of Persephone, and in daily rituals that will nurture
          and sustain. And she invites and inspires the reader to do the same.
          She carefully and honestly explores burnout, overcommitment, and also
          the tender hope that perhaps the needs of her own soul are not as far
          off as she may initially think from the life she has so carefully
          crafted.
