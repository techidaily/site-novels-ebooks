              Frio (Cape Cold), the birthplace of my grandfather Edmundo, who
              introduced Leonel to the real characters, in spirit, so that he
              could bring his story as an example to us all. But the story is
              not his, nor was he the one who lived it. His characters are
              people he once knew, even though he had no closer relationship
              with any of them. Those were things of small towns, at the end of
              the 19th century, where everyone knew each other, at least by name
              or when they found out about it.</span

              that took place in that house, and, for the city's inhabitants,
              they were just people who lived there, halfway through everything
              and everyone. Quiet and unimportant people, who did not attract
              anyone's attention.</span
