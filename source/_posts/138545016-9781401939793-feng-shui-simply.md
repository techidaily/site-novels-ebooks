          In <i>Feng Shui Simply</i>, <b>Cheryl Grace</b> digs deep into the
          principles of feng shui to present an exciting new view of this
          age-old concept and shows that feng shui isn’t just about rearranging
          your furniture or painting your walls; it goes much deeper. She opens
          your eyes to how feng shui can be used to balance the energy of every
          part of your life—both in your external and internal environments.
          Grace shows that bringing your focus to both of these worlds is a
          powerful way to design the life you’re meant to live.<br /><br />In
          these pages, Grace takes you on a journey to design your living spaces
          using the classic Bagua map—a chart separating physical spaces into
          nine areas, each representing a different aspect of life, such as
          wealth, family, and career. But perhaps more importantly, she goes one
          step further, teaching you the inner work of feng shui using her own
          Inner Wisdom Bagua map, which correlates the characteristics, beliefs,
          and attitudes that will help you flourish in each area of your
          life.<br /><br />Sharing anecdotes from her own experience switching
          careers from an ESPN executive to a feng shui consultant, as well as
          her clients’ success stories, Grace walks you through each area of the
          standard and Inner Wisdom Bagua maps to create unique solutions for
          your life. She teaches you to harness the power of your intuition to
          determine what’s true and important for you. And she offers practical
          tools based on concepts such as Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, and
          the Magical Day, to help you figure out which enhancements will be the
          most effective in transforming your life.<br /><br />By celebrating
          key principles like universal gratitude, a positive outlook, and
          living in the present moment, she shows you how to manage life on a
          day-to-day basis and points you toward your life’s true purpose.
