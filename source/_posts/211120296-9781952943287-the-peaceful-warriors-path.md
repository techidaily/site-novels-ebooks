            &nbsp;The Peaceful Warrior's Path is a practical guide for people of
            all ages, regardless of physical&nbsp;condition. It provides
            concepts, tools, techniques, and exercises that you can use every
            day, no&nbsp;matter where you are or what you are doing, to promote
            a sense of ease rather than angst. It is a&nbsp;motivational program
            for living resiliently, ready for anything, with health, happiness,
            and&nbsp;success, passionately involved and at peace with things as
            they are-and doing it ethically with&nbsp;kindness and compassion.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;When it comes to becoming happier and more effective, what
            matters is your intention, how&nbsp;open-minded you are, and your
            willingness to work on yourself to change your mind and
            open&nbsp;your heart. With the right mindset, intention, and effort
            you might just experience enlightenment.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;The Peaceful Warrior's Path weaves together self-awareness,
            mindfulness, meditation, stress management, and relaxation
            techniques, and emotional, spiritual, and social intelligence to
            sustain optimal&nbsp;wellness and enhance performance in whatever
            you do.&nbsp;

          "Very timely read as almost everyone I work with in my psychotherapy
          practice is incredibly stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, and facing
          inner turmoil. I recommend this easy to digest and yet profound book
          to help us all move through these challenging times."

          "The Peaceful Warrior's Path combines vast experience, deep thought,
          and practical techniques. Some books run away with spiritual matters,
          leaving us standing where we stood in the bookstore. George's human
          qualities shine through, illuminating a practical, common-sense
          approach."

          "George Pitagorsky is a master teacher of mindfulness-based management
          strategies. George embodies what he dispenses: practical wisdom that
          produces tangible results. His wisdom and effectiveness are on par
          with the best. This, in my view, makes his teaching and books
          alluring."

          "The Peaceful Warrior's Path offers a generous, practical, and
          panoramic approach. This groundbreaking system is designed to give
          every aspect of one's life greater meaning, success, and fulfillment.
          It is also refreshingly non-sectarian. George Pitagorsky has created a
          remarkably complete path to make life a healthy and awakened journey,
          blending ancient wisdom and practices with modern science to quiet the
          mind and open the heart for optimal wellness."

          "More than a book, The Peaceful Warrior's Path is a manual for optimal
          living and decision-making. It is lovingly offered by George
          Pitagorsky, who has spent 40 years developing practical applications
          for mindful living."

          book exceeded my expectation. George artfully and skillfully blends
          age-old philosophy and proven techniques while holding the reader's
          feet to the ground with practical exercises. I'd recommend this book
          first and foremost to those who are convinced they have no time to
          read such a book."
