          &nbsp;<br />
          <i>The Sun My Heart</i> is one of Thich Nhat Hanh’s most beloved
          books. Using the objects and events of everyday life in his hermitage
          in Plum Village—the gradual settling of the pulp in a glass of apple
          juice or the wind blowing into the room and scattering papers
          about—Thich Nhat Hanh draws from Buddhist psychology, epistemology,
          and the world of contemporary literature and science to guide the
          reader along the path of clarity and understanding.<br /><br />
          This book can be read straight through, but is also designed to be
          opened randomly and experienced chapter by chapter, paragraph by
          paragraph. Thich Nhat Hanh suggests in the introduction that
          <i>The Sun My Heart</i> “prefers to be a friend rather than a book.
          You can take it with you on the bus or subway as you do your coat or
          your scarf. It can give you small moments of joy at any time.”

          to be the antidote to our modern pain and sorrows. Here is a
          monumental, life-giving mind, preserved as textual force. And that's
          what I feel reading and practicing his teachings: that I am being
          acted on by a compassion equal to and pervasive as gravity
          itself.&nbsp;His books help me be more human,

          soothing rain in dry heat. Ever since, for more than fifty years, he
          has been the conscience of humanity. He has been a compassionate
          catalyst of spiritual awakening, social harmony and ecological
          awareness. He has nurtured the human spirit with dedication,
          determination and delight. He is humble and gentle yet powerfully

        </h4>
        <p>
          Thich Nhat Hanh was a world-renowned spiritual teacher and peace
          activist. Born in Vietnam in 1926, he became a Zen Buddhist monk at
          the age of sixteen. Over seven decades of teaching, he published more
          than 100 books, which have sold more than four million copies in the
          United States alone. Exiled from Vietnam in 1966 for promoting peace,
          his teachings on Buddhism as a path to social and political
          transformation are responsible for bringing the mindfulness movement
          to Western culture. He established the international Plum Village
          Community of Engaged Buddhism in France, now the largest Buddhist
          monastery in Europe and the heart of a growing community of
          mindfulness practice centers around the world. He passed away in 2022
          at the age of 95 at his root temple, Tu Hieu, in Hue, Vietnam.
