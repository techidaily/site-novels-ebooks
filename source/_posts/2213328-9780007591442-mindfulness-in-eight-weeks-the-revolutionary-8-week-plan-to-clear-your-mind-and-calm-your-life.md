            Find your way into Mindfulness with this engaging and practical
            step-by-step guide that you can follow in your own time and in the
            comfort of your own home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mindfulness training can change your life: recommended by the UK’s
            National Institute for Health and Excellence and prescribed by the
            NHS, it helps you to experience less stress and anxiety, and to
            discover more joy and deeper sense of being in each moment. In just
            eight weeks, people who have learnt these simple and easy-to-follow
            methods describe how it gives them new zest for life and an
            increased courage to face whatever obstacles they come across.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michael Chaskalson is an expert instructor. His forty years of
            practical experience with Mindfulness have enabled him to create a
            do-it-yourself programme that brings a fresh ease to practising.
            Endorsed by bestselling author in the field, Mark Williams, this
            course is a unique hybrid of the two most popular approaches:
            Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-Based
            Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Broken down into eight week segments with
            step-by-step instructions carefully coordinated for each,
            Mindfulness in Eight Weeks also comes with audio materials available
            to download to support home practice, making this book as near as
            you can get to being a participant on a teacher-led mindfulness
            course without actually joining one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simple, supportive and highly recommended, this is THE revolutionary
            8 week plan to detox, de-stress and de-clutter your mind.
