            >(Originally published as <i>DEFY GRAVITY</i>)
            <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Caroline Myss investigates
            the mystical phenomenon of healing and the presence of grace in
            every life.</b
          ><br /><br /><i
            >What is grace? How does grace work? How do I know if I've ever had
            an experience of grace in my life?</i
          >
          For decades, readers and students have turned to medical intuitive
          Caroline Myss for answers to these essential questions. In these
          pages, she takes readers on a transformative journey to investigate
          the "holy authority" of grace and find tools to heal themselves and
          their lives.<br /><br />Originally published as <i>Defy Gravity</i>,
          this searching and eloquent book offers a message that we need now
          more than ever. Inspired by ordinary people who overcame a wide array
          of physical and psychological ailments, Caroline dove into the works
          of the great mystics to gain a deeper understanding of healing's
          spiritual underpinnings. Using what she discovered, she invites us
          into an intimate and healing engagement with the soul, which we
          experience through exploring our seven shadow passions, building an
          empowered inner self around our seven inherent graces, and learning
          how to work with the mystical laws that govern it.<br /><br />With
          this knowledge, you can break through the boundaries of ordinary
          reason. You can heal from illness, heartbreak, and pain. You can learn
          to live fearlessly. And you can start to discern the guidance of grace
          in every moment of your life.

          “It is rare that an author and teacher as accomplished and influential
          as Caroline Myss would, with each book, discover whole new vistas, and
          then report back to us with her legendary clarity and passion.
          With&nbsp;<i>A Time for Grace</i>&nbsp;she has done it again. Anyone
          in need of healing—healing from illness, anxiety, fear, or
          heartbreak—will find enormous help in this book. It is a tonic made of
          light and wisdom.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Elizabeth Lesser</b>, co-founder,
          Omega Institute and author of&nbsp;<i
            >Broken Open: How Difficult Times Can Help Us Grow</i
          ><br /><br />“In&nbsp;<i>A Time for Grace</i>, Caroline Myss offers a
          new model of transformation and healing that will shift how we
          perceive crisis and illness. A must-read.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b
            >Deepak Chopra</b
          >, author of&nbsp;<i>The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success</i
          ><br /><br />“Caroline has been one of my most important spiritual
          teachers. In her new book, she continues to pierce both hearts and
          minds with arrows of truth.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Marianne Williamson</b>,
          author of&nbsp;<i>The Age of Miracles</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i
            >A Return to Love</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>A Time for Grace</i>&nbsp;is a powerful look at the
          mystical aspects of the process of deep healing. The extraordinary
          Caroline Myss provides profound insights into the nature of illness
          and the healing miracles that can occur. What I love about Caroline is
          that she isn’t afraid to make waves and go way beyond convention to
          create new paradigms of health.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Judith Orloff, M.D.</b
          >, author of&nbsp;<i>Emotional Freedom</i><br /><br />“In this time of
          extraordinary evolutionary upheaval, Caroline Myss offers a powerful
          and wise prescription for self-healing that transforms and empowers
          the reader to gain sovereignty over their physical, emotional, and
          spiritual well-being.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Bruce H. Lipton, Ph.D.</b>,
          author of&nbsp;<i>The Biology of Belief</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i
            >Spontaneous Evolution</i
          ><br /><br />“In&nbsp;<i>A Time for Grace</i>&nbsp;Caroline Myss goes
          far beyond conventional thinking to describe with precision those
          areas of experience, those mystical and mysterious events that
          ultimately account for illness. I found this book to be
          extraordinarily intelligent and perceptive in charting ways to go deep
          into the soul to glimpse those faint issues that grow into large
          problems.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Thomas Moore</b>, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Care of the Soul </i
          >and&nbsp;<i>Writing in the Sand</i><br /><br />“Like no other author,
          Myss invariably manages to help us reach yet an even higher level of
          understanding of how to heal. Run, don’t walk, and buy this
          book.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Mona Lisa Schulz, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, author
          of&nbsp;<i>The Intuitive Advisor</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i
            >Heal Your Mind</i
          ><br /><br />“In this book, Caroline Myss reminds us that, while we
          should be grateful for the gift of reason, we should also be aware
          that the mystery and holiness of life cannot be found in the dim light
          of reason alone. As&nbsp;<i>A Time for Grace</i>&nbsp;makes clear, the
          mystics teach that there is in each of us the capacity for mystical
          experience that transcends reason. Each chapter of this book echoes
          with the expansive energy of mystical awakening and offers ways we can
          cultivate this awakening in our lives.”&nbsp;—<b

            >The Contemplative Heart</i
          ><br /><br />“Caroline Myss is the most outstanding voice in the field
          of spirituality and healing alive on the planet today. In&nbsp;<i
            >A Time for Grace</i
          >&nbsp;she challenges some of our culture’s most cherished myths about
          healing, inviting the reader to exit the prison of reason and enter
          the ‘field of grace’ from which miracles spontaneously arise.
          Translating universal spiritual wisdom into modern language, Caroline
          illuminates the journey to empowering both psyche and
          soul.”&nbsp;—&nbsp;<b>Joan Borysenko, Ph.D.</b>, author of&nbsp;<i
