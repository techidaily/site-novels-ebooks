          <i>Core Light Healing</i> you will discover:<br /><br />· The nature
          of the creative process from the Human Energy Consciousness
          perspective<br />· How each of us creates blocks in our energy fields;
          how blocks look, interact, and ultimately cause dysfunction in our
          lives; and the process involved in the clearing of blocks and
          releasing our creative potential<br />· How to develop and work with
          High Sense Perception and its role in facilitating the clearing of
          blocks in our energy fields<br />· The nature of fourth-level reality
          and its vital role in the creative process<br />· The fourth level as
          it relates to healing relationships and the cord connections that
          underlie those relationships<br />· And much more<br /><br />Complete
          with full-color and black-and-white illustrations,
          <i>Core Light Healing</i> offers to take you on a journey to create
          the life you have always imagined.

          “I’ve been a fan of Barbara Brennan’s work for over 25 years—she has
          touched thousands with her healing gift. In <i>Core Light Healing</i>,
          Barbara has created the essential healing guide—a fascinating read for
          anyone seeking to understand the role that energy plays in mental,
          physical, and spiritual health and to free themselves from destructive
          patterns and suppressed trauma that prevent them from living their
          very best life.”<br />— <b>James Van Praagh</b>,
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>The Power of Love</i
          ><br /><br />“Books like <i>Core Light Healing </i>show up in your
          life—like people you love—as acts of destiny! Barbara Ann Brennan is a
          NASA-trained physicist and an extraordinary mystic. She’s here to take
          you on a mind-altering, heart-opening journey into the cosmos and your
          divine nature. Let’s go!”<br />— <b>Robert Holden</b>, author of
          <i>Holy Shift!</i> and <i>Life Loves You</i><br /><br />“To know
          Barbara Brenna is to know her ‘core light healing’ work. She is a
          delightful person, fellow-teacher, and friend. She lives the life of
          spirit and brings the ‘magic’ and discipline of the healer to
          everything she does. We’ve known Barbara for over 40 years. When we
          first met, she was a brainy blond NASA scientist. Not long after, she
          revealed herself on deeper levels as she entered another world—the
          world of the heart and healing.”<br />— <b>Bert and Moira Shaw</b>,

        </h4>
        <p>
          Barbara Ann Brennan, founder and president of the Barbara Brennan
          School of Healing, has been researching the Human Energy Field for
          more than 35 years. Her best-selling books—Hands of Light® and Light
          Emerging—are considered classics in the fields of energy work and
          complementary medicine. Her work has resulted in the development of
          Brennan Healing Science, a holistic healing modality based on the
          Human Energy-Consciousness System and its relationship to health and
          disease. This work touches every aspect of a person’s life to improve
          the quality of life. A former NASA physicist, Barbara Ann Brennan
          holds advanced degrees in philosophy and theology as well as physics.
          Before she retired from teaching, she and her faculty trained over
          3,000 graduates in the four-year Brennan Healing Science Professional
          Studies and Bachelor of Science programs as well as teacher training
          and integration work programs. The school continues her work and
          celebrates its 35th anniversary in 2017. Website:
