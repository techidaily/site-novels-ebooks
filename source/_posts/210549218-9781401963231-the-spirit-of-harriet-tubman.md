            >Within these visionary pages, meditation and dharma teacher Spring
            Washam meets the spirit of one of America's greatest ancestors,
            Harriet Tubman.</b
          ><br /><br />The Spirit of Harriet Tubman, who was called the Moses of
          her people, is rising again, and we can call forth her spirit to
          embody incredible strength and unwavering courage. Combining direct
          transmissions of Harriet's message with insightful explorations of her
          life and legacy, this extraordinary book gives us support and
          inspiration to deepen our roots of resilience and become powerful
          conductors of love and truth in our own lives.<br /><br />We are in
          the midst of another civil rights revolution and a movement of the
          heart is underway. Each chapter of this book examines a different
          facet of Harriet's prophetic life with teachings on how her lessons
          can be applied to what is happening in our world today. Whether we
          need to focus on cultivating supportive practices for ourselves, or on
          developing skills to engage more broadly with what is unfolding in the
          larger world, the inspiring story of Harriet Tubman can support us as
          we respond to this unprecedented time. We can learn how to remain
          fearless in the face of hatred and confusion. And through Harriet
          Tubman's guidance, we will learn how to meet the challenges of this
          moment with a compassionate heart.<br /><br />Spring's previous works
          have been praised by <i>Publishers Weekly</i> as "bring[ing]
          considerable gifts for conveying her vision of personal change and
          offer[ing] vivid, inspiring testimony to the power of Buddhism." And
          now, she inspires a new generation of activists to carry her message
          and her work forward.

          Wow! An extraordinary and inspiring story, one of power and heart.
          Read this and Harriet will touch your spirit and change you for the
          good. - Jack Kornfield, author of A Path with Heart<br /><br />A
          powerful and astonishing book on the liberator Harriet Tubman, whose
          courage and vision, determination, and love will light the underground
          of our lives. Spring Washam brings to us her life and Harriet's in a
          voice that is both beautiful and courageous. - Roshi Joan Halifax,
          Abbot, Upaya Zen Center<br /><br />Mother Harriet, as an awakened
          bodhisattva, knows that real freedom is realizing the essence of
          everything, and to do that, our abolition practice must also be a
          spiritual practice where we are allying with the unseen world of
          beings who are working alongside us to get us and everything free. . .
          . In this text Spring has consented to allow Mother Harriet to speak
          through her to offer to the world a vital message of hope as well as a
          call to action. - Lama Rod Owens
