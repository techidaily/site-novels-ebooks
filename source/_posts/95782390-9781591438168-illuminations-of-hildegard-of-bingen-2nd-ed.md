          An introduction to the life and work of Hildegard. <br /><br />•
          Reveals the life and teachings of one of the greatest female artists
          and intellectuals of the Western Mystical Tradition. <br /><br />•
          Contains 24 full-color illustrations by Hildegard of Bingen.
          <br /><br />• Includes commentary by Matthew Fox, author of
          <i>Original Blessing</i> (250,000 sold). <br /><br />Hildegard of
          Bingen (1098-1179) was an extraordinary woman living in the Rhineland
          valley during most of the twelfth century. Besides being the abbess of
          a large and influential Benedictine abbey, she was a prominent
          preacher, healer, scientist, and artist. She also was a composer and
          theologian, writing nine books on theology, medicine, science, and
          physiology, as well as 70 poems and an opera. At the age of 42, she
          began to have visions; these were captured as 36 illuminations--24 of
          which are recorded in this book along with her commentaries on them.
          She also wrote a text describing these visions entitled
          <i>Scivias</i> (Know the Ways), now published as
          <i>Hildegard of Bingen's Mystical Visions</i>. <br /><br />Author
          Matthew Fox has stated, "If Hildegard had been a man, she would be
          well known as one of the greatest artists and intellectuals the world
          has ever seen." It is a credit to the power of the women's movement
          and our times that this towering genius of Western thought is being
          rediscovered in her full grandeur and autonomy. <br /><br />Virtually
          unknown for more than 800 years in Western history, Hildegard was
          featured as one of the women in Judy Chicago's <i>Dinner Party</i> in
          the early 1980s and published for the first time in English by Bear
          &amp; Company in 1982. In addition to her mystical teachings,
          Hildegard's music has been performed and recorded for a new and
          growing audience.

          "We find relatively few Christian guides in the past to enlighten or
          to inspire us to a more functional relationship between the human and
          the natural worlds. . . . Hildegard might be considered a model with
          her sense of the earth as region of delight. . . . She has reached far
          into the emotionally exciting aspects of nature in a unique mode of
          Christian communion. She sees the creation maker in the ancient manner
          of the fertility cults, a view she expresses in her statement that
          creation and creator are related as woman and man. Only thus is the
          earth fruitful. . . . Because of this 'erotic' bond the earth becomes
          luxuriant in its every aspect."
