          • Shares Tom’s profound teachings on life, death, and unconditional
          love gained through his near-death experiences and direct encounter
          with the Light <br /><br />• Includes more than 160 true and
          remarkable stories about Tom completing his mission to spread God’s
          Unconditional Love <br /><br />• Details Tom’s death experiences and
          how in 2007, when he felt he had fulfilled his mission from God, he
          consciously left life on Earth <br /><br />In the early evening of May
          23, 1978, while making repairs under his pick-up truck full of
          firewood, the heavy truck crashed down on Tom Sawyer, crushing his
          chest flat. A 33-year-old Olympic-trained bike racer and mechanic, Tom
          was clinically dead. Fifteen minutes later, he came back to life,
          recounting his strange experience of going through a tunnel, having
          his life review, and meeting the Light. <br /><br />Spiritually
          energized by this experience and endowed with supernatural abilities,
          Tom demonstrated repeatedly that the reality we believe in is an
          illusion, that walls are not necessarily barriers, severe health
          challenges can be healed in a moment, and it is possible to walk on
          water. During his death experience, Tom was charged by God with a
          three-part mission: teach that death does not exist, prevent nuclear
          war, and promote the Order of Melchizedek, in which he became a highly
          respected teacher. <br /><br />Through more than 160 remarkable
          stories, Rev. Daniel Chesbro and Rev. James B. Erickson share Tom’s
          profound and enlightening insights on life, death, and Unconditional
          Love. The most complete and in-depth account of the life and teachings
          of Tom Sawyer, this book reveals Tom as a modern-day messenger of God
          who returned to life a powerful conduit of Unconditional Love,
          compelled to create positive change for humanity.
