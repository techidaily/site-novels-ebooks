            <b>Inhale: Peace Exhale: Bullsh*t</b><br /><br />Who said meditation
            has to be so serious? Yogi Bryan has spent years honing his craft
            and cutting the crap in order to make meditation accessible for
            everyone, even when you think you don’t have the time or patience to
            meditate.<br /><br />Whether you can’t sit still or can’t stop your
            mind from wandering, Yogi Bryan will help you achieve mental clarity
            so you can manifest your wildest dreams. In as little as five
            minutes a day, you can establish a practice that not only relieves
            stress and calms anxiety, but has also proven to boost your physical
            health as well. Once you have the basics down, you can discover the
            power of breath patterns, postures, affirmations, mantras and more
            to unlock your self-confidence and higher calling.<br /><br />With
            the support of Yogi Bryan, meditation has never been more
            approachable or easier to work into your daily routine. If you’ve
            ever felt like meditation just wasn’t for you—or if you’ve always
            wanted to try it, but have been too intimidated—then buckle up,
            buttercup. Your journey starts here.

          “<i>It’s Just F*cking Meditation </i>is an artfully written extension
          of the realness, sarcasm and cussing that has brought Yogi Bryan to
          the forefront of the next generation of meditation. He meets you
          exactly where you are at with the supportive insight you need to
          start—and maintain—a meditation practice.” <br />—Ashton August,
          founder of YouAligned.com <br /><br />"Bryan's approach to meditation
          is refreshingly engaging and insightful. This book is a must-read for
          anyone seeking a less conventional, more joyful pathway to
          mindfulness."<br />—Taz Rashid, movement and meditation musician
          <br /><br />“Yogi Bryan will have you laughing, crying and in a deep
          state of meditation (maybe all at the same time). Your journey down
          the rabbit hole starts now!”<br />—Pedro Luna, co-founder of Next
          Level Yoga Academy<br /><br />"This book is sure to make you laugh,
          cry and maybe even allow you to stop taking yourself so seriously."
          <br />—Anton Wisbiski, entrepreneur and author<br /><br />“Yogi Bryan
          is unapologetically authentic. His teachings are real, practical and
          effective. This raw and hilarious book teaches us how to embrace our
          messy and beautiful humanness.” <br />—Sarah Ezrin, award-winning
          author of <i>The Yoga of Parenting</i><br /><br />“Yogi Bryan has
          crafted the perfect meditation book for those of us who have struggled
          for years with developing a meditation practice. Not only does he make
          it simple to understand meditation, he also provides easy ways to
          start and stay consistent.”<br />—Nate Palmer, bestselling author of
          <i>The Million Dollar Body Method</i>
