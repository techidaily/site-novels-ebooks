            THE DREAMOSOPHY APPROACH: In addition to helping you remember your
            dreams, this guidebook by dream educators Paul Sheldon and Elizabeth
            Eagar is all about making your dreams your own, rather than just
            being there. It’s about being free in your dreams and understanding
            and realizing your dreams. Many people go to bed and have a dream
            without remembering it. In many instances, they are really missing
            out on some of the cool things and some of the lessons and deeper
            experiences that can come up in dreams. The five basic Dream
            Opportunities, which are discussed in more detail throughout each
            chapter of this guidebook, include: How to be free in your dreams;
            How to feel good in your dreams; How to speak up in your dreams; How
            to make friends in your dreams; How to understand and realize your
            dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each Dream Opportunity is divided into three parts–noticing,
            identifying, and transforming or changing, to help you deepen and
            expand your experience of your dreams in a manner that is steady but
            slow enough not to cause too much strain for you. You will monitor
            your dreams for a week and write down how you feel in each of the
            dreams. By asking questions about how you feel, you can start to
            notice a few patterns. Then you are invited to identify these same
            feelings in your waking life, to invest time identifying the
            feelings that you have on most days and comparing them to your dream
            life. At this point, you still aren’t taking any actions, just
            noticing the patterns. Finally, you will be invited to explore
            transformation, to shift some aspects of how you experience your
            daily life. The aspiration is to recognize patterns in your dream
            life and your waking life, and then consider what it would be like
            to make changes in your waking life. This guidebook goes into more
            depth about how these three levels work and what you can do with
            them based on the Dream Opportunity in each chapter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The authors’&nbsp;ultimate aspiration is to invite people to become
            Dreambassadors – spokespersons for the value of dreaming – an
            opportunity that allows you to interact with others, who may need or
            want help with the different aspects of their dreams, so they can
            get the most out of their waking and dream lives.
