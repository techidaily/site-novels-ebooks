          A guide to the ancient Japanese art of working with concentrated
          life-force energy, seiki, for self-healing, revitalization, and
          creativity <br />
          <br />• Explains how to awaken seiki, guiding you through the stages
          of seiki development <br />
          <br />• Details how to develop your own daily practice for
          self-healing and renewal as well as providing exercises to infuse your
          everyday activities with seiki <br />
          <br />• Includes many inspiring stories from the authors’ decades of
          healing work <br />
          <br />Seiki jutsu is the ancient Japanese shamanic art of working with
          seiki, concentrated life-force energy, for self-healing,
          revitalization, creativity, and inspiration. Known in Tantra as
          <i>kundalini</i> and to the Kalahari Bushmen as <i>n/om</i>, seiki has
          been called “activated and strengthened chi” and is often described as
          a “non-subtle” energy because it is strongly felt when awakened.
          Centering on spontaneity of movement to gather and transmit seiki, the
          practice of seiki jutsu does not require years of training or endless
          memorization of forms. Once you have received seiki, your daily
          practice will teach you to activate the flow of this powerful energy
          to recharge your body, mind, and spirit and empower you to find your
          unique destiny. <br />
          <br />Renowned seiki jutsu masters Bradford and Hillary Keeney detail
          the history and lineage of seiki jutsu beginning in 8th-century Japan
          and reveal how this ancient practice was used by the samurai. The
          authors show how seiki underlies the “flow experience” sought after by
          artists, musicians, athletes, and performers of all types. They
          explain how to recognize the awakening of seiki, guiding you through
          the stages of seiki development with stories of healings they have
          participated in or witnessed. They reveal how to develop your own
          daily practice for self-healing and renewal as well as provide active
          exercises to discover your life’s purpose, infuse your everyday
          activities with seiki, and motivate yourself to create a fulfilling
          life. They show that no method of performance, spiritual practice, or
          philosophy of life can fully awaken unless you are instilled with
          sufficient seiki. Regarded in Japan as “the fountain of youth,” seiki
          jutsu provides a way to bring maximum vitality into every aspect of
          life.
