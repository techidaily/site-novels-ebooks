          <b>Heal yourself through the power of water and goodwill<br /></b
          ><br />Masaru Emoto’s extensive years spent studying the power and
          potential of water have provided him with the knowledge to discuss its
          properties; its role in the creation of the universe and all of life;
          and why a perfect ratio of love and gratitude can usher in a new age
          of happiness, well-being, and peace on Earth.<br /><br />This
          cutting-edge book offers us proof that our prayers, goodwill, and
          positive words can heal us . . . as well as the planet. Through his
          fascinating accounts and stunning photographs, Emoto reveals the
          urgent messages from water and reminds us that the essence of life
          (and our own potential) lies in the love and gratitude we hold within
          our hearts.

          “I love Masaru Emoto’s work with water. It is so pure and simple. It’s
          a perfect example of how our thoughts affect our bodies and our world.
          Say loving words to water and it smiles; be angry at water and it
          shrivels. Since we are mostly made up of water, can you imagine how
          our minds and bodies react to the thoughts and words we use? As Dr.
          Emoto says, ‘All the answers are in water.’”<br />— <b>Louise Hay</b>,
          <i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling author of
          <i>You Can Heal Your Life<br /><br /></i>“Masaru Emoto, whose name is
          already synonymous with water and the memory and sensitivity of water,
          wrote a message from the depths of his heart. He knows that there is
          much confusion in the world and that we need to know more about the
          true nature of the universe and the essence of living; and he finds
          answers in and through water. Dr. Emoto sees a new consciousness
          arising and wishes to contribute to it—he pledges to walk the world as
          a water missionary, at least until the critical period at the end of
          the year 2012. His book and his message areheartwarming, and merit
          being taken to heart.”<br />— <b>Ervin Laszlo, Ph.D.</b>, the
          best-selling author of <i>CosMos </i>and <i>The Akashic Experience</i
          ><br /><br />“In his extraordinary books, Dr. Masaru Emoto has long
          pioneered what frontier science has only recently begun to address:
          the unique ability of water to record our thoughts and intentions.
          This deceptively simple work holds enormous ramifications not only for
          healing human beings, but also for healing the planet.”<br />—
          <b>Lynne McTaggart</b>, author of the international bestsellers
          <i>The Intention Experiment </i>and <i>The Field<br /><br /></i>“Dr.
          Emoto has done it again! His newest work,
          <i>Messages from Water and the Universe</i>, catapults us into a
          powerful, new, and holistic way of thinking of ourselves in the world!
          In doing so, he bridges the science of the future with the present by
          showing us how the world is a reflection of our experiences—the
          universal code of life showing us the path to healing, peace, and joy.
          This book gives our minds the reasons to accept what our hearts
          intuitively know. We are part of all that exists, and our everyday
          choices have consequences that extend beyond the obvious. While there
          is much more to learn about our messages from the universe, we can
          apply what we know today to help us become better people, and to
          create a better world!”<br />— <b>Gregg Braden</b>, the
          <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of
          <i>The Divine Matrix</i> and <i>Fractal Time<br /><br /></i>“Masaru
          Emoto, famous for his groundbreaking work
          <i>The Hidden Messages in Water</i>, expands his studies with an
          experimental and philosophical foray into the formative powers of
          <i>kotodama</i>, Japanese for the ‘spirit of words.’ Emoto takes us on
          a journey from ancient Shintoism to the microscopic realm of
          crystallized water on his quest to understand how the vibrations of
          words shape everything from water to our health and life experiences.
          His personal insights offer a novel, thought-provoking look into the
          conscious use of words and intention in manifesting our world.”<br />—

          author of <i>The Biology of Belief</i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          Masaru Emoto was born in Japan in July 1943. In 1992 he received a
          certification from the Open International University as a doctor of
          alternative medicine. He began to discover the mystery of water as he
          learned the concept of micro cluster water and Magnetic Resonance
          Analysis technology. He has gained worldwide acclaim through his
          groundbreaking research and discovery that water is deeply connected
          to our individual and collective consciousness. He is the author of
          the best-selling books Message from Water, The Hidden Messages in
          Water, and The True Power of Water.
