            <strong>Ethos </strong>helps you develop the personal traits that
            are revered in your community. Such traits include: honesty,
            responsibility, fairness, and respect. Without incorporating these
            traits into your character, without being kind or contributing to
            your community, one will not be able to have a happy life and a
            regenerated natural environment. The achievement of such
            characteristics is the purpose for reading <strong>Ethos.</strong>
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            After the four interesting and helpful preparatory books in
            Heartwood Path, Part One<strong>, Ethos </strong>is the first of
            three books devoted to guiding you on your spiritual journey as an
            individual. You will learn about the useful natural laws (different
            from universal laws printed in earlier Heartwood Path books) that
            will affect your safe and effective progress through the stages of
            your life cycle.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            These dictums include the Natural Law of Thankfulness (to receive
            what you want you have to be thankful for what you have), the
            Natural Law of Affection (the Creator's affection for what was
            created and it is that same divine fondness that enables you to
            reach the highest levels of growth and awareness), and Natural Laws
            of Determination, Desirability, and many others. Use these Natural
            Laws to build happiness for yourself as you serve in the cause of
            regenerating the natural environment.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            With the help of positive natural traits and guiding natural laws,
            the reader of <strong>Ethos</strong> is ready to learn about the
            continuous circling unfoldment of one's wheel of life, which, in
            sum, is anything but haphazard. If all goes well, one's life begins
            with ascent to Spirit and the search for belonging during one's
            youth and passes through descent to Soul and the search during one's
            adulthood for how best to serve the community of life before
            starting over again in another life after elderhood and death.

            Subjects included in <strong>Ethos</strong> are revealed in its
            thirty-three important prescriptions, which include:&nbsp;

            The Heartwood Path is unique and enjoyable course of study that
            shows ways to simultaneously bring about increased personal
            happiness and a regenerated local and global environment. Like all
            Heartwood Path books, <strong>Ethos</strong> uses eco-psychology,
            conservation psychology, and communing with nature to help
            participants reawaken to their bond with nature.&nbsp;
