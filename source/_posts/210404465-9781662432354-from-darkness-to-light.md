            This book is intended to be an encouragement to all readers that no
            matter how difficult life is, we can always trust the Lord and know
            that He will be there for us and help us through tough times. As you
            read my story, you will see that I had a very difficult childhood
            with abuse and a self-destructing young adulthood with alcoholism
            and constant fighting. However, with God’s help I was able to run
            away from darkness and find shelter in His mercy. Throughout my life
            I have had a lot of fear, sadness, and depression because of my
            father’s abuse, but God was always there with me. Although during my
            childhood I did not believe in God, now I know that He protected me
            all the time. I could have died many times due to the abuse, but I
            am still alive. When I learned about God and accepted Him as my
            personal Savior, my life took a 180 degree turn for the better. From
            a drunkard and a street fighter I became a sincere Christian who
            loves everybody. God also blessed me with a wonderful wife, and I am
            so thankful for that. I cannot praise the Lord enough for all the
            things that He has done for me. With the Lord’s help I was able to
            overcome the difficulties. I did it and you can do it, too! Just
            believe in Jesus as your personal Savior, and you will see the
            positive changes in your life.
