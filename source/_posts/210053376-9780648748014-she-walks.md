            WHAT IF - there are no mistakes or wrong turns in life. &nbsp;WHAT
            IF – the path you walk in life is not always what it would seem, and
            yet, exactly how it should be. &nbsp;Walk With Me - find your hidden
            magic, awaken the Human Spirit, it’s time to remember the
            magnificence of who you are, and have always been.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;<br />Karen's field of vision has been inspired by both
            adventure and exploration within the field of Mind, Body &amp;
            Spirit, People &amp; Place, Archaeology &amp; Architecture.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            She Walks in the footprints of:<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ancient
            civilisations, &nbsp;<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sacred landscape,<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;Sacred structure, &nbsp;<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sacred
            geometry,<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Earth sciences,&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;Indigenous cultures&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Our connection to the lived environment inspired her interest into
            the nature of the Human Spirit and how our human signature links
            into sacred structure and its function within the nature of
            existence. &nbsp;In her quest to understand the sacred aspect of
            earth systems and how they may be linked to the ancient way of
            perceiving reality, her travels have taken her on a global journey
            of cultural significance throughout the ancient and modern world.
            This led to Karen undertaking an Honours degree in archaeology at
            JCU University in Cairns, Australia. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;
            &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Karen's lived experience has led her to recognise
            that the function of the ancient architect or artist was to express
            in material form an insight into a higher spiritual reality.
            &nbsp;Within the footprints of ancient civilisations such insights
            become available to others through the forgotten skills that once
            shaped the vibration, the symbolism and the structure of sacred form
            and its function.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Further study of sacred
            structure and monumental temples has led Karen to explore the
            patterns and sequences of the sound of stone and its relationship
            within the function of earth systems. &nbsp;The same systems
            connected to the divine feminine principles, and functioning within
            every aspect of ancient earth once connected to the Goddess culture
            of prehistory, a period where no evidence of weapons or warfare have
            been found.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Global trends and growing demands threaten our future source of
            empowerment. Developing and developed countries are experiencing
            rapid demographic changes due to population growth, extreme climatic
            conditions and earth movements. &nbsp;Within our habitat their
            remains an urgent need to explore our connectedness to the
            archaeological evidence of sacred form and its function as once
            carved into the living land by our ancestors. Within the concept of
            sacred geometry and quantum physics their lies a divine benevolent
            system of earth technology, ancient patterns of divine proportion
            and vibration transformed into intelligent systems designed to
            activate and enhance the balance of human consciousness. &nbsp;Walk
            with me as we are reminded once again of the true significance of
            the Human Spirit.<br />&nbsp;
