          and supported. This book is a reminder that we are never alone and are
          powerful beyond measure. - Rev. Gwen Russo, Awakening the
          SpiritPatricia writes with heartfelt clarity, and her book speaks to
          you at your core. She has undergone extraordinary life changes in a
          very short time, and she paves the way for you to make such beautiful
          changes too. Be prepared for grace and transformation! - Michael
          Alperstein, director of Lightworkers World online communityThe reader
          is sure to be intrigued and inspired as Rev. Patricia Brooks shares,
          with great warmth and openness, her journey of connecting to the
          golden beings. Patricia's personal story will lead the reader to
          appreciate the guidance shared by these angelic beings and remind us
          that, with an open heart, we too may encounter such experiences. The
          author opens our eyes to a remarkable world of light and love. What a
          gift! ~Rev. Lynette Turner, Positivoligistâ„¢God is in the Little
          Things: Messages from the Golden Angels exposes the illusion of the
          physical world's darkness of fear with the brilliance of spiritual
          light. It reveals the key to experiencing our version of heaven on
          earth: ascending our energetic vibration to that of love by facing and
          healing the pain of the past. This is not just one woman's story. It's
          my story and it's your story-a story of ascension in human words
          supported by the energy of love. It's a revelation that when we tap
          into our inner wisdom and muster our strength from deep within, we can
          heal the fear that has held us hostage for lifetimes. Are you ready to
          expand into the light of your spiritual essence? Patricia's message
          will support your ability to do it, even though you may be afraid. Her
          path will validate that yes, your experiences are real! If you're
          actively ascending and expanding your conscious awareness, Patricia's
          message will nourish you with renewed resilience! I highly recommend
          Messages from the Golden Angels. ~Kate Large, best-selling author,
