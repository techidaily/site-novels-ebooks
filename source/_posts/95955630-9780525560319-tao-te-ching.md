            >The original mindfulness book, in a landmark new translation by the
            award-winning translator of the <i>I Ching </i>and
            <i>The Art of War</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The most translated book in the world after the Bible, the
          <i>Tao Te Ching,</i> or “Book of the Tao,” is a guide to cultivating a
          life of peace, serenity, and compassion. Through aphorisms and
          parable, it leads readers toward the Tao, or the “Way”: harmony with
          the life force of the universe. Traditionally attributed to Lao-tzu, a
          Chinese philosopher thought to have been a contemporary of Confucius,
          it is the essential text of Taoism, one of the three major religions
          of ancient China. As one of the world’s great works of wisdom
          literature, it still has much to teach us today, offering a practical
          model based on modesty and self-restraint for living a balanced
          existence and for opening your mind, freeing your thoughts, and
          attaining greater self-awareness. With its emphasis on calm,
          simplicity, purity, and non-action, it provides a time-tested refuge
          from the busyness of modern life.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This new translation seeks to understand the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> as a
          guide to everyday living and encourages a slow, meditative reading
          experience. The <i>Tao Te Ching</i>’s eighty-one brief chapters are
          accompanied by illuminating commentary, interpretation, poems, and
          testimonials by the likes of Margaret Mead, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Dr.
          Wayne W. Dyer. Specially commissioned calligraphy for more than two
          hundred Chinese characters illustrates the book’s essential themes.

          “A lucid translation [by] one of the most famous translators of
          Chinese into English.” —<b><i>The New York Review of Books</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Ancient wisdom for those facing twenty-first-century
          perplexities . . . Minford writes for ordinary people seeking guidance
          in everyday life. . . . In simple but resonantly phrased language,
          [he] somehow does unfold [the <i>Tao</i>’s] message.” —<b
            ><i>Booklist, </i>starred review</b
          ><br /><br />“A wonderful translation—clear and deep.”&nbsp;—<b

              ><b
                ><b>Vikram Seth<br /><br /></b></b></b></b
          >“My first reaction as a Sinologist to a new translation of the
          <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is always: ‘Another one?! Whatever for?’ But then
          I began to read John Minford’s translation, and it immediately seduced
          me. . . . It has the mark of the craftsman: Its choice of words is not
          just judicious but also poetic, refreshing the at once limpid and
          ambiguous original and making it new. . . . The result is a
          metaphysical feast for those willing to slow down and read this text
          as it was meant to be read: meditatively.” —<b

                  >John Lagerwey, The Chinese University of Hong Kong<br /><br /></b></b></b></b
          >“A wonder and a delight. The simplicity and purity of this
          translation resonate directly with the original. It conveys the
          innermost essence of Chinese culture, drawing the reader deep into its
          enchantment and wisdom. Every word is charged with effortless energy—a
          radiant union of form and spirit.” —<b
            >Tang Yuen-ha, Chinese opera artist</b
          ><br /><br />“Meditative reading, known as <i>lectio divina,</i> is a
          Benedictine tradition going back a millennium and a half. John
          Minford, using the term <i>lectio Sinica,</i> has creatively suggested
          such an approach as an essential way to read the <i>Tao Te Ching.</i>”
          —<b>Nicholas Koss, Order of Saint Benedict</b><br /><br />“Elegant and
          poetic, John Minford’s translation of the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> probably
          comes the closest of any to the essence of the mystical, ineffable
          Taoist classic. Minford wisely avoids providing one authoritative
          voice, instead introducing a rich tapestry of historical resonances
          that induce a meditative experience, as if harmonizing with an
          ensemble singing an ancient song.” —<b
