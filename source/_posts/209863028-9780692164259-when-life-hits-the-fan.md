          <p>
            More than 44 million Americans provide care for family members and
            friends with chronic illness or conditions that require day to day
            assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, caregivers do this out of real compassion and love, or a
            sense of duty for the person they are caring for.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;Often they find themselves thrown into roles that are
            unfamiliar and sometimes scary; like managing through the medical
            and insurance system to gain the best possible care for their loved
            one or understanding the options in the middle of a medical
            emergency. Stress levels can go through the roof, and over time
            stress wreaks havoc on the caregiver as well as their loved one.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the caregiver also has a family, a job, and other
            responsibilities and caring for their loved one is added to their
            current roles. While it is a labor of love, it can be exhausting
            over time, and things start to fall through the cracks, including
            caring for their own health.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Life Hits the Fan shares the experiences of a number of
            caregivers and activities that they can do to take care of
            themselves, body and soul. The practices in the book come from the
            author’s training in mindfulness, emotional intelligence and
            positive psychology as well as her own caregiving journey. &nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            With a practical approach to stress reduction and easy to follow
            exercises, When Life Hits the Fan helps us understand what’s going
            on inside our minds and our bodies and ways to create resilience and
            care for ourselves.
