            The Ways of the Lonely Ones: A Collection of Mystical Allegories
            (1925) by Manly P. Hall is a series of stories written to bring the
            truths of the world to the reader's heart, rather than merely to
            their intellect and reason. These eight tales tell the stories of
            seemingly ordinary people whose mystical experiences change the
            course of their lives and guide them to deeper truths.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In the introduction, Hall writes, "Every individual who comes into
            the world is a Lonely One-a stranger in a strange land." The "Lonely
            Ones" of these stories are united in their search for greater
            understanding, as are the readers.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In "Nature's Homage," Manly tells the tale of the Old Man of the
            Mountain, the "hermit of the mighty peaks." This man's deep
            connection with nature leads him to care for the mountain animals,
            and in return they care for him, bringing him food. He shares his
            story with a youth who comes to the mountain to hunt, leading the
            young man to foreswear hunting forever and to take responsibility
            for the creatures of the mountain when the hermit is gone.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            "The Maker of Gods" shares the story of a potter who is blessed with
            the ability to mold gods from clay, which then come to life and go
            home to their Father. As word spreads of his great deeds, the potter
            is visited by many who come to watch him work. He explains, "'From
            the clay of the earth and all things earthy must man mold the gods
            of his dreams; from the sticks and stones which surround him he must
            form the wings to bear aloft his innermost ideals.'"
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The story of "The One Who Turned Back" reveals a pure and generous
            philosopher who stands at the curtain between humankind and
            immortality after a long life of toil and care for his fellow
            creatures. He is told he need no longer struggle in the mortal
            darkness. Instead, he can step into a greater Light with "new worlds
            to conquer, new duties, new sorrows and a fuller understanding." But
            called back to the world by the broken heart of humanity, he must
            choose between this higher plane and returning to help those still
            in despair.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            In "The Guardian of Light," a pilgrim wanders the earth for many
            years seeking an answer to the riddle of life. Spying a Light
            shining high atop a high peak, he climbs to the top where he finds
            an old man draped in flowing robes. The old man holds a mysterious
            flame, but he is weary. He shares the truth of the Light with the
            pilgrim, who chooses to relieve the old man of his burden and free
            him to hold his greater Light among the stars. But the task is a
            weary one, and the pilgrim must pass through failure and despair
            before he can truly hold the Light.
          </p>

            Manly P. Hall was just 21 years old when he wrote this impressive
            collection of allegories. Just three years earlier, he had moved
            from his native Canada to Los Angeles, where he quickly became a
            preacher at the Church of the People. This self-educated spiritual
            and mystical leader embarked on a 7-decade career of lectures,
            writings, and scholarship to share the truths of the greater
            universe. He wrote over 150 books and essays throughout his life,
            and gave a lecture at Carnegie Hall that set an attendance record in
            1942.

            In the 1930s, Hall founded the Philosophical Research Society in Los
            Angeles, dedicated to the study of metaphysics, religion, and
            mythology. Throughout his lifetime, he traveled extensively and
            collected many works of philosophy to add to its library. Still in
            operation today, the PRS has a substantial library of over 50,000
            volumes.&nbsp;
