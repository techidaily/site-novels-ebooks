          "How can an aardvark and a platypus help you change your life? How can
          #WWBWD help you make better decisions? And what does brewing coffee
          have to do with being healthier and happier? For the answers to these
          and other life-altering questions, look no further than Percolate,
          Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino’s masterwork. I highly recommend this book
          if you want to live more fully, laugh more heartily, and leave a
          lasting legacy for your loved ones!"<br />— Noah St. John,
          best-selling author of The Book of AFFORMATIONS®,
          www.NoahStJohn.com<br /><br />"For years I have enjoyed bringing
          clarity and joy into my life by taking time each morning to reflect on
          my blessings over a hot cup of coffee. Now I have a new favorite way
          to ‘percolate,’ thanks to this wonderful book! After following
          Elizabeth on The Best Ever Your Network, I am so happy that she has
          found a new way to share her inspirational message with us all!"<br />—
          Michelle Phillips, best-selling author of The Beauty Blueprint,
          www.MichellePhillips.com<br /><br />"Elizabeth shows us how to follow
          our hearts and have the courage to really be ourselves—that we’ve been
          percolating all along."<br />— Gary Kobat, international authority on
          integrative well-being<br /><br />"What amazing miracles have been
          percolating in your life that you might not realize, expect, or
          understand? Elizabeth and Katie will help you find out in Percolate.
          Enjoy the experience of letting your best self filter through!"<br />—
          Deb Scott, host of The Best People We Know Radio Show<br /><br />"I
          love the Java Jive, and it loves me . . . and I really love Percolate,
          a bold and flavorful blend of higher wisdom, experience, and common
          sense. Drink deep of this rich brew, and you’ll enjoy life to the
          fullest."<br />— Stephen Powers, Grammy Award–winning producer and

          gift—a marvelous one—filled with intelligence and beauty."<br />—
          Michael McGlone, actor<br /><br />"Courageously awaken and percolate
          your best self forward, and remember to put a fresh filter of
          unconditional love and light in each day."<br />— Debra Oakland,
          author and founder of Living in Courage<br /><br />"If you can’t wait
          to get your hands on another self-help book filled with dogma and
          strict directions, then Percolate isn’t for you. However, if you’ve
          been searching for a book that can brilliantly guide you to guide
          yourself, search no more."<br />— Gabe Berman, author of Live Like a
          Fruit Fly<br /><br />"Percolate is not another self-help book. It’s an
          invitation to sit down with Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino for a cup of
          java and a generous helping of real-life stories that just may shift
          something in your own life—it’s that powerful."<br />— Lisa Tener,
          award-winning book coach<br /><br />"Put down this book if you don’t
          want to do the work."<br />— Fred Cuellar, Diamond Cutters
          International<br /><br />"Just like the ingredients of an excellent
          cup of coffee, Percolate delivers the perfect blend of emotional
          energy, spiritual spice, and tremendously good taste. Elizabeth’s
          bubbly attitude and fresh perspective will leave you thirsty for
          more!"<br />— Sue Jacques, The Civility CEO®<br /><br />"It takes
          only moments to learn that Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino has a gift for
          connecting with people. She&nbsp;shares her own personal experiences,
          and those of others, in a way that challenges each of us to become our
          best. The stories in Percolate continue to express her inspirational
          spirit and will simply make you feel good."<br />— Sarah C. Bazey,
          Mrs. International 2012 and president and CEO of Simplex Construction
          Supplies, Inc.<br /><br />?"Percolate is the perfect title for
          Elizabeth’s book because anyone who knows her personality will agree
          that she is like a constant, contagious, and inspirational jolt of
          caffeine. This is a woman who lives every minute of every day to the
          fullest. Elizabeth’s cup runneth over, and if we can sip in just a
          little bit of her wisdom and experience, we should consider ourselves
          lucky!"<br />— Anthony Turk, Hollywood publicist<br /><br />"Elizabeth’s
          inspirational and caring spirit is reflected on each and every page of
          this book. A special thank-you to Elizabeth for guiding us on this
          journey to our best selves."<br />— Lisa Cocuzza, founder of It’s a
          Glam Thing<br /><br />"Are you happy? Are you living a life that you

          www.AllergyMoms.com<br /><br />"The No-Brainer Book of Big-Bean
          Changing! Your destiny reflects the choices you make. Your choices are
          the sum of your thinking, and your thoughts are infused with the
          meanings you attach to your words. So change the bean, change the
          brew: new meanings, new words, new thoughts, new choices, and—hey,
          presto—new destiny! Here’s to you being your own barista, percolating
          a rich, far-reaching aroma, stepping off the wheel and into the world

          Life Satisfaction<br /><br />"Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino is a mother,
          a businesswoman, and a fierce example of someone who takes life by the
          reins. She’s a positive example and yet still learning. Percolate is a
          beautiful compilation of insights she has gained over her journey to
          hopefully inspire, awaken, and evoke your personal best."<br />—
          Brianna Brown, actress and founder of The New Hollywood Women’s Goal
          Group<br /><br />"Elizabeth’s perseverance and courage amidst life’s

          charming, and uplifting. Percolate is a joy to read."<br />— Frank
          Dell’Amore, president, Dell’Amore® Premium Marinara Sauce<br /><br />"Percolate
          is compelling from the very first words. I couldn’t put it down, and I
          was moved to tears within the first few pages. Give yourself the
          delicious joy of journeying through this inspiring book with Elizabeth
          Hamilton-Guarino."<br />— Margaret Paul, Ph.D., author of Inner
          Bonding, www.innerbonding.com<br /><br />"If Betty White, Erma
          Bombeck, and Cheryl Richardson had a sister, it would most definitely
          be Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino. Simply put, Percolate flows, and you’ll
          love the feeling of expansion you get from reading it!"<br />— Pina De
          Rosa, Mindset Effectiveness Expert, www.PinaDeRosa.com<br /><br />"I

          www.SheaNetics.com and www.HealthyInitiative.org<br /><br />"A
          beautiful and, at the same time, no-holds-barred presentation of
          Elizabeth’s philosophy of life. This book befits a delightful author
          who speaks with the directness and humanity of one who, through
          personal experience, knows what really matters in life. Elizabeth has
          touched the lives of many with her work, and with this book, she will
          touch yours, too."<br />— David Fraser, Ph.D., executive coach and
          author of Relationship Mastery: A Business Professional’s Guide<br /><br />"I
          believe that in life, what we give, we get back. Who we surround
          ourselves with is who we are and what we stand for. I believe there is
          a little bit of superhero in all of us. Percolate, written by my dear
          friend Elizabeth Hamilton-Guarino, is the Ultimate Superhero Self-Help
          Book for the Soul. I was truly inspired and deeply moved by the book.
          . . . This is a must-read and will give you strength, knowledge, and
          the courage to grab your own superhero cape and fly!"<br />— Amy
