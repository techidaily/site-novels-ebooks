            >The best-selling guide to reading tarot from celebrated occultist
            and scholar Benebell Wen—history, practice, and 500+ illustrations
            and spreads</b
          ><br /><br />Designed for beginning as well as experienced tarot
          readers, <i>Holistic Tarot </i>offers a fresh and easy-to-follow
          approach to the use of the tarot deck for tapping into subconscious
          knowledge and creativity. The tarot deck has been used as a divination
          tool for more than two centuries; while the tarot is still most
          commonly thought of as "fortune telling," the true power of the tarot
          lies in its ability to channel a clear path for our deep intuition to
          shine through. Consulting the tarot can help clear creativity
          blockages, clarify ambitions, work through complex decisions, and make
          sense of emotions and relationships. Whether used for simple
          decision-making or an understanding of your life's purpose, learning
          tarot can be an indispensible tool for being more mindful of the
          factors that can assist or weaken your efforts toward success.<br /><br />
          In <i>Holistic Tarot</i>, author Benebell Wen provides a complete
          guide to using the tarot to foster personal development.&nbsp;Wen
          gives a comprehensive overview of&nbsp;the history of the tarot and a
          wide array of theories on its use (including its relationship to
          Jungian archetypal psychology and traditional Chinese divination
          practices) before digging deeply into&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;best-known
          tarot systems, the Rider-Waite-Smith.&nbsp;Beginners will find a
          complete guide to working with the tarot, including choosing and
          caring for a deck, how best to learn and remember the attributes of
          the major and minor arcana, the interpretation of cards and spreads,
          the role of meditation in a tarot practice, and how to use the tarot
          for improving relationships, professional development, and personal
          resilience. More advanced practitioners will appreciate nuanced
          theoretical discussions of the tarot as well as practical advice about
          reading others' tarot cards and setting up a practice. Containing over
          500 illustrations and detailed information on each card as well as
          numerous spreads, <i>Holistic Tarot</i> is a complete compendium of
          tarot study that every practitioner should have in their library.<br /><br /><i

          infused with Eastern thought, Western esotericism, and practical
