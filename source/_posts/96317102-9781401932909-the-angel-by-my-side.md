            >“Do your pet and yourself a favor: Buy this book, and when you’re
            done reading it, keep it in the medicine cabinet for the next time
            you need salve for your soul.” — Marty Becker, D.V.M., veterinary
            contributor for <i>Good Morning America</i>, chief veterinary
            correspondent for Amazon, and author of
            <i>The Healing Power of Pets</i><br /></b
          ><br />It was 1994, and Mike Lingenfelter was ready for his life to be
          over. Two serious heart attacks and open-heart surgery had taken away
          most of the good things that he had in his life. However, his doctors
          still held out hope for him, and they were trying to find ways to
          motivate him to get out of the house and exercise. <br /><br />Their
          vision was that an energetic dog on a leash might do that for Mike.
          And so it was that this golden retriever named Dakota, who had been
          rescued from death himself, came to help Mike with his rehabilitative
          therapy. Eventually, Dakota became Mike’s protector and his best
          friend, saving Mike’s life several times after somehow learning how to
          alert Mike of oncoming heart crises. Dakota gave Mike back his
          dignity, his pride, and his life. <br /><br />Early on, it became
          evident to Mike that this wonderful 98-pound, red-haired, four-legged
          angel had a special gift: Dakota was a spirit guide, and it was Mike’s
          duty to share him and the power of the human-animal bond. Ultimately,
          as part of that journey, one more miracle was needed, as Dakota fought
          a courageous and dignified battle for his own life.

          “The partnership between Mike and Dakota was astonishing, humbling,
          beyond description—and absolutely true. This remarkable story about a
          man and a dog has volumes to teach us about healing, devotion, and the
          mysterious and numinous bond of one soul to another. Must-reading for
          anyone who has ever loved—or been loved—by a dog. For skeptics of the
          human-animal bond, this book will make you a convert!” —

          magnificently showcases how, over the millennia, we’ve come to find
          our relationship with pets inextricably woven into not just our health
          and happiness, but our very survival. Nobody who reads this book will
          ever look at their own pets the same way again—they’re not pets,
          they’re life-support systems cleverly disguised as four-legged family
          members! Do your pet and yourself a favor: Buy this book, and when
          you’re done reading it, keep it in the medicine cabinet for the next
          time you need salve for your soul.” — <b>Marty Becker, D.V.M.</b>,

          comfortable chair and a box of tissues, and curl up with this book. As
          you read this remarkable story, you will come to believe in the
          human-animal bond, if you didn’t already.” —
