            The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion.
            Herein lies the germ of all art and all true science. Anyone to whom
            this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and
            lives in a state of fear, is a dead man. – Albert Einstein
          </p>
          <p>
            For millennia, mystics’ explorations of reality were considered a
            religious quest. This changed during the Victorian era, when
            researchers began redefining mystical experiences as psychological
            phenomena.
          </p>
          <p>
            No longer strictly religious, mystical experiences came to be seen
            as grounded in anomalous perceptions, involving experiences or
            events that provide a breakthrough from our everyday view of reality
            to another more insightful&nbsp;level.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keith Hill proposes that anomalous experiences lie at the heart of
            the new mysticism. In this illuminating study, he examines the
            historical and cultural developments that have contributed to a
            radical shift in mystical practice. He also weighs what is required
            for the fostering of what Einstein called “mystical wonderment” to
            be sustained.
          </p>

            boundaries between mysticism, history, science, religion and
            psychology. He is a three-time winner of the Ahston Wylie Award, New

          “Every culture has stories of saints meeting angels and devils,” the
          author writes in his latest nonfiction work, “sages rising into
          heaven, shamans transforming into animals, and mystics entering
          transcendental trance states in which their awareness expands beyond
          the usual body-centered limits.” What lies beyond those limits is the
          main subject of Hill’s (The Kosmic Web , 2015, etc.) volume, in which
          he attempts to present a more balanced view of both the materialist,
          verifiable reality all around his readers and the immaterial,
          subjective experiences they feel every day—what he refers to as “the
          sound of two hands clapping.” The book explores typical New Age
          phenomena like remote viewing and out-of-body experiences—both the
          author’s own and those of others—regularly reminding readers that
          “openness to enchantment drives the mystical outlook.” He focuses on
          personal perceptions during heightened states of awareness. Hill also
          takes readers on a cogent and inviting tour of mysticism throughout
          the last 3,000 years and its intricate connections with the births of
          both philosophy and science—including the long pursuit of alchemy,
          which preoccupied a number of great scientists, such as Isaac Newton.
          The author’s goal in all of this is to encourage his readers to
          “acknowledge subjectivity equally with objectivity,” insisting that
          “only when the spooky is normalised as just another way to experience
          reality, will we be able to accept that our existence encompasses two
          hands clapping.” ...&nbsp;An upbeat but uneven treatise that tries to
          create a level playing field for science and spirituality. - Kirkus
