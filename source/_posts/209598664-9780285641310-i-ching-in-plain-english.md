            The I Ching focuses on the belief that change is always possible,
            the only mistake in life is to be inflexible and not open to the
            opportunity of growth. It can be consulted about any situation where
            you desire to change an aspect of your life or your relationship
            with another. The I Ching seeks to make the most of any situation
            and to overcome the disharmony in a life.<br />In
            <b>I Ching In Plain English</b> George Hulskramer has balanced
            several new translations of recently published versions of the I
            Ching to capture the essential spirit of this ancient classic.<br />It
            opens up the meanings of the coins to a wider range of contemporary
            experience than is provided by Richard Wilhelm's traditionally
            accepted translation of 1923. The traditional Confucian version of
            the I Ching, which dominates Richard Wilhelm's edition, emphasises
            correct behaviour and good manners while the Taoist and Buddhist
            schools stress inner development, how to make changes to the
            relationships you have with people around you and how to manage
            change in your life.<br />George Hulskramer's synthesis of the
            differing versions of the I Ching makes this edition relevant for
            everyone interested in this ancient oracle. The multiple meanings of
            each hexagram are condensed into two pages that combine Buddhist and
            Taoist interpretations and translations with the Confucian
            translations used by Wilhelm.<br /><br />Based on several new
            translations of the I Ching, this groundbreaking interpretation
            explores the meaning of the ancient text and places it within the
            context of contemporary experience. Once used for consultation and
            guidance, this spiritual classic has come to emphasize inner
            development, relationship connections, the management of daily life
            changes, and the balance and harmony available in philosophies and
            actions. This edition's condensed commentary on coins and hexagrams
            allows for quick and easy consultation.<br /><br />

            in the 1920's, stress inner development, how to make changes to the

            change in your life. George Hulskramer's synthesis of the differing
            versions of the I Ching makes this edition relevant for everyone
            interested in this ancient oracle. For centuries people have
            consulted the I Ching, allowing themselves to be guided by it in
            their choices and this new translation balances the different
            versions of the I Ching to make this ancient oracle work for anyone.
            George Hulskramer has also condensed the commentary on each hexagram
            into two pages to allow quick and easy consultation for today's
            hectic world.
