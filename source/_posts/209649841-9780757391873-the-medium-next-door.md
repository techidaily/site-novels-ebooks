          <i>The Medium Next Door </i>is the amazing life story of spirit medium
          Maureen Hancock, who discovered her psychic abilities to see, hear,
          and speak with the dead when she was just five years old. Descended
          from a long line of legendary Irish mystics, Maureen was no stranger
          to the spiritual realm, but she still&nbsp;kept the messages from the
          departed to herself all throughout her childhood and teen years,
          eventually suppressing them almost completely.<br /><br />Maureen
          wouldn't open herself up to communicating with spirits again until she
          was in a near-fatal car crash. Soon after, she had hundreds of voices
          in her head, many of them helping her crack cases and expose fraud in
          her role as a litigation paralegal at a large Boston law firm.
          Accepting her gift but still keeping it to herself, she married and
          had two children.<br /><br />It wasn't until tragedy struck on 9/11
          and Maureen was bombarded with messages from the spirits that she
          realized she had to stop hiding her ability and put it to good use.
          She left her job at the law firm and opened the holistic healing
          center Pathways to Healing and launched the cancer foundation Manifest
          a Miracle. Today, she goes by the title Medium Mom and strives to
          balance raising children, raising the dead, assisting the dying,
          searching for missing children, and teaching about life after death.

          Sunday, October 16, 2011The Medium Next Door - A Review&nbsp;"I see
          dead people..." This famous line from the very popular movie, The
          Sixth Sense, has been quoted over and over, but for Maureen Hancock
          communing with the dead isn't a joke, it's a way of life.&nbsp; In The
          Medium Next Door, Maureen shares her life story which includes some of
          her own tragedies as well as her ability to hear and respond to the
          dead.&nbsp; This unique talent of Maureen's has helped many grieving
          people obtain peace, she has solved mysteries, assisted the dying and
          has landed her her very own television show.&nbsp; What makes Maureen
          different from all the other "ghostbusters"?&nbsp; "I enjoy making
          people smile," Maureen says.&nbsp; "I think what differentiates me
          from other spirit mediums is that I believe our loved ones in spirit
          enjoy coming through with a celebration and not reliving another
          wake."&nbsp; In addition Maureen likes to "jump in with humour and
          help the person left behind know that it's okay to continue living,
          laughing and celebrating these great memories." Even if you're
          skeptical about "ghosts" and an afterlife, Maureen's candor and
          readings are chillingly accurate - I found myself wishing she had a
          message from beyond for me!&nbsp; She also looks like an ordinary mom
          (no layers of flowing scarves and dangling jewelry).&nbsp; Her humor
          throughout the book is a wonderful change for a subject that could
          otherwise be morose.&nbsp; I will admit I had my doubts about
          Maureen's authenticity when I first picked up her book, however, the
          more I read the more I believed she truly does have a wonderful gift
          and the fact that she uses it for good (lots of time for free) is just
          more convincing. For more information on The Medium Next Door, please
