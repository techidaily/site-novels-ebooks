            Writing Phantoms in the Night or ETs? was not easy for author
            Lorraine McAdam, and what she relates in this book might not be
            believed by the vast majority of people - which is why she delayed
            writing it for so long… Indeed, until now, only those in her close,
            nuclear family had known of the details of her story, which has been
            a lifelong one. But in her heart she eventually realised that
            withholding her story - of what she has now come to believe is some
            form of ongoing ET contact - was no longer an option. And because it
            seems that the world at large has moved to a more enlightened
            attitude towards ‘abductees' or ‘experiencers' who have experienced
            and gone through this high strangeness, loosely called ‘alien
            contact', McAdam now thinks that the time is ripe to reveal her
            story. “This is my own simple, truthful, riveting, intriguing, and
            sometimes frightening account of multiple encounters, and
            experiences, with beings I believe originate from other worlds and,
            possibly, other dimensions”, she writes. “And yet I am, to all who
            know me, an ordinary English teacher, wife, and mother. So why me? I
            have no answer.”

          Lorraine McAdam is an artist, writer and poet. In the past, she worked
          as a nurse for twelve years. At 45, she trained to become a teacher,
          and she now runs her own tuition business. She is also unusual in that
          she believes she has been having encounters with the paranormal, ETs
          and UFOs since she was a child. She lives in Cumbria, UK.
