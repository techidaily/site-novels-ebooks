            >“When I finished <i>Witness to Roswell</i>, I said to myself, ‘Case
            closed!’ for the very wealth and sheer weight of eyewitness
            testimony.”—George Noory, host, <i>Coast to Coast AM</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          This classic in the field of UFOology is filled with hard-hitting
          eyewitness testimony of one of the most important events of all time:
          the actual recovery of a UFO outside of Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.
          For more than 70 years, government authorities have led us to believe
          the wreckage was merely a very conventional weather balloon—but the
          witnesses who were there continue to tell a different story.<br /><br /><b
            ><i>Witness to Roswell</i></b
          >
          once again provides a "can't put down" written account of what really
          transpired in Roswell decades ago. It pries loose the truth the
          government doesn't want us to know including the revelations of Walter
          Haut. This edition includes: A growing litany of deathbed confessions
          describing the "little people" recovered at the crash site.The most
          comprehensive time line of events ever published on this seminal
          event.The identity of the Boeing engineer called in to examine the
          exotic wreckage from the crash.What really took place at the Roswell
          base hospital and what nurse actually ordered the children’s
          caskets.The story of the soldier who wore gloves at the dinner table
          after guarding the "bodies." Clearly, the implications of this
          information are foreboding. One need only look at the fact that
          officials now have four explanations for this historic event—but to
          which one do all the witnesses testify on their deathbeds?<br /><br /><b
            ><i>Witness to Roswell</i></b
          >
          once again demonstrates to the world that no statute of limitation
          applies to the truth: We are not alone.<br /><br />
          This anniversary edition includes a new introduction by the authors
          and additional material.

          “The Roswell Incident remains important for UFO research, and the case
          remains alive today because of the determined efforts of the team of
          Carey and Schmitt. <i>Witness to Roswell</i> contains much information
          from new and credible witnesses who add more weight to the existing
          testimony and evidence that something extraordinary crashed in 1947.
          Their solid and determined work is to be applauded and is essential
          reading for anyone interested in the events of July 1947 at Roswell.”
