                >This guide to Integrative Medicine, based on quantum science,
                combines studies in consciousness, with alternative systems of
                healing such as Ayurveda and Yoga to produce a new science of
                health which sees disease as a health disorder. Required reading
                for health professionals and anyone looking for a deeper
                understanding of wellness.</span

              >Inspired by the Dalai Lama to apply the integrative ideas of
              quantum science to practical everyday problems in people’s lives,
              famed physicist Amit Goswami began working in 1999 in the field of
              health and healing. His first task was to use the new quantum
              metaphysics to provide a basic science for the systems of
              alternative medicine and thus begin a tentative integrative
              medicine. This was accomplished in </span
            ><i>The Quantum Doctor</i><span>, first published in 2004.</span
            ><span>&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
            <span
              >What was still lacking was a unified theory of health leading to
              a new science of heath which would treat disease as a health
              disorder. Much more expertise in specifics was needed for such a
              project. In 2016, Goswami partnered with Valentina Onisor, MD,
              trained in both allopathic and most systems of alternative
              medicine as well including Ayurveda, yoga, naturopathy,
              aromatherapy, and homeopathy. This book is the culmination of
              their efforts to date. It is intended for both laypeople and
              health professionals.</span

          Vishwalayam, acting as department of Quantum Science at the University
          of Technology in Jaipur, India, and developed a Master and PhD program
          in Quantum Science of Health, Prosperity and Happiness, an
          international program of transformative education.
