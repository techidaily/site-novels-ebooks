            >A pithy guide to the Buddha's instructions to unlock the powerful
            insights that make us "great"—by wise, warm, and humorous Brother
            Phap Hai, the most senior Australian Dharma teacher ordained by
            Thich Nhat Hanh&nbsp;&nbsp;</b
          ><br /><br />In this essential sutra for sincere practitioners, the
          Buddha says, "If you would like to be enlightened, take on these eight
          subjects for meditation and apply their corresponding insights to your
          daily life." Brother Phap Hai's lively, down-to-earth explanation of
          spirituality's original self-help manual makes this book a must-read
          for all seeking inspiration on the path of self-realization and
          compassion. Beginning with a brief historical overview of the sutra's
          origins, Brother Phap Hai explores each of the eight realizations and
          shares a story in each chapter from his own journey to become a monk
          himself.<br /><br />Ordaining as a Buddhist monk in 1997 while still
          in his twenties, Brother Phap Hai has been practicing mindfulness on a
          daily basis for much of his adult life. Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh
          authorized him to teach in 2003, and since then, he has guided and
          mentored thousands of students in meditation. Brother Phap Hai calls
          the Buddha's Discourse on the Eight Realizations of Great Beings his
          "'Desert Island Sutra' because it distills the essence of the Buddhist
          path." In his words, it is everything you need in a practical
          meditation manual, "a very structured exposition of realizing the
          entirety of the Buddhist path for yourself."<br />&nbsp;

          "We are fortunate to have Brother Phap Hai as a guide … a good
          spiritual friend.… He embodies the characteristics of a Dharma
          teacher." —from the foreword by <b>Rebecca Li, PhD</b>, dharma teacher
          in the lineage of Chan Master Sheng Yen<br /><br />"The Eight
          Realizations of Great Beings is the user manual for understanding how
          to navigate our lives in the continual churn of the pressure-packed,
          noisy, and often cruel modern world. Brother Phap Hai has made
          accessible&nbsp; the ancient wisdom of Buddhism, shedding a bright
          light on the truth of our existence that we so easily overlook.
          Explored gradually and patiently in small measures, this book helps
          our mind move towards the enlightenment that is inherent in all
          things."<br />—<b>Les Kaye</b>, abbot, Kannon Do Zen Center in
          Mountain View, California, and author of <i>Zen at Work</i> and
          <i>A Sense of Something Greater</i><br /><br />“Brother Phap Hai
          invites the reader along on his own journey through the
          <i>Eight Realizations of Great Beings</i>—from his initial resistance
          to the sutra’s seeming simplicity to his discovery of its profound
          beauty. It is an invitation to keep exploring for a lifetime, to
          ground ourselves in ordinary truths, to allow ourselves to wake up to
          something new.”&nbsp;—<b>Tracy Franz</b>, <i>Lion's Roar</i> magazine
          and&nbsp;author of

            >My Year of Dirt and Water: The Journal of a Zen Monk’s Wife in
            Japan</i
          ><br /><br />"Brother Phap's authorship and stories make this sutra's
          relevance alive for this moment in history. His heart at the center of
          the work shines with the brilliance of practice and study well lived
          and well shared. A must-read for practitioners and scholars alike."—<b
            >Larry Ward, PhD</b
          >, author of <i>America's Racial Karma</i><br /><br />"Thich Nhat Hanh
          loved the Eight Realizations of Great Beings. Brother Phap Hai has
          been living these teachings and his deep practice is evident in his
          reflections and insights. I appreciate his use of story and of humor;
          this to me is a sign of a great teacher."—<b>Peggy Rowe Ward</b>,
          author of <i>Love's Garden<br /><br /></i>"A student of Thich Nhat
          Hanh,&nbsp;Brother Phap Hai exudes an utterly contagious sense of
          calm, one that knows no boundaries of time or space.… I have long
          wondered how this 'miracle of calm' comes about, and am deeply
          grateful that he has written this book. Brother Phap Hai illuminates a
          road toward calm that each of us can travel—so, so necessary now, on
          this storm-tossed boat of ours."—<b>Joel ben Izzy</b>. storyteller and
          author of <i>The Beggar King and the Secret of Happiness<br /></i
          ><br />"Brother Phap Hai's down-to-earth approach and kindly humor
          make him the ideal guide to the profound teachings of the Sutra on the
          Eight Realizations of Great Beings and to help us find answers to the
          question, 'How do I apply the Dharma in my daily
          life?'”—<b>Bodhipaksa</b>, author of
          <i>This Difficult Thing of Being Human<br /></i><br />"Like his
          teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, not only concerned with how we live, but
          willing to meet us where we live.... Grounded in Buddhist practice and
          philosophy, the exercises and encouragement here are not highfalutin,'
          but practical and doable." —<b>Rod Meade Sperry</b>, editor of
