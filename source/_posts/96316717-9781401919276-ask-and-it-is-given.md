          <b><i>Ask and It Is Given</i></b
          >, the pivotal <b>manifestation and law of attraction book</b> by
          Esther and Jerry Hicks, presents the inspirational teachings of the
          nonphysical entity Abraham, to help you learn how to manifest your
          desires so that you’re living the joyous and fulfilling life you
          deserve. <br /><br />
          This empowering book will show you how to feel good now and as you
          read, you’ll come to understand how your relationships, health issues,
          finances, career concerns, and more are influenced by the Universal
          laws that govern your time/space reality—and you’ll discover powerful
          manifesting processes that will help you go with the positive flow of
          life. <br /><br />
          "An absolute must for anyone interested in the law of attraction, and
          using it to better their lives, finances and relationships." -
          <i>Soul &amp; Spirit</i> magazine<br /><br />
          <i
            >"The reason you have not already gotten what you desire is because
            you are holding yourself in a vibrational holding pattern that does
            not match the vibration of your desire."</i

          - Abraham<br /><br />
          <i>“Ask and It Is Given</i> is primarily about how whatever we’re
          asking for is being given to us—and it’s also the first book to ever,
          in such clear terminology, give us the simple practical formula for
          how to ask for, and then how to receive, whatever we want to be, do,
          or have. <br /><br />This book offers you a hands-on course in
          spiritual practicality and also teaches you how not to be, do, or have
          anything that displeases you.” - Jerry Hicks<br /><br />
          “One of the most valuable things about <i>Ask and It Is Given</i> is
          that Abraham gives us 22 different powerful processes to achieve our
          goals. No matter where we are, there’s a process that can make our
          lives better. I love this book, and I love Esther and Jerry Hicks!” —
          Louise Hay<br /><br />
