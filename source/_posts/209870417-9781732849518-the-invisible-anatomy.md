            JK Dickinson, the Intuitive, has been providing valuable intuitive
            insight in the areas of medicine, science, hospitality, sports,
            technology, and the entertainment industry for over two decades. An
            expert in analyzing where and why life moments have affected the
            physical, emotional and mental energy of the human body and spirit,
            the long-awaited book The Invisible Anatomy is now available. With
            case studies, precise data into the power of the vagus nerve,
            neurons, and how it affects the energy of the human spirit,&nbsp;you
            will quickly realize how much control you have over the wellbeing of
            your physical, mental, and emotional components&nbsp;of
            your&nbsp;life. Discovering how all the energy bodies work together
            or against each other is imperative if your goal is to take your
            wellness into your hands. J.K Dickinson writes with a simple
            communication style for all readers.

          Medicine is forever evolving. What was protocol years ago, is not
          necessarily valid today. I’ve learned this over the past three
          decades. Understanding how energy affects the human body is essential
          to understanding health. My patients continue to have success in
          overcoming deeply embedded emotional challenges with the knowledge
          learned from the Energy Center System and the Invisible Anatomy.
          Learning to listen to the signs and signals of your intuition, allows
          you to take ownership of your health and wellness.<br />— Dr. Gruska,
          NMD – Associate Professor Bastyr University Academic &amp; Clinical
          Education

          I believe the most intellectual language on the planet is that of
          intuition. When coupled with pure talent and emotional intelligence,
          there is no greater contribution to the embodiment of success in our
          lives. Having met Jennifer through a colleague at Microsoft, she
          taught me how to leverage my innate intuitive capabilities which has
          led to me reclaiming my confidence and manifesting my purpose in all
          aspects of my personal and professional life.<br />— Tina Eskridge, –
          Sr. Director Microsoft Corporation

          The energy body connects the mind and the physical body. Without the
          energy body, the mind cannot direct the physical body to action.
          Without the energy body, the physical body is just a lifeless body,
          like an inanimate object.<br />Unlike other books filled with mystical
          Eastern terms, this book gives down-to-earth descriptions of the
          energy centers, vagus nerve and the critical role the neurons play in
          the health of the human body. Instead of preaching theories, this book
          describes practical examples with actual cases. The reader can see
          that when faced with life events, the mind reacts to give rise to
          imbalances in the energy centers leading to physical illnesses. These
          cases confirm what I have encountered through clinical experience with
          patients.<br />In addition to the information about the energy centers
          that Jennifer has explained in her previous books, there is now
          information on the Invisible anatomy and the Vagus nerve. I invite you
          to read this book. You may recognize some imbalanced energy patterns
          described in this book in your own life.<br />—Dr. Huy Hoang, MD –
          Natural Health Medical Center, Los Angeles
