          research consultant. His&nbsp;systematic approach to categorizing,
          adapting and teaching meditation – known as Unified&nbsp;Mindfulness –
          has resulted in collaborations with Harvard Medical School,

          University of Arizona in the bourgeoning field of
          contemplative&nbsp;neuroscience. In 2019, Shinzen became the
          Co-Director of the Sonication Enhanced Mindful&nbsp;Awareness (SEMA)
          Lab at the University of Arizona Center for Consciousness Studies. The
          SEMA&nbsp;Lab endeavors to biophysically operationalize the
          measurement of mindful awareness.&nbsp;
