          A practical guide to simple daily techniques for rapid spiritual
          progress <br /><br />• Explores 11 time-tested methods for spiritual
          advancement and how you only need to include 7 each day for spiritual
          growth and personal enlightenment <br /><br />• Includes wisdom from
          spiritual masters from nearly every religion, including Christianity,
          Buddhism, Hinduism, and more <br /><br />• Offers routines, tips, and
          tricks to keep you on track, mantras for success and sacred
          connection, and exercises to apply these spiritual lessons in your
          everyday life <br /><br />Enlightenment means becoming a light unto
          yourself. But how does one get on the path to enlightenment? In this
          practical spiritual guide, Simon Chokoisky shares 11 time-tested yet
          simple daily techniques to help you find your spiritual path, or
          “dharma,” no matter what your spiritual background--be it Christian,
          Hindu, Buddhist, or Agnostic. He explains how everyone has a unique
          learning style as well as a spiritual style--your “Dharma type”--and
          how the Dharma method allows you to pick any seven of the 11 methods
          described in the book to practice. You can even change them daily, all
          based on your unique needs. And by holding to the 7/11 “rule” daily,
          you’ll soon find yourself on the road to rapid spiritual progress and
          personal enlightenment. <br /><br />In this book, the author explains
          how he distilled these 11 spiritual techniques from centuries of
          methods used by spiritual masters from around the world. He details
          the 5 different Dharma types and provides personality tests to
          determine your type. He provides routines, tips, and tricks to keep
          you on track as well as thoughtful exercises to help you apply
          spiritual principles in your everyday life. He explores how to apply
          the commandments of the Judeo-Christian tradition, the Yoga Yamas and
          Niyamas, and the Buddhist 8-fold path based on your Dharma type. He
          discusses the power of sound and how to use mantras for success and
          sacred connection. He also explains the best ways to purify your body
          and mind as well as how to create a “standing wave” of spiritual power
          to recharge yourself anytime during the day. <br /><br />Showing how
          spirituality is inherent in each of us and is abundant, free, and easy
          to cultivate, the author reveals how you can best cultivate your
          spiritual light and share it with the world.

          "Author Simon Chokoisky says in his preface that the working title for
          <i>The Dharma Method</i> was 'The Lazy Person's Guide to
          Enlightenment.' So what, exactly, is this book offering help with?
          Basically, mindfulness. This is the mindfulness guide for people who
          don't want to hear about angels, chakras, or vibration levels. There
          is, as you might imagine, a chapter devoted to each of the 11
          suggested practices to guide novitiates in their use, but they are all
          more practical than philosophical. I consider this a recommended read
          if you are a practical minded reader who finds many similar books too
          fluffy to make it through."
