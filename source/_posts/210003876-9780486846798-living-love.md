          "<i>Living Love</i>&nbsp;helps aspiring practitioners discover simple
          ways to create daily heart-centered practices that can help anyone
          experience the real, the good, the true, and the beautiful — which is,
          of course, what we were created for. This book reminds us that we were
          all made by Love to love.” — Father Richard Rohr, author of&nbsp;the
          <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller <i>The Universal Christ</i
          ><br /><br />
          With
          <i
            >Living Love:&nbsp;12 Heart-Centered Practices to Transform Your
            Life</i
          >, Victoria Price, the author of
          <i>Vincent Prince: A Daughter’s Biography</i> and
          <i>The Way of Being Lost: A Road Trip to My Truest Self</i>, shows how
          you can be the person you long to be — someone who overflows with
          immense joy, experiences deep connection,&nbsp;expresses their
          creativity, and feels profound peace.<br />
          &nbsp;A spiritual self-help book, <i>Living Love</i> demonstrates how
          to turn aside the fears that stand between you and self-fulfillment
          and to embrace the healing power of love, permitting it to transform
          every aspect of your life. From creating a daily routine of joy and
          gratitude to developing a practice of presence and forgiveness,
          Victoria provides the tools for taking delight in being alive,
          countering fear, and developing compassion and openness.<br /><br />
          "<i>Living Love</i>&nbsp;is as elementary and accessible a Life Guide
          as it is a profound examination of the inner psyche. Victoria Price
          has dedicated her sharp and probing mind to the deepest corridors of
          her emotions, and then expanded out to reach every one of us, hungry
          to live our days in the most meaningful, joyous ways possible. You
          will do more than read this book. You will work it into your inner
          soul, page by page." — Diana Nyad, author of&nbsp;<i>Find a Way</i
          ><br /><br />
          "Victoria Price throws a marvelous light on the notion of what it is
          to PRACTICE. It's not about running scales on the piano or hitting
          endless tennis balls. This is a gentle, deeply insightful guide to the
          practice of the art of Joy. I use this book whenever my mind goes dark
          and I need a good old reset of the spirit." — Jane Anderson,
          Emmy-award winning screenwriter<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          "Victoria Price is a master of spiritual inspiration. In&nbsp;<i
            >Living Love</i
          >, she takes a big idea (what it's like to live from a place of love)
          and breaks it down into a dozen steps, showing the reader how to
          accomplish each one with the help of simple but effective exercises
          that have helped her in her own journey. Victoria acts as a guide, a
          cheerleader, a trusted friend, and a professional coach with a wicked
          sense of humor who is patient enough to walk every bit of the journey
          with you. Part of the brilliance of this book is that Victoria won't
          push you to change the way many self-help books try to do. Instead,
          she'll teach you to heal — and then&nbsp;spiritual growth is
          inevitable. Be forewarned: You'll put this book down a different
          person than you were when you picked it up." — Katy&nbsp;Koontz,
          editor-in-chief,&nbsp;<i>Unity Magazine</i><br /><br />
          “For anyone who is letting fear stop them, this book will teach you
          how to take the driver’s seat of your mind. You will finish the last
          page a changed person, understanding that <i>Living Love</i> is not
          optional but the only truth there is.” — Carly Pollack, author
          of&nbsp;<i>Feed Your Soul</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Victoria Price has written an open-hearted, very personal guide for
          taking the journey back ‘home’ to our True Self, and widening the
          universal circle of Love. Using her own experiences and incorporating
          numerous wisdom traditions, we are taken on a journey into the daily
          discipline of practicing Love — and come out the other end of this
          trip inward with a greater sense of joy and compassion.” — Jane S.
          Galloway, author of <i>The Gateways</i>
