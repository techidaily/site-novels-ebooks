          <br />Through extraordinary meditations, affirmations, holistic
          healing plant-based medicine, KMT temple teachings, and The Rites of
          Passage guidance, Queen&nbsp;Afua&nbsp;teaches us how to love and
          rejoice in our bodies by spiritualizing the words we speak, the foods
          we eat, the relationships we attract, the spaces we live and work in,
          and the transcendent woman spirit we manifest. With love, wisdom, and
          passion,&nbsp;Queen&nbsp;Afua&nbsp;guides us to accept our mission and
          our mantle as Sacred Women—to heal ourselves, the generations of women
          in our families, our communities, and our world.

          “I was divinely introduced to Queen Afua in January of 2019. I was
          clouded and confused as to what was my real power in the feminine.
          With following her program I learned what real food does to my body
          temple, how I can heal myself and create a peaceful life after Grief
          and Loss. Queen has assisted me in healing and connecting deeper into
          my soul. I will forever be grateful for one of my master teachers, my
          spiritual Mother. She is a gift from the most high.”<b
