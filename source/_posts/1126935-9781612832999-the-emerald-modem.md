            Twenty years ago, in England, author Richard Leviton "discovered the
            planet." Following quite specific guidance, he began a long process
            that amounted to an apprenticeship. "My mentors dispatched me to
            various specific locations in the Somerset landscape, and at all
            hours of the night and day. I sat on hills and valleys and rocks
            under sunlight, moonlight, rain, snow, and fog, and had visions. I
            started to see another landscape behind the apparent landscape. It
            was an apparitional landscape with stars, planets, galaxies, angels,
            spirits of Nature, mythic deities, divinity." As time went on, he
            found himself talking with angels, visiting celestial cities, and
            following gnomes. He came to understand that at one level we are the
            planet, and that both we and it have an intimate relationship with
            our galaxy.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I found myself living inside the myths of the world as if they were
            expert scripts for real-life inner adventures. I never once thought
            I was crazy. Why should I? Quite the opposite. I believed I was
            finally getting grounded in something real. But it would take me
            twenty years to make sense of it. That sense is embodied in
            <i>The Emerald Modem</i>."
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>The Emerald Modem</i> includes:<br />direct correspondences
            between human chakras and the Earth's energy features--and the
            galactic originalstables listing locations of sacred sites around
            the planet where you may experience this relationshipexplanations of
            world myths, which provide clues to this unsuspected visionary world
            around us
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the first book to synthesize all the fragments of geomantic
            perception (sacred sites, energy points, vertexes, etc.) into a
            global interactive model that ties human consciousness directly to
            it. Leviton describes 85 subtle features in the planetary landscape,
            places you can go for mystical experiences. They are features of the
            Earth's energy body, almost all invisible to conventional sight. But
            psychic cognition can be trained, and you can usefully interact with
            any of these types of sites today without seeing what you're doing.
            Your intent to interact for the benefit of yourself and the planet
            is all that's required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as modems dial us into the Internet, so the features of the
            Earth's energy body described in <i>The Emerald Modem</i> help us
            get online with the galaxy. You can learn to visit Grail Castles,
            experience a Mount Olympus, or walk through the stars in a landscape
            zodiac--and you can learn enough to become confident that you're not
            traveling alone.
