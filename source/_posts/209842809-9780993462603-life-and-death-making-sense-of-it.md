          <p>
            This will be the biggest event of your life, and no doubt you have
            been preparing for it...
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What's that, you haven't yet looked into it?</strong> Okay,
            so might this be a good moment to make a start? Would you
            willy-nilly sign up to climb Everest without preparation and knowing
            what you are letting yourself in for? Probably not, and yet this
            event is going to be much bigger than any attempts at Everest.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Make a start: Read this book</strong>. Written by a reformed
            sceptic; Life and Death, Making Sense of It, offers an alternative
            thought-provoking perspective on our spiritual situation – to that
            offered by more conventional understanding. It explores life, and
            the nature of soul, through a range of topics including the
            paranormal, near-death experience, past lives, human evolution,
            karma, reincarnation, and the Other Side. It raises demanding
            questions and offers answers to why we are here, and where we are
            heading.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This book will help you to begin redressing the balance, to make
            sense of your own life and death. It will help you to decide how
            best to prepare for the big event. All you need do is join the
            author inside, and you are on your way.
          </p>

          This book has the potential to change the world view of its readers.
          It offers a broad yet very detailed sweep across the whole spectrum of
          the subject matter, which makes the book wide-ranging and inclusive.I
          am pretty cynical when it comes to believing in the supernatural in
          any form, but I found myself having to stop short and really think
          about the possibility of life after death here. I particularly liked
          how it touches on the fact that people who believe in life after death
          are happier than those who don't. Food for thought, indeed.This is a
          very individual and readable book which is written from the heart, and
          which reaches out with great warmth to its readers. Joanne Harrington,
