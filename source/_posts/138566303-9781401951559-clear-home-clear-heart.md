            >Have you ever entered a room and it just didn’t feel right, yet you
            couldn’t explain why?&nbsp;<br />Do you sense a natural comfort with
            some people but are immediately stressed by others?&nbsp;</b
          ><br /><br />The truth is that we’re all influenced far more than we
          realize by the invisible energy of the people and places around us.
          This, along with difficult experiences in your past that still weigh
          you down, can keep you from being a creative force in your life.<br /><br />Clearing
          is a gentle but powerful way to release the old stress you’re still
          carrying from your life history, as well as transform how you’re
          affected by the energy around you each day. Many people experience
          immediate shifts in their energy during a clearing, and significant
          change often unfolds in the days and weeks afterward. In fact,
          clearing has even been described as "accelerated meditation" because
          it can lead to a sense of calm and happiness that typically results
          only after years of a mindfulness practice.<br /><br />In this simple,
          elegant guide, Jean Haner teaches you, in easy-to-follow steps, how to
          clear your own energy or that of any person, as well as bring harmony
          to the energy of the spaces you inhabit, so you can reclaim your
          vitality and joy, and open up infinite new possibilities in
          life.&nbsp;<br /><br />Healers, intuitives, energy workers, highly
          sensitive people, and anyone who just wants to optimize their energy
          and live their best life will find this to be the perfect training.
          Jean refines energy clearing to its pure essence—the power of the
          compassionate heart!

          "In <i>Clear Home, Clear Heart</i>, Jean Haner has done an excellent
          job of addressing the powerful effect that energy has on our lives.
          Her new book offers a thorough understanding of how to identify and
          release the negative energy that causes distress in our environment,
          in our relationships, and to our emotional and physical health. As
          someone who lives life from an energetic perspective, I started using
          her strategies right away and feel deeply grateful for this practical
          handbook!"<br />—<b>Cheryl Richardson</b>,

          brilliant intuitive who had to learn in the laboratory of her own body
          what she teaches here in <i>Clear Home, Clear Heart</i>—and you will
          be the beneficiary. Many more people are challenged by the energies
          around them than is generally recognized. This book is a gem, helping
          you to not only become aware of these energies but also know what to
          do about them. And I am so relieved that I can recommend this book to
          body workers and healers who often ‘pick up’ energy from their
          clients."<br />—<b>Donna Eden</b>, author of&nbsp;<i

        </h4>
        <p>
          Jean Haner is a natural intuitive empath, able to physically feel and
          work with subtle energy. Highly sensitive as a child, she easily
          absorbed other people’s stress and was too affected by the energy held
          in environments. But through 30 years of training, research, and
          experience, Jean transformed her sensitivity from a challenge into the
          power to clear and bring balance to the energy of people and places.
          People all over the world have discovered in Jean's workshops a
          community of like minds, who support each other in their commitment to
          a more conscious path, one that is based on the power of the
          compassionate heart. Website: www.jeanhaner.com
