              >A riveting look at the tremendous promise and inherent risks of
              the use of psychedelics in mental health treatment through the
              lens of a New York Times reporter whose journalistic exploration
              of this emerging field began with a personal crisis.</b
            ><br /><br />When he signed up for a psychedelic retreat run by a
            mysterious Argentine woman deep in Brazil’s rainforest in early
            2018, Ernesto Londoño, a veteran <i>New York Times </i>journalist,
            was so depressed he had come close to jumping off his terrace weeks
            earlier. His nine-day visit to Spirit Vine Ayahuasca Retreat Center
            included four nighttime ceremonies during which participants imbibed
            a vomit-inducing plant-based brew that contained DMT, a powerful
            mind-altering compound.<br /><br />The ayahuasca trips provided
            Londoño an instant reprieve from his depression and became the
            genesis of a personal transformation that anchors this sweeping
            journalistic exploration of the booming field of medicinal
            psychedelics. Londoño introduces readers to a dazzling array of
            psychedelic enthusiasts who are upending our understanding of trauma
            and healing. They include Indigenous elders who regard psychedelics
            as portals to the spirit world; religious leaders who use
            mind-bending substances as sacraments; war veterans suffering from
            PTSD who credit psychedelics with changing their lives; and
            clinicians trying to resurrect a promising field of medicine hastily
            abandoned in the 1970s as the United States declared a War on
            Drugs.<br /><br />Londoño’s riveting personal narrative pulls the
            reader through a deeply researched and brilliantly reported account
            of a game-changing industry on the rise. <i>Trippy</i> is the
            definitive book on psychedelics and mental health today, and
            Londoño’s in-depth and nuanced look at this shifting landscape will
            be pivotal in guiding policymakers and readers as they make sense of
            the perils, limitations, and promises of turning to psychedelics in
            the pursuit of healing.

          <b>Oprah's Book Club recommendation</b><br /><br />“A moving, tender
          and thoughtful exploration of a complicated subject. If you want to
          understand psychedelics better, this is a great place to start.”<br /><b
            >—Johann Hari, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
            <i>Stolen Focus </i>and <i>Lost Connections</i></b
          ><br /><br />"A compulsively readable romp through a burgeoning scene
          that has immense potential for both harm and healing."<br /><b

            <i>10% Happier </i>and host of the Ten Percent Happier podcast</b
          ><br /><br />"I loved the reported memoir <i>Trippy</i
          ><i>: The Peril and Promise of Medicinal Psychedelics </i>by the
          <i>New York Times</i> journalist Ernesto Londoño. A testament to the
          complexity of Londoño’s perspective is that some passages made me
          really want to try ayahuasca and some definitely didn’t. A thorough
          and fair-minded reporter, Londoño also writes movingly about his own
          extended family, experiences with depression, and delightfully
          unexpected courtship." <br /><b
            >—Curtis Sittenfeld, <i>The Guardian</i></b
          ><br /><br />"In Ernesto Londoño's courageous and revelatory book, a
          whole new continent sails into view: of the hidden corners of our
          minds, and of the mysterious substances that light them up. This
          journey inside the brain and around the world taught me more than any
          book I've read in a long time. It's an important book, one that will
          save people's lives."<br /><b
            >—Benjamin Moser, Pulitzer Prize winning author of
            <i>Sontag: Her Life and Work</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Trippy is a meticulously researched investigation into
          the brave new world of psychedelics. But it’s so much more than that.
          It’s the story of how — in learning about the passages other travelers
          found for relieving their pain — Ernesto Londoño found joy, love and
          illumination.”<br /><b

            co-author of <i>Mad Honey</i></b
          ><br /><br />"<i>New York Times</i> correspondent Londoño debuts with
          an arresting survey of the “medicinal psychedelic field” and where
          it’s headed...a scrupulous study of a fascinating development in
          mental health care.”<br /><b
            >—<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</b
          ><br /><br />“Blending solid research and personal experience, the
          author points to a new frontier for trauma treatment.”<br /><b
            >—Kirkus</b
          ><br /><br />“An engaging memoir…<i>Trippy</i> is a fascinating
          account of the world of medicinal psychedelics.”<br /><b>—LA Times</b
          ><br /><br />
          “<i>Trippy: The Perils and Promise of Medicinal Psychedelic</i>s is
          Ernesto Londoño’s mix of candid personal reflection and deep
          reporting, illuminating a growing trend in mental health that many of
          us don’t understand.”<br /><b
            >—<i>New York Times</i> Columnist Frank Bruni's Opinion
            Newsletter</b
          ><br /><br />"Londoño has drunk the brew, but, thankfully, not the
          Kool-Aid…Seeing the perils and the promise of psychedelic experience
          play out in Londono's own mind, as he comes to terms over years with
          his own (quite considerable) personal traumas, is a privilege.”
          <br /><b>—The Telegraph</b><br /><br />“This title about utilizing
          medicinal psychedelics in the treatment plans of some conditions could
          easily have future public policy implications worldwide. The subject
          matter will be of interest to many readers.”<br /><b
