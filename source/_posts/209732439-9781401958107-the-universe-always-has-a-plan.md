          “<i>The Universe Always Has a Plan</i>&nbsp;is unlike anything I’ve
          seen or read before. Matt Kahn has articulated the basics of a new and
          more compassionate spirituality that—at last—includes our emotions and
          our humanity as well as our divinity. His Golden Rules are game
          changers that have the power to shift the way you see yourself and
          your world—bringing love, compassion, healing, joy, and humor—where
          before, there was shame, blame, and criticism. I love this book.”<br />—&nbsp;<b

            >The Universe Always Has a Plan&nbsp;</i
          >is a beautiful book that really showcases Matt Kahn’s soul-sensitive
          work. He takes you on a journey that explores 10 powerful Golden Rules
          along with impactful mantras and simple exercises that will lead you
          on a journey of transformation, self-fulfillment, and emotional
          freedom—creating a life of joy and purpose. I highly recommend this
          book for anyone regardless of where they are on their spiritual
          journey.”<br />—&nbsp;<b>Anita Moorjani</b>,&nbsp;<i

          >“When you read truths like those contained in this book, they seem so
          clear, so obvious,and so liberating, that you can never unknow them
          again. In this way, Matt Kahn delivers us, once again, to the sanity
          of a love-based life, compassionately busting all of the reflexive
          myths that have kept us stuck in suffering.”<br />—&nbsp;<b
