              ><i>Soul Conversations</i> reveals how you can tap into your
              soul’s wisdom, connect with the universe, and communicate with
              loved ones and guides in the spirit world. Drawing on the author’s
              extensive training and experience, you’ll learn how to develop
              intuition, cultivate your “soul senses,” and create a personal
              spirituality that interweaves the invisible world with the

          <p>
            We are all connected—to each other and to an infinite intelligence
            that some call spirit, source, universe, or God. To come to the
            understanding that we are spiritual beings having a human
            experience, we must reacquaint ourselves with our very essence, or
            soul. This book invites you to embark on that magical journey and
            explore the eternity of the universe within each of us.
          </p>
