            >“A superb survey of the paranormal” and a travelogue through the
            twilight zone of human consciousness—hailed by experts as the best
            introduction to psychic phenomena (Herbie&nbsp;Brennan,
            <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author).</b
          ><br /><br />This is the most entertaining and broad survey of the
          paranormal ever made—combining forgotten lore, evidence
          from&nbsp;parapsychological&nbsp;experiments, and the testimonies of
          scientists, archaeologists, anthropologists, psychologists,
          physicists, and philosophers. Exploring the possibility that
          paranormal phenomena may be objectively real,&nbsp;this travelogue
          through the twilight zone of human consciousness is both
          scientifically rigorous and extremely entertaining.&nbsp;<br /><br />Readers
          may be surprised to learn that reputable scientists, among them
          several Nobel laureates, have claimed that:<br />&nbsp;<br />•&nbsp;telepathy
          is a reality<br />•&nbsp;Cleopatra’s lost palace and Richard III’s
          burial place were recovered with clairvoyance<br />• the US military
          set up&nbsp;an espionage program using psychics&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Could
          it be that what we usually call “supernatural” is a natural but little
          understood communication via this mental internet? &nbsp;The winner of
          the most prestigious award in the field,
          the&nbsp;Parapsychological&nbsp;Association Book Award,
          <i>A Short History of (Nearly) Everything Paranormal</i> is an
          engaging, entertaining and informative analysis of a controversial
          subject.
