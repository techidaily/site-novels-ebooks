          This book is life changing, Marisa Peer is an amazing inspiration. The
          book really gives a great insight into our own thoughts, feelings and
          how this affects our entire being. &nbsp;One of the best life
          transformational books I've ever read. Well worth it - Jenni Bell
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't put it down! I felt a change as I finished the book and
          feel equipped to implement these life changing techniques into my
          daily life to be the best version of me and live the best life I can.
          Ideal Christmas present (with a lipstick). Thank you! - Fiona M

          Another amazing book by an amazing person. These three words have
          changed me and the insights consolidate the work and learning I have
          acquired over the years of following Marisa. - J-dog

          ‘I want to give this I Am Enough message 1000+. Doing this training
          has changed my life and many of those around me. Thank you is not a
          big enough word to say. - Sum
        </p>
        <p>
          I have come to finally understand how I Am Enough shows up in my life,
          and when it doesn't. I've got the words on a sticky note on my monitor
          and I've become so much more confident in my own enoughness that I
          even speak differently. Thank you Marisa Peer for opening the door to
          greater understanding, healing and raising of the
          collective&nbsp;energies.&nbsp;-&nbsp;Warren

          I Am Enough&nbsp;changed the way I viewed myself. This three letter
          word snapped me out of the lowest period of my life. Since then it’s
          been my mantra. -&nbsp;Nazia
