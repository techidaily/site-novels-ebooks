            Rainbow Gum’s Gift is the channelled teachings of one of Earth’s
            great Sisters. The wise Eighty-year-old Rainbow Gum brings you
            freedom from all past pains and hurts, self-love and a unique way of
            guiding life’s journey.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            She’ll remind you of the importance of living through your heart,
            your connection of love to others, gifts and the importance of being
            present. She’ll guide you through the challenges of feeling stuck in
            the past, frustrated by habit, lonely and full of sadness. She will
            help open your heart and mind to untold possibilities and assist you
            to live your highest truth with compassion, stillness and joy beyond
            anything you ever dreamed.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Being supported with the magic of Rainbow Gum’s Gift is like resting
            your back on the vibrant trunk and listening to her whispers of
            great wisdom. Allow her words to caress you and fill you with
            love.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            This inspiring gift book is designed to unlock your own hearts
            wisdom. Rochelle invites you to discover the magic, love, feeling
            free of all past hurt and pain and joy that she experienced, sitting

          "I was so blown away reading how Rochelle was able to free herself
          from her painful past by connecting with the beautiful rainbow gum
          tree. The lessons she gleaned from this spiritual connection are
          applicable for anyone seeking joy - a beautiful
          story."&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Megan Castran - Jewelchic</strong>

          “Rainbow Gum’s Gift is a beautiful simple enjoyable read and yet so
          profound for all who are searching for answers to their life journey
          questions. As you quickly emerge into the story you find hidden wisdom
          and treasures that can help you find inner awareness to improve your
          life journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rochelle has brought awareness and understanding back to the centre
          point of what life is about, the ability to find heart centred love.
          She has captured the value of what nature can teach in the responses
          given by the Rainbow Gum to her probing questions. Thank you for an
          enjoyable experience.”&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong

          “Reading about Rochelle’s experience meeting Rainbow Gum was
          uplifting. I had tears whilst also feeling great joy. I felt I could
          reach out and hug Rainbow Gum. I had an experience of great joy and
          deep emotion when I hand delivered something for Rochelle, having lost
          my own mother one year ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          This book reminds every kind heart be open and full to all the love
          and joy that life has to offer. Thank you Rochelle for sharing with
          everyone the joy of the Rainbow Gum.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong

          “I felt extremely honoured to read the beautiful Rainbow Gum’s Gift. I
          instantly connected to the joy that I also felt at her base when I was
          in Maui Hawaii. This book is full of love and wisdom which I am
          grateful to be uplifted by. Thank you Rochelle for
          sharing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong
