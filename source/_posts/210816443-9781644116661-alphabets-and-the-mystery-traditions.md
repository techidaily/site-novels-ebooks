            >Reveals the esoteric mysteries encoded in the order of the
            alphabet</b
          ><br /><br />• Explores the secrets hidden in our alphabet and how
          each letter represented a specific stage on the alchemical path toward
          enlightenment<br /><br />• Divides our alphabet’s sequence of letters
          into three distinct parts: the first representing Earth and the
          natural year, the second the Underworld and the hero’s journey, and
          the third the Heavens and astronomical cycles<br /><br />• Reveals how
          the ancient secrets encoded in the numerical order of the alphabet can
          be found in Mystery Traditions and divination systems throughout the
          world<br /><br />Our alphabet hides a Mystery older than its magic of
          turning sound into shapes. Secrets lie in the choice of objects chosen
          to represent early alphabet letters and their order, a pattern
          inherited by numerous traditions, an alchemical spell to return the
          sun from the dark and guide the soul toward enlightenment.
          <br /><br />Revealing the spell hidden in our alphabet, Judith Dillon
          explores the importance of the placement of each letter in early
          alphabets and how each letter represented a specific step on the
          alchemical path of self-transformation. She investigates the
          alphabet’s spread around the world, beginning in Egypt and then
          spreading through Hebrew, Greek, and other ancient systems of writing
          and divination. These include Germanic Runes, Celtic Oghams, Tarot
          cards, the I Ching, and the wisdom of Mother Goose. Comparing the
          mythic attributes of many traditions, the author reveals the
          commonality of a numerical placement of symbols and how the hidden
          message was adapted by multiple peoples using objects and shapes from
          their own traditions. <br /><br />Examining the esoteric wisdom
          encoded in the alphabet, Dillon divides the numerical sequence of
          letters into three distinct parts. The first family of letters
          represents the Earth and describes the cycle of the natural year. The
          second family represents the Underworld and symbolizes the hero’s
          journey through judgments and death into the light of day. The third
          represents the Heavens and its astronomical cycles. Together, our
          alphabet symbols are a spell of alchemical stages on a path toward the
          light. Hidden in plain sight, our alphabet represents a transmission
          of ancient wisdom, the great alchemical Mystery of transforming dark
          earth into shining gold, of releasing the soul from the bonds of
          matter into the gold of enlightenment.

          “Timely and well written. Judith Dillon casts her eye over the great
          mystery of communication in a magical way that sends you on a quest
          through the very meaning of the alphabet. We give little thought to
          the letters we use every day, but they are tools for magic, for
          mystery, and for our communion with each other. Next time you use your
          keyboard, look down at the individual letters and ask yourself ‘Where
          did they come from?’ This book will give you the answer. Informative,
          lucid, and captivating.”
