            themselves and then use them to take inspired action on the way to
            following their life purpose.

          clear, bright voice stands out. George's message of hope and healing
          feels so true, not only because he communicates the timeless wisdom of
          the heavens, but also because he is grounded so deeply in his own
          truth down here on earth.” -&nbsp;<strong

          levels. Thank you, George for putting your work into the world so that

          “Lightworkers Gotta Work is a must read for anyone who has that
          niggling feeling that they are here to help this planet in a big way,
          but hasn't quite worked out how. This book is filled to overflowing
          with activities, tips and tricks to help the reader boost their
          intuitive connection, balance their masculine and feminine energies,
          work with energy, and move through just about anything that may come
          up on the spiritual pathway. If you know you have a light within you
          but need a hand turning it on, activating it and sharing it with the
          world, this book needs to be on your shelf, by your bed, or in your
          bag at all times!” -&nbsp;<strong

          “In Lightworkers Gotta Work, George Lizos leads the reader on a
          journey of lightwork, through his compelling personal stories that are
          in service to the work, and step‐by‐step levels of tools and mastery.
          In inclusive, direct, and progressive spiritual analysis, George lifts
          high‐minded spiritual seeking from dogma, anti-intellectualism, and
          outdated beliefs on sexuality and gender. If you do the work in
          Lightworkers Gotta Work, you’ll find yourself walking a path with
          George as a friend and the Universe as a guide. I highly recommend it
          for anyone looking for a way in, a mentor, and/or a refresher on the
          universal themes. Thank you, George, for putting in this work to help
          us all rise to your excellence!” -&nbsp;<strong
