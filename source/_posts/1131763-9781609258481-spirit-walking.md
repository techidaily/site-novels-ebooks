              >“Evelyn Rysdyk brilliantly taps into this powerful ancient
              tradition for guidance and healing. Learn from this master
              teacher. Read, reflect, devote yourself to these practices she and
              you too can become a spirit walker.”—Sandra Ingerman, author of
              <i>Shamanic Journeying: A Beginner's Guide</i></b
            ><br /><br />Shamanism is an ancient spirituality rooted in the
            belief that all matter has consciousness and that accessing the
            spirit in all things is part of what keeps the world and people
            healthy and in balance. Spirit beings surround us and are the source
            of a spirit walker's ability to profoundly influence life events and
            thrive in difficult circumstances.<br /><br />In<i>
              Spirit Walking</i
            >, shamanic practitioner Evelyn Rysdyk shows how we can all connect
            with the spirit world to find balance and healing. Using shamanic
            techniques that have been proven over thousands of years of human
            existence, Rysdyk offers a step-by-step guide to understanding and
            integrating shamanic practices into one's life through:

          <p>
            Rysdyk shares powerful stories of shamans from a variety of cultures
            such as Nepal, Tuva, the Ulchi from Siberia, and from Peru. She
            brings a fresh perspective to the work by showing how the latest
            findings in quantum physics are verifying that we are all connected
            in an intricate web of energy and spirit.
