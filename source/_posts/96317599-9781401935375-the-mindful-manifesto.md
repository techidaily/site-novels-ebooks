            >"<i>The Motivation Manifesto</i> is a poetic and powerful call to
            reclaim our lives and find our own personal freedom. It's a
            triumphant work that transcends the title, lifting the reader from
            mere motivation into a soaringly purposeful and meaningful life. I
            love this book." - Paulo Coelho<br /></b
          ><br /><i>The Motivation Manifesto</i> is a pulsing, articulate,
          ferocious call to claim our personal power. World-renowned high
          performance trainer Brendon Burchard reveals that the main motive of
          humankind is the pursuit of greater Personal Freedom. We desire the
          grand liberties of choice-time freedom, emotional freedom, social
          freedom, financial freedom, spiritual freedom. Only two enemies stand
          in our way: an external enemy, defined as the social oppression of who
          we are by the mediocre masses, and an internal enemy, a sort of
          self-oppression caused by our own doubt and fear.<br /><br />The march
          to Personal Freedom, Burchard argues, can be won only by declaring our
          intent and independence, stepping into our personal power, and
          battling through self-doubt and the distractions of the day until full
          victory is won. Recalling the revolutionist voices of the past that
          chose freedom over tyranny, Burchard-at times poetic yet always
          fierce-motivates us to free ourselves from fear and take back our
          lives once and for all.
