            >A breast cancer survivor shares her journey of faith and hope to
            inspire others who find themselves lost, afraid, and unsure of their
            path in life. </b
          ><br /><br />Everyone at one time or another is seeking a miracle,
          something to believe in, something concrete. Cathy Alves Davis found
          herself in just such a place. She was in her forties when she was
          diagnosed with Aggressive Stage III Breast Cancer. Given little hope
          of surviving, she knew whom to turn to in the tough times. Actually,
          Cathy had been doing it all her life. So, she turned to the only one
          that could help her, God.<br /><br />Without even knowing it at the
          time Cathy was about to step into her Divine Destiny. A destiny that
          would propel her into a world of giving hope and inspiration to
          countless others just as God planned. <i>Myrcles</i> is a story of
          faith, family, betrayal, love, adversity, hope, inspiration and
          Miracles. You won’t want to miss what the Gift of Faith did for
          Cathy’s life. And how adversity gave her a whole new beginning.<br /><br /><b
            >“A poignant, uplifting and inspiring story, courtesy of an
            incredible woman who will share her wisdom, her journey with God and
            her faith.” —<i>Red Headed Book Lover</i></b

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Cathy Alves Davis</b> lives with her husband in Montclair,
          Virginia. In 1998, she received a deadly diagnosis of Stage III
          Aggressive Breast Cancer. That’s when God spoke to her as He had done
          when she was a young child. God allowed her to know that she would
          survive and that one day she would go on to write a book of hope and
          inspiration that would help countless others. Years after her
          miraculous recovery at the famed Georgetown University Hospital in
          Washington, D.C., Cathy began the task of writing the book God told
          her to write. She named the book <i>Myrcles</i>. For more than two
          decades now, she has gone on to counsel women of all ages who are
          facing frightening odds themselves. She has appeared on QVC,
          Nightline, ABC, and NBC news. Cathy also wrote a feature story for
          Breast Cancer Wellness Magazine titled <i>Stay In The Day</i>.
