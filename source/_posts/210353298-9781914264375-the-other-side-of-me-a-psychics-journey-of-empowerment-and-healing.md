          <p>
            Sylvia was born in London in 1939, just before World War II started.
            She was told her life had been mapped out for the work she had to do
            by a higher power that changes her life forever. Throughout her
            life, she has always felt that angels guided her and that she had a
            connection with this higher power. After being reduced to living in
            a homeless shelter with two children at the age of twenty-three,
            Sylvia had the most <strong>extraordinary experience</strong>. She
            began feeling the presence of a wonderful divine being in her life
            as a permanent guide that has stood by her to this day. Her journey
            included meeting up with <strong>spirit </strong>on the other side
            and having an encounter with a <strong>UFO</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Other Side of Me</strong> has her full life story, which
            is one of disability, losing her speech at an early age during an
            air raid, and having to attend a special needs school. When she did
            regain her speech, she still found it difficult to pronounce certain
            words. This affected her education on all levels. But Sylvia refused
            to let anything hold her back in life and stayed positive. And
            that's what she wants her readers to know. She wants the world to
            know not only how she survived and made it, but also how the world
            can do it, too, if only they could open up to the
            <strong>reality</strong> beyond this reality.
