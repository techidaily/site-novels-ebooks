            and studied astrology for many years, and this is one of the most
            accessible and practical guides ever written.”<br />— Christiane
            Northrup, M.D.<br />Author of
            <i>Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdsom</i> and
            <i>The Wisdom of Menopause</i></b

            >“A user-friendly gift of intelligence, accessibility, and depth.”
            <br />—ELIZABETH LESSER<br />
            Co-founder of Omega Institute and author of
            <i>The Seeker’s Guide<br /><br /></i>Is astrology destiny?</b
          >
          Of course not! Your birth chart does not foresee a future written in
          stone, and predictive astrology is just a parlor game. The original
          purpose of astrology was to help you tap into your inner wisdom, ask
          yourself the right questions, and find your own answers to life’s
          challenges. Now this unconventional and refreshing guide helps you
          reconnect with the sea of intuition that flows through each of us—so
          you can discover your true purpose.<br /><br />Based upon the author’s
          nearly twenty years of experience as a professional astrologer, this
          amazing book gives you a secure orientation in the basic principles of
          astrology and teaches you highly effective techniques for identifying
          your talent, your passion, your spiritual support, and your connection
          to community.<br /><br />• Clear instructions on technically reading
          the planets, signs, and houses in your birth chart as well as a primer
          on the meaning of each<br />• Easy-to-follow intuitive exercises to
          connect with your “cosmic database,” a wellspring of creativity that
          encourages you to trust your potential and to love who you are in the
          present<br />• Helpful ways to trust your own limits and use them as
          inner teachers<br />• Twelve true life stories that illustrate the
          inspiring and uniquely brilliant way in which each of us can bring an
          astrological script to life<br /><br />If you are drawn to astrology
          but are intimidated by its apparent complexities, this generous,
          comprehensive book is the book for you. It presents the basics of
          astrology with crystal clarity and prepares you to use them with a
          subtle, finely honed precision that no other source provides. Even if
          you’re an experienced astrologer, you’ll be enlightened and stimulated
          by Elizabeth Rose Campbell’s affirmation: When you follow your best
          instincts, you follow the stars.<br /><br /><i><br /></i>

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Elizabeth Rose Campbell</b>&nbsp;(1952–2004) was the author
          of&nbsp;<i
            >Intuitive Astrology:&nbsp;Follow Your Best Instincts to Become Who
            You Always Intended to Be</i
          >. She&nbsp;graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel
          Hill with a degree in journalism in 1975. Though she initially worked
          as a writer for a literary magazine,&nbsp;<i>The Sun</i>:&nbsp;<i
            >A Magazine of Ideas</i
          >,&nbsp;Elizabeth was quickly drawn to the human potential movement
          and became a program coordinator for the Omega Institute for Holistic
          Studies in 1982. Based on earlier astrological studies with Steve
          Forrest, she began giving informal astrological consultations to Omega
          staff and faculty. Elizabeth became the first astrologer invited to
          offer consultations to participants at their Wellness Center. Her
          unique blend of intuition and the age-old science attracted a strong
          word-of-mouth following and led to the opening of her astrological
          firm Wild Rose Consulting in 1985. She advised celebrities, CEOs,
          painters, diplomats, athletes, teachers, writers, housewives,
          activists, and more, helping thousands to unlock their creative
          potential.
