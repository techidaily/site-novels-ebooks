            >Everyone is talking about mindfulness, but how does it actually
            work and how can it help you?</b
          ><br /><br />Mindfulness is a simple yet radical practice that can
          completely transform your life. Paddy Brosnan worked for many years as
          an investment advisor but felt trapped in a cycle of anxiety and
          anger. When he began practising mindfulness every day, he found that
          his relationships became more profound, his interactions with others
          more honest and his daily frustrations and anxieties simply vanished.
          In other words, mindfulness helped him calm down, and he became truly
          happy.<br /><br />This Works is the collection of tools and exercises
          that Paddy teaches in his workshops and events, and includes examples
          of everyday mindfulness from his own family life. It shows you that
          literally anyone can learn to meditate, and you don't have to become a
          Buddhist monk to be truly zen. Through simple daily exercises, you'll
          learn that mindfulness is not something you do, but something you
          are.<br /><br />Or, put simply, mindfulness can help you be truly
          happy.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Paddy Brosnan</b> lived and worked for over a decade in five
          European cities, advising high net-worth ex-pats on their investments.
          In his mid-30s he experienced a radical shift in how he wanted to live
          his life. He left the world of business and devoted the next decade to
          developing his awareness through the practice of mindfulness. He has
          gone on to teach tens of thousands of people in Ireland and
          internationally through his workshops and retreats.
