            The subtitle of this book is "Pick up the Mission, Then Drop the
            Mic." This book walks you through the life of Christ with a primary
            focus on the book of Luke in the Bible. It provides wisdom from
            Jesus' life as He lived out Our Father's business. Although this
            book is divided by topic, it largely maintains the chronology of
            events as they are captured in the book of Luke. The inspiration for
            this book came as result of many personal experiences. Being about
            our Father's business is bigger than any title in life.
            Professionally, I am an entrepreneur, an adjunct instructor, an
            attorney, a board director and officer, and many other titles.
            Personally, I am a wife, a daughter, a sister, a friend, a poet, an
            athlete. We all have many titles, but above all of these, there is a
            business, a mission, we have each been assigned to carry out. This
            book is written to remind and encourage you and me to "pick up the
            mission, then drop the mic." Picking up the mission refers to
            "bear[ing] [your] cross, and com[ing] after [Christ]." Dropping the
            mic refers to when a speaker or artist is on a stage, and says
            something so profound and final, leaving nothing else to be said
            afterwards. This is how our lives should be lived "" with such
            profundity that when our time on this earth is over, we can say, "I
            have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the
            faith," our physical death being our "drop the mic" moment. The
            specific challenges we face in deciding to answer God's call on our
            lives will be different for each of us. Some of the most difficult
            decisions will be choices between good (our plans) and best (God's
            plans for us). It is my prayer that you read this book and "pick up
            the mission" so that at the end of your life, you can "then drop the
            mic!"Click here to access the author's website!
