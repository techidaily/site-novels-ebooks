          After decades in which women have started to take control of their own
          lives and have stepped out of old roles and restrictions to become
          independent of men, the focus now turns to men. The question at hand
          is, “What now Adam?<br /><br />Men's liberation has not happened yet.
          Not only women but men also need a great liberation
          movement--liberation from the past, from the slavery of life-negating
          values and social conditionings that have been imposed upon them for
          thousands of years.<br /><br />"Man needs a new psychology to
          understand himself,“ says Osho, and the basic understanding that needs
          to be deeply imbibed and experienced is that no man is just male and
          no woman is just female; each man is both man and woman, and so is
          each woman - woman and man. Adam has Eve in him, and Eve has Adam in
          her. In fact, nobody is just Adam and nobody is just Eve: we are
          Adam-Eves. This is one of the greatest insights ever attained.<br /><br />But
          throughout history men have been conditioned to deny and reject their
          feminine qualities, to suppress their so-called "feminine" responses
          and feelings, and this has been reflected in the suppression of the
          female element in the outer world. Unless each man can start to
          discover his own inner woman, he is going to be tied up in a
          frustrating search for female qualities on the outside, in the outer
          woman. Each man needs to reintegrate his feminine qualities in order
          to become healthy and whole, complete within himself.<br /><br />Unless
          the individual man starts to come out of his robot-like, mechanical
          functioning and unawareness and begins to live his life with
          self-love, awareness, and deep respect for his real nature, there
          seems to be no chance that our world can escape global suicide.<br /><br />"Being
          a man or being a woman is an accident" says Osho. "Just like being a
          German or an Indian is an accident, being black or white is an
          accident – all of these things are not our choices - but you are lost
          in the accidents! You are too worried about them, your whole time and
          energy is wasted in them, and you become so occupied with the
          non-essential that the essential is forgotten."<br /><br />The
          essential for Osho is what he calls the being – simply the being –
          which is not accidental, but is destined. Rather than trying to figure
          out what it is to be a man, Osho suggests to find “that which is
          absolutely destined. That is your nature, that is your essence.”<br /><br />In
          his playful and insightful way Osho looks at all of the different
          facets of the varying roles men play, showing how these qualities have
          shaped and influenced society. He shows how energies that are so often
          channeled into aggression and negativity can be transformed into
          creativity and personal evolution, and provides meditative techniques
          as a practical aid to moving through this process.<br /><br />The book
          functions as a mirror, using common archetypes to structure the wealth
          of material that is available from Osho on the subject of Men's
          Liberation. These archetypes - Adam, The Robot, The Beggar, The Lover,
          The Politician, The Gambler, The Creator, and so on - should not be
          understood as fixed types of character or personality but simply
          useful descriptions of certain tendencies, conditionings, and trained
          behavior patterns of the personality, common to all of us.<br /><br />As
          Osho indicates, our reality lies beyond all these stereotypes and
          categories. The archetypal concepts are used to help us recognize our
          particular mind-sets and then move beyond the mind’s limitations and
          confinements. To go beyond the personality and discover the original
          face, the real and essential self.
