            >A guide to intuitive animal communication with a human-first
            approach, detailing how to do personal work in order to improve your
            communication with animals, and diving into specific tools for
            communication and how to co-create and manifest with your animal.</b
          ><br /><br />Have you ever wondered what your animal is thinking and
          feeling? Or wanted to know what you can do to help them live their
          best life?<br /><br />Here, celebrated animal communicator and animal
          behaviorist Michael R. Burke, teaches you how. He brings together all
          of his signature processes, tools, and techniques to help you
          strengthen your intuitive abilities so that you may do just that: help
          you and your animals—no matter if you have a dog, a cat, or another
          creature—feel calmer, more balanced, and fulfilled as you co-create a
          joyful life together.<br /><br />But first, you have to put on your
          own oxygen mask. It’s important to cultivate clear, calm, confident
          energy before interacting with animals, and Michael offers exercises
          to help you build this foundation. You will learn about journaling and
          mindfulness as methods for balancing your own energy and improving
          your animal communication, and practice recognizing and interpreting
          energy in all forms. These tools are essential, and will set you up
          for success when it comes to animal communication. Then, you can move
          into the specific communication techniques, including:<br /><br />·
          creating an internal database of signs and symbols to help you
          interpret and understand your communication with animals<br />·
          specific techniques for intuitive, energetic, and telepathic
          communication, both in-person and remote<br />· communicating with
          animals in the afterlife<br />· calling upon spirit animals and power
          animals<br />· the differences in communicating with wild animals
          compared to domesticated animals<br />· connecting and communicating
          with lost animals<br />· co-creating your best life with your animal
