            In a world that pushes us to always look for the next best thing,
            Blooming into Mindfulness shows you how to break the cycle of
            discontent and take control of your own happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Narrated with humor and raw honesty, Martha Brettschneider shares
            her transformation from ego-centered screaming mommy to a
            meditation-touting creative, finally at peace with the world.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspirational, motivational, and sprinkled with practical tips to
            silence our internal bully (the first step: recognizing that not all
            of our thoughts are to be trusted!), Blooming into Mindfulness is a
            must-read for anyone in search of an extra dose of internal peace.

          "Brettschneider turns life experiences surrounding her mastectomy into
          a delightful and interesting read chock full of humor, honesty,
          emotion, and wisdom. Her similes and cultural references create
          distinct pictures that will cement the ideas into your mind. 'Weeding
          became more than weeding,' she writes. 'I discovered myself clawing
          and stabbing at the earth with my trowel, gritting my teeth as I
          unearthed the roots of invasive, unwanted plants like so many cancer
          cells.' Pure gold."- Janet Sheppard Kelleher, Amazon Best Selling
          Author of Big C, little ta-ta: Kicking Cancer's Butt in 7 Humorous
          Stories "I loved the humor and self reflection in this well-written
          memoir! Brettschneider takes us on a very relatable journey of home,
          hearth, career and WHAT'S NEXT? As she handles the curves thrown at
          her, she moves from a place of doing and striving to a place of
          acceptance and being. I loved the way she compared this process to the
          work in a garden. Looking for more contentment and calm in your life?
          This book is for you!"- Anna Whiston Donaldson, New York Times Best
          Selling Author of Rare Bird: A Memoir of Loss and Love In Blooming
          into Mindfulness, Martha Brettschneider takes us along on her
          rollercoaster ride from left-brain economist, to reluctant suburbanite
          complete with minivan carpool, through breast cancer, and ultimately
          to transformation into the mindfulness she didn't know she was
          seeking. Instead of being just another tale of how surviving cancer
          changed one woman's life, this eloquent memoir gives the reader a
          roadmap for taking our own path toward finding a more joyous life. The
          story is universal, but the author's expressive writing made it
          relevant to my own journey. I found myself highlighting large passages
          and stopping often to search the links to the mentors and resources
          the author includes. I am typically not a fan of memoir, but this
          excellent book goes far beyond one woman's story to become a study in
          the blossoming of self-awareness that's well worth reading - and
          rereading.- Carol M. Olmstead, Feng Shui Master Practitioner, author,
          speaker, and owner of Feng Shui For Real Life "BLOOMING INTO
          MINDFULNESS is a warm and wonderful story from Martha's own life. Her
          words fill my senses and her images lead me out into my own [very
          weedy] garden for a closer look for hidden wonders. I can smell and
          feel the clammy rain-soaked earth as she tries to finish a night-time
          planting in the rain with 'swamp monster paws'. Her wry sense of
          humour and willingness to share her vulnerabilities connects me to her
          journey, and I feel lighter for it. Thank you so much for sharing
          yourself. I love the book and will definitely be buying extra copies
          for girlfriends' birthday gifts this year."-Melanie Mayell,
          Photographer, Artist &amp; Author, Winner of 2014 Living Now Book
          Awards Gold Medal, Founder of Thankyou Project
