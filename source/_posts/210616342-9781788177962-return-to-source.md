            ><i>Return To Source</i> invites Black people around the world to
            reconnect with their lost heritage and find healing, self-love and
            transformation.</b
          ><br /><br />This book is an empowering call to journey home to a new
          way of looking after yourself. A new way that is, in fact, the old
          way.<br /><br />Globally, Africans and Diasporans are rediscovering
          that, even while navigating an oppressive and often unsafe world, we
          are called to make space for healing, not just for ourselves but also
          for loved ones, Ancestors and descendants. Our path to liberation
          includes a commitment to nurturing our personal and community growth
          by making wellness a priority. In this powerful book, Araba
          Ofori-Acquah will help you to:<br /><br />embark on a spiritual,
          emotional and – for some – physical journey back to the Motherland,
          back to your heritage, back to yourself, back to source <br />unlock
          your potential with the power of an African-centred approach to
          wellness <br />incorporate the three seeds of African wellness – music
          and movement, Mother Earth and magick – into your routine
          <br />demystify and undo the demonisation of African beliefs, rituals
          and practices <br />create a path to healing that feels most authentic
          to you <br /><b

          The veil is being lifted. We are now experiencing what I call an
          African Renaissance. A rebirth of art, fashion, food, writing, myth,
          magic and wisdom teachings. What was once deemed primitive is finally
          recognized for the Healing power and wellness it induces. Araba
          Ofori-Acquah’s book <i>Return to Source</i> is part of the wave that
          is returning us to Africa. And in these pages, you will find a helpful
          reworking of wellness tools for black people direct from the Source. -

          >
          is a very important book. It makes African Spirituality accessible to
          the reader. [Araba] returns us to the Original Principles of the
          Culture, those ideas that can be found everywhere. She recounts the
          challenges the culture has endured and clarifies the gifts that have
          come out of that struggle. And most important, she returns to those
          Principles and provides the reader with guidelines to apply that
          wisdom to the requirements of contemporary life. It is an easy read, a
          pleasurable read, and a very necessary one. Enjoy and be enriched. -

          Personal Charms and Practical Rituals<br /><br />With
          <i>Return to Source</i>, Araba Ofori-Acquah gifts us with sacred
          ancestral medicine on the page. At this very moment the majority of
          our human brothers and sisters are crying out for reconnection – to
          ourselves, to each other, to the Source of All That Is. I am proud and
          excited to add this book to my favorite inspirational offerings. I
          highly recommend that you do the same. This is wellness custom-made
          for us. And for this sacred offering, I am so very grateful. - Abiola
