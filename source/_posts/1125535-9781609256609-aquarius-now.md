            What Thomas Paine did for the American Revolution with the
            publication of<i> Common Sense</i>, Marilyn Ferguson does for the
            transpersonal revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Marilyn Ferguson is one of the preeminent thinkers, gatherers, and
            interpreters of research on the cutting-edge fields of human
            consciousness. <i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i>, published in 1980,
            has sold millions of copies, is continuously in print, and was
            hailed as the "handbook of the New Age," by <i>USA Today</i>. In her
            newer book, <i>Aquarius Now</i>, movement pioneer Ferguson
            reexamines the paradigm shift to a more mindful society. She sees us
            caught in a mindless materialism that threatens our material
            existence. We are seduced by what she calls the ‘Cult of Numbers’,
            obsessed with competition, with winning and losing, afraid of
            anything that can't be seen or measured, and in the grip of an
            economic model that says only that which generates economic growth
            is worth pursuing.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            What can we do? Ferguson boldly tells the truth--we have no enemy
            except ourselves and the mess we've made individually and
            collectively by refusing to see what we're doing to our own bodies,
            to society, and the Earth itself. We've refused to consider the
            clues in front of our faces. The imbalance we see outside ourselves
            only mirrors the imbalance within. The way to heal the imbalance is
            to heal ourselves. The way to heal ourselves is to pay attention, to
            witness.
          </p>
          <p>
            We need to take responsibility for our own actions. We need to heed
            the words of the myriad teachers and skills at our disposal. We need
            to learn to rely on our own "radical common sense." &nbsp;The task
            is not to climb a mountain, but to navigate a river. We have to stop
            thinking of ourselves as conquerors and start thinking of ourselves
            as fellow travelers' with other human beings and every living being
            on this planet, including the planet itself.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Ferguson dares to ask the question, "Can we change?" and concludes
            that we can and we must change. The Age of Aquarius will occur when
            we want it to occur.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Marilyn Ferguson published <i>Brain/Mind Bulletin</i> from 1975-1995.
          Her work not only culled the best of the new consciousness movement
          and put the word out, but also offered commentary and insight that
          helped launch a whole new way of looking at ourselves and the world we
          live in. She published the bestselling
          <i>The Aquarian Conspiracy</i> in 1980 (the 25th anniversary edition
          was published by Tarcher/Penguin in 2005). Voted the most important
          new age book of the 1980s, this book has remained in print
          continuously for a quarter of a century.
