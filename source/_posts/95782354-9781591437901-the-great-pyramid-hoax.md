          Reveals how the only hard evidence that dates the Great Pyramid--the
          quarry marks discovered by Colonel Vyse in 1837--was forged <br />
          <br />• Includes evidence from the time of the discovery of the marks:
          Vyse’s private field notes, surveys, facsimile drawings, and
          eye-witness testimony <br />
          <br />• Explains why Vyse was driven to perpetrate a fraud inside the
          Great Pyramid <br />
          <br />• Examines recent chemical analysis of the marks and
          high-definition photos to reveal errors and other anomalies within the
          forged Khufu cartouche <br />
          <br />Despite millennia of fame, the origins of the Great Pyramid of
          Giza are shrouded in mystery. Believed to be the tomb of an Egyptian
          king, even though no remains have ever been found, its construction
          date of roughly 2550 BCE is tied to only one piece of evidence: the
          crudely painted marks within the pyramid’s hidden chambers that refer
          to the 4th Dynasty king Khufu, discovered in 1837 by Colonel Howard
          Vyse and his team. <br />
          <br />Using evidence from the time of the discovery of these “quarry
          marks”--including surveys, facsimile drawings and Vyse’s private field
          notes--along with high definition photos of the actual marks, Scott
          Creighton reveals how and why the marks were faked. He investigates
          the anomalous and contradictory orthography of the quarry marks
          through more than 75 photos and illustrations, showing how they
          radically depart from the established canon of quarry marks from this
          period. He explains how the orientation of the Khufu cartouche
          contradicts ancient Egyptian writing convention and how one of the
          signs is from a later period. Analyzing Vyse’s private diary, he
          reveals Vyse’s forgery instructions to his two assistants, Raven and
          Hill, and what the anachronistic sign should have been. He examines
          recent chemical analysis of the marks along with the eye-witness
          testimony of Humphries Brewer, who worked with Vyse at Giza in 1837
          and saw forgery take place. Exploring Vyse’s background, including his
          electoral fraud to become a member of the British Parliament, he
          explains why he was driven to perpetrate a fraud inside the Great
          Pyramid. <br />
          <br />Proving Zecharia Sitchin’s claim that the quarry marks are
          forgeries and removing the only physical evidence that dates the Great
          Pyramid’s construction to the reign of Khufu, Creighton’s study
          strikes down one of the most fundamental assertions of orthodox
          Egyptologists and reopens long-standing questions about the Great
          Pyramid’s true age, who really built it, and why.

          “Egyptologists consider the ochre-painted Khufu cartouche in the Great
          Pyramid as the ultimate proof that this pyramid belongs to the Fourth
          Dynasty pharaoh Khufu. But much controversy surrounds its
          authenticity. If the Khufu cartouche is indeed a hoax, then the
          implications are tremendous. Scott Creighton has undertaken a very
          bold and meticulous investigation into this mystery.
          <i>The Great Pyramid Hoax</i> is a must-read book for all seekers of
          truth.” Robert Bauval, author of The Soul of Ancient Egypt
