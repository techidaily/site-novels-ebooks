              connections between your chakras and your diet.</b
            ><br /><br /><i>Chakras, Food, and You </i>is a revolutionary
            approach that customizes health assessments based on the chakras—the
            ancient system that modern-day yogis exalt and the ancients across
            all cultures and periods embraced as the secret to enlightenment.
            After first taking the Chakra Type Quiz within the pages, you will
            learn which foods and supplements, exercises, and movements mesh to
            enable your individual body's peak performance. Then, you'll be
            equipped to make eating and lifestyle choices that synchronize with
            your real self. <br /><br />If you’re a First Chakra Manifestor,
            you’ll boost your adrenals by eating plenty of protein and taking
            extra minerals; you’ll eat when you are hungry and drive down stress
            by moving around. If you are a Third Chakra Thinker, you have to
            graze at set times. All twelve chakras—Manifestor, Creator, Thinker,
            Relator, Communicator, Visualizer, Spiritualist, Mystic, Harmonizer,
            Naturalist, Commander, as well as a twelfth special chakra, unique
            to each individual—are thoroughly covered.<br /><br />With
            additional tips and thoughts on meditation and spiritual practices,
            sleep protocols, stress-busters and relaxation practices, and
            self-care rituals and activities, Cyndi Dale and Dana Childs's
            <i>Chakras, Food, and You</i> is an accessible and straightforward
            health-and-life changer.
