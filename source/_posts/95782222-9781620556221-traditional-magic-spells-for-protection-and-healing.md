          An in-depth collection of ancient spells and magic practices drawn
          from rare and newly discovered texts <br /><br />• Presents more than
          600 magical prescriptions for healing and protection from both pagan
          and Christian sources <br /><br />• Examines the practice of
          diagnosing illness through magic and explores ancient beliefs about
          curses and other evil spells and about devils, demons, and ghosts
          <br /><br />• Includes spells from the heavily guarded gypsy tradition
          of magic and healing, drawn from newly discovered materials
          <br /><br />Since the beginning of history, people have sought
          remedies for the many ills that have beset them, from illnesses
          afflicting the body to threats posed by evil and hostile individuals.
          In many folk healing and pagan traditions, it was believed that one
          must gain the assistance of the guardian spirit of a healing plant or
          substance through prayers or offerings before its chemical properties
          would be effective. The Church decried these spells and practices as
          pagan superstition but did not seek to exterminate these beliefs,
          instead transferring the responsibility for their healing powers to
          the apostles and saints. <br /><br />Drawing on his extensive
          knowledge of ancient texts, Claude Lecouteux presents more than 600
          magical prescriptions from both pagan and Christian sources from the
          last 2,000 years, covering everything from abscesses and shingles to
          curses and healing animals. He examines the practice of diagnosing
          illness through magic and looks at the origins of disease according to
          the evolving beliefs of magic practitioners over the centuries. He
          explores ancient beliefs about curses and about devils, demons, and
          ghosts and provides an in-depth look at protection magic, including
          protection of health, animals, and cultivated land, protection against
          curses, witchcraft, bad weather, and beasts, protection of a home, and
          protection while traveling. He includes spells from the heavily
          guarded gypsy tradition of magic and healing, drawn from newly
          discovered materials collected by two Romanian ethnologists who lived
          and traveled with gypsies in Transylvania in the mid-19th century. The
          author also reproduces rare texts on magic healing from the 14th and
          15th centuries. <br /><br />Revealing the vitality of these practices
          in the remoter areas of Eastern Europe, Lecouteux shows how the
          influence of this pagan worldview is still detectable in the work of
          modern folk healers in France and Scandinavia. He also shows how the
          condemnation of unorthodox methods of healing has not vanished from
          the contemporary world: the medieval legislation against healing by
          wizards and bonesetters is echoed in modern health codes that
          challenge the authority of naturopaths and faith healers.
