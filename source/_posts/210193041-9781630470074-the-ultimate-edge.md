            >Save time, money, and heartache. A one-stop shop for
            self-improvement.&nbsp;“This book can be a great help to those ready
            for transformation.” —Bernie S. Siegel, MD, #1&nbsp;<i

          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Combining the art and science of over thirty years of Dr. Tina Thomas’
          experience as a gestalt therapist, this book gives you the tools to
          the “fire” of your personal problems rather than dealing with all the
          psychoanalytical “smoke.”<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Issues with work, goal achievement, anxiety, stress, depression,
          relationships?&nbsp;<i>The Ultimate Edge</i>&nbsp;gives you an edge in
          life by explaining how your brain creates your mental maps that
          initially protect you but ultimately can sabotage your life. You will
          learn how to change those mental maps so that, as far as your brain is
          concerned, you have an alternate past, which by default creates an
          alternate present and future, filled with liberating possibilities.
          Additionally, you will learn about the seven most misunderstood
          emotions and how to utilize them to your advantage. Finally, you will
          learn how to get your RAS in gear. The reticular activating system is
          a filter in the brain that, once activated, helps you to achieve your
          goals quickly and dynamically.&nbsp;<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          More than an owner’s manual for your brain,&nbsp;<i
            >The Ultimate Edge</i
          >&nbsp;is a guidebook to more peace, passion, and power than you ever
          imagined!<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><b
            >“A book that transcends advice and self-help books. It is a part of
            the realm of books that can genuinely assist the reader to do more
            than lose weight or dress better. It provides a roadmap to greater
            stability in life and provides readers with something that can aid
            them in accomplishing larger, life-changing goals.” —Dennis Boyles,
            former editor of&nbsp;<i>Men’s Health</i>&nbsp;magazine</b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Tina Thomas is the director of The Gestalt Institute and Relationship
          Center of New Orleans and the author of "Passion and Power" and "Who
          Do You Think You Are?" She has a PhD in biopsychology and is a
          registered nurse and board-certified social worker. A former trainer
          for SkillPath seminars, she was voted number one trainer out of 275
          trainers by her ninth month there, and in 2012 she was asked to be a
          TEDx speaker in Nova Scotia. She has also served as clinical director
          of Tulane Cancer Counseling Center and research professor at Duke. Her
          greatest accomplishment to date is the creation and development of her
          theory of the biological basis of human personality that she believes
          is the unifying paradigm for all of personality psychology. Tina has
          been a featured expert on personality for ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC.
