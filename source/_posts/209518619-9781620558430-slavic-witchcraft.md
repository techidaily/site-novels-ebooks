          A practical guide to the ancient magical tradition of Russian sorcery
          and Eastern Slavic magical rites <br /><br />• Offers step-by-step
          instructions for more than 300 spells, incantations, charms, amulets,
          and practical rituals for love, career success, protection, healing,
          divination, communicating with spirits and ancestors, and other
          challenges and situations <br /><br />• Reveals specific places of
          magical power in the natural world as well as the profound power of
          graveyards and churches for casting spells <br /><br />• Explores the
          folk history of this ancient magical tradition, including how the
          pagan gods gained new life as Eastern Orthodox saints, and shares
          folktales of magical beings, including sorceresses shapeshifting into
          animals and household objects <br /><br />Passed down through
          generations, the Slavic practice of magic, witchcraft, and sorcery is
          still alive and well in Russia, the Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as
          the Balkans and the Baltic states. There are still witches who whisper
          upon tied knots to curse or heal, sorceresses who shapeshift into
          animals or household objects, magicians who cast spells for love or
          good fortune, and common folk who seek their aid for daily problems
          big and small. <br /><br />Sharing the extensive knowledge she
          inherited from her mother and grandmother, including spells of the
          “Old Believers” previously unknown to outsiders, Natasha Helvin
          explores in detail the folk history and practice of Russian sorcery
          and Eastern Slavic magical rites, offering a rich compendium of more
          than 300 spells, incantations, charms, and practical rituals for love,
          relationships, career success, protection, healing, divination,
          averting the evil eye, communicating with spirits and ancestors, and a
          host of other life challenges and daily situations, with complete
          step-by-step instructions to ensure your magical goals are realized.
          She explains how this tradition has only a thin Christian veneer over
          its pagan origins and how the Slavic pagan gods and goddesses acquired
          new lives as the saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church. She details
          how the magical energy for these spells and rituals is drawn from the
          forces of nature, revealing specific places of power in the natural
          world as well as the profound power of graveyards and churches for
          casting spells. She explores the creation of amulets and talismans,
          the importance of icons, and the proper recital of magical language
          and actions during spells, as well as how one becomes a witch or
          sorceress. <br /><br />Offering a close examination of these
          two-thousand-year-old occult practices, Helvin also includes Slavic
          folk advice, adapted for the modern era. Revealing what it means to be
          a Slavic witch or sorceress, and how this vocation pervades all
          aspects of life, she shows that each of us has magic within that we
          can use to take control of our own destiny.
