          Can yoga and meditation unleash our inherent supernormal mental
          powers, such as telepathy, clairvoyance, and precognition? Is it
          really possible to perceive another person's thoughts and intentions?
          Influence objects with our minds? Envision future events? And is it
          possible that some of the superpowers described in ancient legends,
          science fiction, and comic books are actually real, and patiently
          waiting for us behind the scenes? Are we now poised for an
          evolutionary trigger to pull the switch and release our full
          potentials?<br /><br />Dean Radin, Director of Research at the
          Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) and bestselling author of
          <i>The Conscious Universe, </i>presents persuasive new experimental
          evidence for the existence of such phenomena. He takes us on a
          thrilling scientific journey and challenges outdated assumptions that
          these abilities are mere superstition. Focusing on Patanjali's
          mysterious <i>Yoga Sutras </i>-- 2,000 year-old meditation practices
          believed to release our extraordinary powers -- Radin offers powerful
          evidence confirming that sometimes fact is much stranger, spookier,
          and more wonderful than the wildest fiction.

          <i>“</i>In <i>Supernormal,</i> consciousness researcher Dr. Dean Radin
          shows compellingly that specific ancient claims about extraordinary
          psychic abilities are real, and how they have been confirmed by an
          outpouring of ingenious experiments whose statistical power is simply
          galactic. <i>Supernormal</i> is the crown jewel in Dr. Radin’s
          landmark trilogy, which also includes
          <i>The Conscious Universe</i> and <i>Entangled Minds.</i>&nbsp;
          <i>Supernormal</i> is a reader’s delight.&nbsp;Beautifully written, it
          is spiced with that rarest ingredient in science writing:&nbsp; humor.
          If this book does not take your breath away, it should, because it
          reveals how we can awaken to innate human potentials that are
          glorious, on which our future may depend. Thank you, Dr. Radin, for
          showing the way.” -- Larry Dossey, MD, author of <i>One Mind</i
          ><br /><br />"In the last 50 years, major discoveries in modern
          science increasingly support the wisdom and vision of the ancient
          philosophers and sages. Dean Radin’s work is a major step in the same
          context, showing us how the statements made by the ancient sages like
          Patanjali are supported by the current research conducted with
          strictest scientific protocols. Radin’s work seems to bear even
          greater promise of what is yet to come." --Swami Veda Bharati, D.
          Lit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />“Great advances in science are made by
          following the evidence, wherever it may lead. Adhering to this
          principle, internationally-known researcher and author Dean Radin
          convincingly demonstrates that psi phenomena invalidate the
          assumptions associated with the obsolete materialist worldview.
          Recognizing the fundamental aspect of mind and consciousness, Dr.
          Radin also explains why it is now time to significantly revise and
          expand our concepts about who we are and the ultimate nature of
          reality.” --Mario Beauregard, author of
          <i>The Spiritual Brain </i>and<i> Brain Wars<br /><br /></i>"As with
          Dr. Radin’s previous work, this book is thoroughly researched, clearly
          written, and immensely engaging. Once again he has pushed the
          boundaries of religion, science, psychology, and philosophy.
          Invaluable reading!" --Michael Bloch, University of San Francisco<br /><br />"Dean
          Radin is a modern-day Galileo of psychical research.&nbsp; He is an
          impeccable scholar and premier experimental scientist, and this is a
          terrific book.&nbsp; Come, look through his telescope; with great
          clarity, he goes right to the core of the most profound issues in the
          contemporary science of mind.&nbsp; By including a detailed review of
          a variety of experimental findings, this book presents in one easily
          accessible place a wealth of information, creating a valuable
          reference and teaching/learning resource for students and scholars
          alike.&nbsp; And by connecting all this with contemplative
          investigations of the nature of mind carried out over the course of
          millennia, this book makes an invaluable contribution to expanding the
          modern dialogue between science and the contemplative traditions."
          --David E. Presti, University of California, Berkeley<br /><br />“In
          <i>Supernormal,</i> Dean Radin skillfully weaves threads of Eastern
          praxis (yoga) and the results of Western psi experiments into a
          seamless and fascinating tapestry, one that portrays not merely who we
          are but what we might aspire to become.” --Daniel Sheehan
