          The goddess origins of the Statue of Liberty and her connections with
          the founding and the future of America <br />
          <br />• Examines Lady Liberty’s ties to Native American spiritual
          traditions, the Earth Mother, Roman goddesses, Black Madonnas, and
          Mary Magdalene <br />
          <br />• Reveals the sharp contrast between depicting “liberty” as a
          female and the reality of women and other suppressed classes even
          today <br />
          <br />• Explains how this Goddess of the New World inspires all people
          toward equality, compassion, peace-keeping, and environmental
          stewardship <br />
          <br />Uncovering the forgotten lineage of the Statue of Liberty, Bob
          Hieronimus and Laura Cortner explain how she is based on a female
          symbol representing America on the earliest maps of the continent in
          the form of a Native American “Queen.” The image of a woman
          symbolizing independence was embraced by the American revolutionaries
          to rally the populace against the King, filling the role of “Founding
          Mother” and protector of the fledgling republic. Incorporating
          Libertas, the Roman goddess of freed slaves, with Minerva, Demeter,
          Justice, and the Indian Princess, Lady Liberty is seen all over the
          nation’s capital, and on the seals and flags of many states. <br />
          <br />Showing how a new appreciation for the Statue of Liberty as the
          American goddess can serve as a unifying inspiration for activism, the
          authors explore how this Lady Liberty is a personification of America
          and its destiny. They examine multiple traditions that influenced her
          symbolism, from the Neolithic Earth Mother, to Mary Magdalene,
          Columbia, and Joan of Arc, while revealing the sharp contrast between
          depicting “liberty” as a female and the reality of women and other
          suppressed classes throughout history. Their study of “Liberty
          Enlightening the World” led them to conclude that the empowerment of
          contemporary women is essential for achieving sustainable liberty for
          all.<br />
          <br />Sounding the call for this “Goddess of the New World” to inspire
          us all toward peacekeeping, nurturing, compassion, and environmental
          stewardship, the authors explain how the Statue of Liberty serves as
          the conscience of our nation and is a symbol of both the myths that
          unite us and the diversity that strengthens us.

          “Who would have imagined that you could draw our country’s entire
          history through the iconic image of Liberty gracing the New York
          Harbor? That’s precisely what the authors do in this engaging and
          well-documented journey through the long-neglected outtakes of our
          past. The exploration of Native American and feminist history and
          values, combined with contemporary scientific research, lead us to
          envision a sustainable future where liberty indeed prevails.”
