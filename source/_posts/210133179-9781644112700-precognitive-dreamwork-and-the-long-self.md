          • Outlines a set of clear principles to help guide dreamworkers,
          illustrated through real precognitive dream experiences <br /><br />•
          Shows how to detect precognitive dreams through their characteristic
          features, explaining how dreams relate to memory and why dreams about
          future experiences are often symbolic or distorted <br /><br />•
          Explores the mind-blowing implications of precognition for our lives,
          including how our present thoughts actually shape--or shaped--our past
          <br /><br />Once only the stuff of science fiction, evidence has grown
          that precognition--glimpses of your future in dreams and visions and
          being influenced subtly in waking life by what is to come--is real.
          Your future thoughts and feelings shape who you are now. And your
          present thoughts and feelings shape--or shaped--your past.
          <br /><br />In this accessible exploration of precognition,
          precognitive dreamwork, and a radically new biographical sensibility,
          the Long Self, that precognition awakens us to, Eric Wargo shows how
          dreamworkers can play the role of citizen scientists, adding to our
          understanding of this fascinating, almost unexplored dimension of
          human life. Wargo outlines a set of clear principles to guide
          dreamworkers, each illustrated through real dreamers’ experiences.
          Drawing on psychoanalysis and contemporary sleep science, he explores
          how precognition relates to memory, explaining why dreams of future
          experiences are often distorted and what those distortions probably
          mean. He discusses never-before-described dream features, including
          “time gimmicks” (symbols hinting at time distortion) and “calendrical
          resonance” (the tendency of dreams to foretell experiences exactly a
          year or years later). He describes why an understanding of
          precognition augments Jung’s theory of synchronicity by highlighting
          our own role in producing meaningful coincidences in our waking lives.
          He also shows how precognition manifests in other states of
          consciousness like lucid dreams, out-of-body experiences, trance
          states, sleep paralysis, meditation, and hypnagogia. <br /><br />We
          are at a major turning point in science’s understanding of time,
          causality, and the self. We are more than who we think we are from
          moment to moment--we are our past, present, and future simultaneously.
          When we understand this, a dream journal becomes a personal time
          machine, with mind-blowing discoveries in store for the traveler.

          "A definite step into the quantum world of consciousness. I have often
          wondered if some of my dreams were warnings or simply clues about the
          future; after reading this book I have a much better and clear
          understanding of some of the deeper conscious levels I’ve experienced.
          One thing is for sure, we are not going to get any solutions that will
          solve our complex problems from the everyday level of awareness that
          most people have, and it no longer takes a genius to figure that out.
          It’s encouraging to read new information that is so vital in today’s
          world."
