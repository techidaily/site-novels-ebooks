            Have you ever wondered if you are psychic? Have you been told you
            are deeply intuitive? Do you ever have a sense that something will
            happen—and then it <i>does</i>? Have you ever had a strong feeling
            or dream that someone you care about needed your help and it turned
            out to be true? If so, you may be psychically gifted. Psychic
            experiences are nothing to be afraid of. In fact, they can greatly
            enrich your life! So, how can you further deepen your intuition and
            open your psychic senses?

          “If you picked up this book, you have psychic gifts. We live in a
          culture that systematically trains us to ignore our inner wisdom,
          which means that most of us go through life feeling vaguely cut off
          from important parts of ourselves. Lisa Campion is your guide as you
          restore the connection to your natural powers. Want more flow,
          insight, and astounding experiences of what’s possible in your life?
          This book will show you how to recover and use your inherent psychic
          gifts.”<br /><b>—Jacob Nordby</b>, author of <i>The Creative Cure</i>
