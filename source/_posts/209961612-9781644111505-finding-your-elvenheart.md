          A guide to untaming yourself on a quest to discover your inner Sidhe
          nature, your ElvenHeart, for wholeness, healing, and awakening
          <br /><br />• Explores who the Sidhe are and shares close encounters
          with them in our modern world <br /><br />• Invites you to discover
          your ElvenHeart by journeying through the four portals of the
          StoneAnchor, the FlowDancer, the FireDreamer, and the WindSinger
          <br /><br />• Offers gifts in the form of simple exercises to bring
          you into contact with your magical kin and rewild yourself
          <br /><br />Awaken to your closest kin, the Sidhe (pronounced “Shee”),
          and let them inspire you to rediscover your gentle, wild, innermost
          nature, your ElvenHeart. Also known as the Faery People or the Good
          Neighbors, the Sidhe are not just figments of human imagination. They
          are reaching out to us, encouraging a reunion with humanity, and
          inviting us to partner with them in restoring wholeness to the world.
          As they reveal, serving Gaia or healing the Earth from the present
          crisis is not a convenience--it is a necessity. <br /><br />Offering
          an experiential guide to reconnecting with the Sidhe and our inner
          ElvenHeart, Søren Hauge explores who the Sidhe are, how both humanity
          and the Sidhe emerged from a common ancestor, and how their untamed
          nature and deep wisdom bears significance for an aspect of our inner
          being that has gone to sleep. While the Sidhe did not enter the
          physical dimension as deeply as we did, they are real beings, very
          close to us, and different from angels, devas, and nature spirits.
          Søren introduces his own Sidhe contact, Fjeldur, and shares close
          encounters others have had with these beings in our modern world. He
          also takes you on a journey of rewilding through four portals--the
          StoneAnchor, the FlowDancer, the FireDreamer, and the WindSinger--to
          discover the treasure of your ElvenHeart at the core of your being. In
          the course of this, Søren offers gifts in the form of simple exercises
          that help bring you into contact with your magical kin and your inner
          Sidhe nature. <br /><br />Through this wild quest, the journey of
          untaming yourself, you will connect with your Sidhe partners, unfold
          their inner gifts in your own being, and rediscover the forgotten land
          of innocent wildness and gentle power within you.
