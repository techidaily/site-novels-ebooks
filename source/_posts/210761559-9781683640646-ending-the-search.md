            <i>What is life when seeking ends?</i><br /><i
              >Just what is, nothing more or less—</i
            ><br /><i>an ordinary person doing ordinary things,</i><br /><i
              >not wishing to be more or less,</i
            ><br /><i>content to simply be herSelf.</i><br />—Dorothy Hunt,
            <i>Only This</i><br />Do you ever feel as if your spiritual search
            is getting you nowhere? That despite sincere intention and effort,
            you’re reaping frustration instead of fruit? In
            <i>Ending the Search,</i> Dorothy Hunt unravels a dilemma that has
            vexed countless people on a spiritual path. “You may have tried all
            manner of practices, meditation, guru shopping, chanting, prayer,
            and still you have not attained your heart’s desire,” she writes.
            “This book is about the ego’s spiritual ambition, its search for its
            idea of ‘enlightenment,’ its struggles and its eventual fate as
            seeker becomes the sought.”<br /><i>Ending the Search</i> explores
            the deep spiritual impulse to awaken and the ways a future-focused
            mind “co-opts” or veils what is timelessly free, loving, and ever
            present. Dorothy invites us to follow our longing for truth, love,
            or enlightenment back to their source—the Heart that is beckoning us
            beyond separation. While describing and honoring different practices
            and paths taken in one’s search for Truth, she emphasizes the
            practice of self-inquiry as taught by Ramana Maharshi. We are
            invited to search not for an idea of something “out there,” but for
            the true identity of the seeker, the unnamable Mystery that is
            compassionately aware, existing right now in each of us. The book
            also looks at the processes of embodiment and surrender, the need
            for “ruthless honesty” without self-judgment, and in its concluding
            section, shares a vision of life lived authentically.<br />“The
            spiritual search is a call to remember who or what you essentially
            are,” explains Dorothy Hunt. “What ends the search is actually
            present from the very beginning, beckoning you to come Home. In
            truth, you are what you seek, yet you must make the discovery for
            yourself.” This is your invitation, with
            <i>Ending the Search</i>.<br />Highlights:<br />• The nature of
            spiritual ambition<br />• When practice becomes problematic<br />•
            How the thinking mind separates us from the moment<br />• Silence
            and stillness, our greatest teachers<br />• Ego and the trance of
            separation<br />• The human heart as a doorway to the infinite<br />•
            The freedom of Presence<br />• The price of Realization<br />•&nbsp;Gurus,
            spiritual teachers, and charlatans<br />• Undoing core egoic
            beliefs<br />• Resting the mind in the Heart of Awareness
