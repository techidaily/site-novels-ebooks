          “Radleigh Valentine has penned a fun, inviting, enthusiastic, and very
          special book. He deftly manages to weave angels, wish fulfillment,
          manifesting your best life, and personal stories (some poignant, but
          most hilarious) with glitter, love, and a heartfelt honesty and
          integrity that’s so refreshing in the spiritual self-help world. You
          will smile through it all and remember who you really are. You’ll
          learn that life is magic, you are magic, and there is nothing stopping
          you from living your best life! Bravo, Radleigh, for sharing your
          fabulous joy and miracle-making secrets with all of us!”—
