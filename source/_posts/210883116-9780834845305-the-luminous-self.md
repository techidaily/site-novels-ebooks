            ><br />A guide to self-remembrance with practices, meditations, and
            self-inquiry questions inspired by yoga and Tantra to help you
            connect with your inner wisdom, remember your wholeness, and live
            with clarity and compassion—by the bestselling author of
            <i>Radiant Rest.</i></b
          ><br /><br /><br /><i>The Luminous Self </i>shares teachings and
          practices that can help us connect with our true Self and reclaim our
          inherent power and wisdom—essential for living with purpose and grace
          in our turbulent world. In this book, Tracee Stanley shares teachings
          and practices in each chapter—including meditation, yoga nidra, breath
          work, dreaming rituals, community care practices, journaling, and
          more—that can help us remember and honor our deepest Self.<br /><br />The
          book is a journey of inner exploration for anyone who desires to know
          themselves more deeply. Chapters introduce different paths to personal
          discernment—including facing obstacles to liberation, forgiveness, the
          power of memory, transitions as portals to wisdom and devotion, and
          nature as a teacher—and include stories from Stanley's life,
          teachings, and practice. 6 audio practices accompany the book.

          “Tracee Stanley has gifted the world with another incredible and
          one-of-a-kind resource that is filled with countless gems of her
          grounded and embodied wisdom. <i>The Luminous Self </i>is an
          experiential and restorative guidebook that reminds us that Yoga is
          truly a state of being and that our spiritual practices and rituals
          are a sacred way of reconnecting us to our deepest selves. With
          compassion, nuance, and profound magic (in the way only Tracee can
          do), this book introduces us to the life-shifting practices of ritual,
          embodiment, movement, meditation, rest, and Yoga nidra. Deeply
          nourishing and simultaneously awakening—you will not be the same
          person when you are finished.”—Zahabiyah Yamasaki, author of
          <i>Trauma-Informed Yoga for Survivors of Sexual Assault</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Tracee Stanley is emerging as a global&nbsp;leader in the realm of a
          new and needed embodied spirituality. <i>The Luminous Self</i> allows
          us to penetrate life’s deepest and most transcendent question—<i
            >Who am I? </i
          >She adeptly walks us into the murky ground of this inquiry through
          both new and time-tested yogic technologies that allow us to release
          our old identities while simultaneously honoring our body, ancestry,
          and past experience.”—Katie Silcox, author of
          <i>Happy, Healthy, Sexy</i><br />
          <i> </i><br />
          “Tracee&nbsp;Stanley’s teaching is pure transmission; the clarity of
          her self-respect is of benefit to us all.
          <i>The Luminous Self</i> carries us to the heart with applicable,
          profound practices, providing a structure to nourish both intimacy and
          freedom within ourselves.”—Elena Brower, author of
          <i>Practice You</i> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “There are practices and teachings&nbsp;within this book that will
          change the course of your&nbsp;destiny. <i>The Luminous Self</i> is a
          portal to the inner realms where anything is possible”—Kim Krans,
          artist and creator of <i>The Wild Unknown Tarot<br /><br /></i>“Tracee
          Stanley's book arrives in an age when people are thirsting for an
          authentic path to the true Self.&nbsp;This beautiful and deep book is
          the dip of cool water needed to&nbsp;slake that thirst.”—Acharya
          Shunya, author of <i><i>Sovereign Self</i></i
          ><br />
          <b> </b><br />
          “It is time to&nbsp;collectively&nbsp;wake up and remember who&nbsp;we
          are before our forgetfulness causes any more harm to us, all sentient
          beings, and the planet. <i>The Luminous Self</i> is not only a book—it
          is already a good Ancestor who whispers to us,&nbsp;‘This, this is the
          way.’ You are not lost; follow the ray that points toward
          <i>The Luminous Self</i>.”—Octavia Raheem, author of
          <i>Pause, Rest, Be</i><br /><br />
          “This work of art speaks to the undoing that meets us all at our
          proverbial front door when we dive into an inquiry and practice how to
          heal ourselves and find peace amid a chaotic world and landscape.
          Tracee provides a soft container that feels like the wisest guidance
          for the unraveling and undoing as well as practices and tools for the
          journey back into wholeness and truth.”—Michelle Cassandra Johnson,
          author of <i>We Heal Together</i><br /><br />
          “<i>The Luminous Self</i> is a bright and effulgent light in the
          darkness. Tracee Stanley has drawn open the curtains and allowed the
          sun to shine into our minds and hearts. With compassion and courage,
          she carves away our confusion regarding these ancient, esoteric
          spiritual teachings to reveal what has been there all along: We are
          already whole and full. The light we’re seeking is within us.”—Jivana
          Heyman, author of <i>Yoga Revolution</i>
