          An in-depth study of the sacred meanings behind ancient and enduring
          symbols <br />
          <br />• Explains the multiple forms and uses of symbols from ancient
          times to the present day, reflecting their roots in folk magic and the
          Western Mystery tradition <br />
          <br />• Examines more than 40 glyphs, such as the cross, fleur de lis,
          and pentagram, as well as several families of symbols, such as
          craftsmen’s marks and runes <br />
          <br />• Includes more than 300 unique woodcuts, drawings, calligraphy,
          and photographs--many never before reproduced <br />
          <br />From ancient rock and cave art to the contemporary brand logos
          of politics and business, human beings have always created symbols to
          denote specific ideas, groups, or important objects as well as to
          convey deeper information than can be communicated in words. Many
          glyphs have retained their meanings over millennia whereas some have
          modern meanings vastly different from the original connotation. In
          this study of symbols, Nigel Pennick explores glyphs as agents of
          higher consciousness and ports of access to the collective
          unconscious, acknowledging the continuity of tradition, both
          deliberate and not, as well as how interpretations of some symbols,
          such as the swastika, have changed dramatically. <br />
          <br />With more than 300 unique woodcuts, drawings, calligraphy, and
          photographs--many never before reproduced--Pennick examines ancient
          and enduring glyphs in detail, such as the circle, cross, eye,
          pentagram, fleur de lis, tree of life, and horseshoe, as well as
          several families of symbols, such as craftsmen’s marks, runes,
          symbolic beasts, human heads and skulls, and the sigils of Mammon. The
          author explains the multiple forms and uses of each from ancient times
          to the present day, reflecting their roots in the Western Mystery
          tradition. He explores the symbols of high magic such as the glyph of
          John Dee’s monad, those of folk magic such as the traditional cock on
          the weather vane, and the creation of modern glyphs such as the peace
          sign and the anarchy symbol. <br />
          <br />Contrasting the hi-jacked use of power symbols in modern
          advertising with the vital role of symbols in traditional arts and
          crafts, Pennick reveals how symbols link the cosmic with the
          terrestrial and allow us to infuse the mundane with the numinous.

          occult as an immensely valuable survey of symbols from an author with
