          An encyclopedic compendium of the myths and actual events from
          humanity’s ancient civilizations that reveal the influence of visitors
          from the 12th planet--the Anunnaki <br />
          <br />• Offers easy access to the myriad characters and subjects
          covered by the seven books of The Earth Chronicles series <br />
          <br />• Provides alphabetical listings to the terminology of ancient
          civilizations concerning their gods, kings, cultures, and religions
          <br />
          <br />• Contains detailed summations, commentaries, and instructions
          for locating topics within all the author’s books <br />
          <br />The Earth Chronicles series, a historical and archaeological
          adventure into the origins of mankind and planet Earth, began with the
          publication of the bestselling <i>The 12th Planet</i>. The series is
          based on the premise that the myths from the world’s earliest
          civilizations were in fact recollections of actual events and that the
          gods of ancient peoples were visitors to Earth from another
          planet--the Anunnaki, inhabitants of the 12th planet. The series’
          books include
          <i
            >The 12th Planet, The Stairway to Heaven, The Wars of Gods and Men,
            The Lost Realms, When Time Began, The Cosmic Code</i
          >, and <i>The End of Days</i>, all products of the author’s unmatched
          study of the ancient records of Sumer, Babylonia, Assyria, Israel, and
          Egypt and the civilizations of pre-Columbian America. Unearthing the
          hidden history of Earth and mankind, the series uses the past to
          unveil the meaning of the prophesied future. <br />
          <br />Zecharia Sitchin has created an encyclopedic compendium of the
          key figures, sites, concepts, and beliefs to provide a unique
          navigational tool through this entire opus. Entries are coded to
          indicate at a glance their cultural origin and contain summations,
          commentaries, and guidance for locating the topics within all of his
          books, including
          <i
            >Genesis Revisited, Divine Encounters, The Lost Book of Enki, The
            Earth Chronicles Expeditions</i
          >, and <i>Journeys to the Mythical Past</i>.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Zecharia Sitchin (1920-2010), an eminent Orientalist and biblical
          scholar, was born in Russia and grew up in Palestine, where he
          acquired a profound knowledge of modern and ancient Hebrew, other
          Semitic and European languages, the Old Testament, and the history and
          archaeology of the Near East. A graduate of the University of London
          with a degree in economic history, he worked as a journalist and
          editor in Israel for many years prior to undertaking his life’s
          work--The Earth Chronicles. <br />
          <br />One of the few scholars able to read the clay tablets and
          interpret ancient Sumerian and Akkadian, Sitchin based The Earth
          Chronicles series on the texts and pictorial evidence recorded by the
          ancient civilizations of the Near East. His books have been widely
          translated, reprinted in paperback editions, converted to Braille for
          the blind, and featured on radio and television programs.
