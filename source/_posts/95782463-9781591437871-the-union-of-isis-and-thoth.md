          An initiatic guide to temple construction on the spiritual and
          physical planes <br />
          <br />• Details the initiations for consecrating yourself as a divine
          vessel <br />
          <br />• Guides you in building a sacred inner temple for connecting
          with the gods of Egypt <br />
          <br />• Delivers shamanic journeys and initiations on ascension,
          shamanic death and renewal, soul retrieval and healing,
          multidimensional realities, and more <br />
          <br />Deep within each of us lives a primal memory of a time when the
          natural world was recognized as divine and our temples were built from
          sacred materials enlivened through magic. Temples were not places you
          visited once a week; they were centers of community, divine work,
          healing, and wisdom, places where Heaven and Earth meet. This union of
          Heaven and Earth--the sacred temple--is also a union of Thoth and
          Isis: the Egyptian god of wisdom and the creative cosmic force and the
          Egyptian goddess of civilizing knowledge. Their relationship
          established the celestial teachings on Earth, for Thoth taught Isis
          all the mysteries and magic she knows and Isis acted as Thoth’s
          instrument to deliver the teachings in a form humanity could use.
          <br />
          <br />In this initiatic guide to temple building on the spiritual and
          physical planes, Normandi Ellis and Nicki Scully explain how to create
          a communal spiritual structure for connecting with the ancient
          Egyptian pantheon as well as how to consecrate yourself and become a
          vessel suitable for divine wisdom and a home for your personal gods.
          The authors detail the construction, shamanic visioning, and ritual
          consecration of a Moon Temple dedicated to Thoth. They explore
          teachings that help you develop relationships with the Egyptian neteru
          and realize your place within the family of the Egyptian pantheon.
          They guide you as you create your inner heart temple, the adytum, a
          safe place in which to receive guidance and access your higher
          spiritual bodies and oracular gifts. They provide shamanic journeys
          and initiations on ascension, shamanic death and renewal, soul
          retrieval and healing, multidimensional realities, and more. <br />
          <br />By creating a sacred temple within and without, we each can take
          part in the union of Isis and Thoth and restore the magic of the
          Egyptian mysteries to our time.
