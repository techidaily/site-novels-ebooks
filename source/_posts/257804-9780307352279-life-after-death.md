          Deepak Chopra has touched millions of readers by demystifying our
          deepest spiritual concerns while retaining their poetry and wonder.
          Now he turns to the most profound mystery: What happens after we die?
          Is this one question we were not meant to answer, a riddle whose
          solution the universe keeps to itself? Chopra tells us there is
          abundant evidence that “the world beyond” is not separated from this
          world by an impassable wall; in fact, a single reality embraces all
          worlds, all times and places. At the end of our lives we “cross over”
          into a new phase of the same soul journey we are on right this
          minute.<br /><br />In <i>Life After Death</i>, Chopra draws on
          cutting-edge scientific discoveries and the great wisdom traditions to
          provide a map of the afterlife. It’s a fascinating journey into many
          levels of consciousness. But far more important is his urgent message:
          Who you meet in the afterlife and what you experience there reflect
          your present beliefs, expectations, and level of awareness. In the
          here and now you can shape what happens after you die.<br /><br />By
          bringing the afterlife into the present moment,
          <i>Life After Death</i> opens up an immense new area of creativity.
          Ultimately there is no division between life and death—there is only
          one continuous creative project. Chopra invites us to become
          cocreators in this subtle realm, and as we come to understand the one
          reality, we shed our irrational fears and step into a numinous sense
          of wonder and personal power.

          “A must read for everyone who will die.” —Candace B. Pert, Ph.D.,
          author of <i>Molecules of Emotion</i><br /><br />“A penetrating and
          insightful investigation into the greatest mystery of existence. This
          is an important book because only by facing death will we come to a
          deeper realization of who we are.” —Eckhart Tolle, author of
          <i>The Power of Now</i><br /><br />“If I had any doubts about the
          afterlife, I don’t have them anymore. Deepak Chopra has cast his
          inimitable light on the darkened corners of death. I think this is his
          greatest contribution yet.” —Marianne Williamson, author of
          <i>The Gift of Change<br /></i><br />“Deepak Chopra . . . takes us to
          the edge of our own deepest inner truth about life after death by
          sharing with us his vision and his wisdom, which, as always, is
          breathtaking, healing, and soul-opening.” —Neale Donald Walsch, author
          of <i>Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends</i><br /><br />“Deepak
          Chopra has written a masterpiece that is long overdue in our spiritual
          culture. <i>Life After Death: The Burden of Proof</i> is a bold and
          comforting guide into the afterlife.” —Caroline Myss, author of
          <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i> and <i>Sacred Contracts</i
          ><br /><br />“By marrying science and wisdom in
          <i>Life After Death</i>, Chopra builds his case for an afterlife in
          which our most essential self, the seer that observes our experiences
          in this temporary home that we call the self, uses the end of this
          lifetime to pass over into the next. This is an intellectual and
          spiritual tour de force.” —Professor Robert Thurman, Columbia
          University, author of <i>Infinite Life</i> and
          <i>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</i>
