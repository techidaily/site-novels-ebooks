            What began as a practice in automatic writing quickly turned into
            something bigger - much bigger - than the few sentences I was
            expecting to write. An entity named Ramadear started channeling the
            most amazing messages through me. I asked if he was a new guide for
            me and he quickly responded that no, he was not a guide of mine but
            instead was a guide of our planet. I was to ask questions and
            Ramadear would answer in way that I, and the modern human, could
            understand.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Ramadear is part of a collective which is a group of spirit beings.
            He told me that he would be the voice of the collective, but the
            information would be coming from many of the members. They channel
            messages based on the Law of One, which is understanding why we are
            here on planet earth; how and why we want our souls to evolve and
            how to be of service to others rather than in service to
            self.&nbsp;These were all very esoteric, but I was guaranteed that
            Ramadear and the collective would present the information and answer
            my very human questions in a way the modern human was willing and
            ready to understand.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Anybody who knows me, understands that I can be a bit snarky and
            jaded when information is presented to me that I might not
            understand. Evidently Ramadear is very aware of this too, for he and
            the collective were very patient with my attitude but did not
            hesitate to call me out but in a very loving way. I think that is
            true for most of us having the human experience; we can be defensive
            and snarky until things become clear. That is the intent of this
            book - to clarify, inform, inspire, and educate how we as a human
            race can heal ourselves and our planet.&nbsp;
