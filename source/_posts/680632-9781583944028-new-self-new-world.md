            >In the tradition of <i>Quantum Healing</i> and
            <i>Guns, Germs and Steel,</i> Philip Shepherd's
            <i>New Self, New World</i> makes an intellectual inquiry into how we
            might restore freedom, creativity, and a sense of presence in the
            moment by rejecting several fundamental myths about being human<br /></b
          ><br />
          <i>New Self, New World</i> challenges the primary story of what it
          means to be human, the random and materialistic lifestyle that author
          Philip Shepherd calls our “shattered reality.” This reality encourages
          us to live in our heads, self-absorbed in our own anxieties. Drawing
          on diverse sources and inspiration, <i>New Self, New World</i> reveals
          that our state of head-consciousness falsely teaches us to see the
          body as something we possess and to try to take care of it without
          ever really learning how to inhabit it. Shepherd articulates his
          vision of a world in which each of us enjoys a direct, unmediated
          experience of being alive. He petitions against the futile pursuit of
          the “known self” and instead reveals the simple grace of just being
          present.<br /><br />
          In compelling prose, Shepherd asks us to surrender to the reality of
          “what is” that enables us to reunite with our own being. Each chapter
          is accompanied by exercises meant to bring Shepherd’s vision into
          daily life, what the author calls a practice that “facilitates the
          voluntary sabotage of long-standing patterns.”
          <i>New Self, New World</i> is at once a philosophical primer, a
          spiritual handbook, and a roaming inquiry into human history.

        <p>
          “An exceptionally important book.”<br />—Andrew Harvey, scholar,
          mystic, author of <i>Son of Man, The Return of the Mother</i>, and
          <i>The Way of Passion</i><br /><br />“<i>New Self, New World</i> is an
          extraordinary work—an awesome display of wisdom distilled from the
          world’s great wisdom traditions and the majestic individuals who have
          experienced them. This book is about achieving the highest dimensions
          of which humans are capable. Highly recommended.”<br />—Larry Dossey,
          MD, author of
          <i>Healing Beyond the Body, Reinventing Medicine,</i> and
          <i>Healing Words</i><br /><br />“Shepherd has written a masterpiece.
          <i>New Self, New World</i> calls us back to source, artfully reminding
          us of the divine magnificence that we have long forgotten in our
          disembodied culture. As I read it, I felt my shoulders drop as my
          heart became more available to the moment. Read this book, and
          remember your self.”<br />—Jeff Brown, author of <i>Soulshaping</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>New Self, New World</i> is an exciting investigation
          of the human psyche, which is commonly male-oriented, and the
          deep-seated problems that result when deprived of its female
          counterpart. Using conventional spiritual concepts, such as the Holy
          Trinity, Shepherd provides a workable guide to achieving inner
          fulfillment by accepting the so-called ‘weak’ elements of our dual
          nature.”<br />
          —<i>Foreword Reviews</i><br /><br />“At its core, this book is a
          cultural discourse about reconnecting to the wholeness of being human:
          to integrate the innate intelligence of the body into a functioning
          paradigm of human experience and evolution. The idea that we ‘live in
          our heads’ and are mostly disconnected from our body is not new. What
          is new is how this author extensively examines the historical,
          philosophical, scientific, mythological, spiritual, and social paths
          that have embedded this dissociative worldview as reality, to the
          extent that we are completely unaware that we are merely actors on a
          ‘headstrong’ stage of our own making… not since Ken Wilber introduced
          the Western world to the integral movement of East-West
          psycho-spirituality, has there been a catalyst for a paradigm shift
          that is so relevant and radically reinventive.”<br />
          —<i>New Consciousness Review</i><br /><br />“This ambitious and
          wide-ranging book grew out of workshops [Philip Shepherd] has led for
          more than two decades… Shepherd believes that the culture that
          influences our ideas and experiences tells us the big lie day by day:
          ‘the roots of the self do not lie in the world around us, nor even in
          the body, but are preserved intact within the blood-brain barrier.’
          This fiction of self-achieved independence comes at us from all
          directions when everything in science and spirituality enables us to
          embrace the universe as an interdependent reality.”<br />
          —<i>Spirituality &amp; Practice</i><br /><br />
          “Philip Shepherd has written a book which lays the foundation that
          could lead us humans to a much higher dimension than we now exhibit in
          <i
            >New Self, New World: Recovering Our Senses in the Twenty-First
            Century</i
          >. The book constantly harps against the very things that stand in our
          way of achieving this heightened state: the self-centeredness that
          seems to dominate our mind and materialism that seems to become more
          acute with each passing day… The book provides exercises for the body,
          mind and being that will help begin the process of reaching the
          potential which we are capable of attaining.”<br />
          —MyShelf.com<br /><br />“Shepherd demonstrates how we come into our
          true humanity only when we unite with our core-the deep, innate
          intelligence of the body. Our consciousness is not centered in the
          head any more than the universe is centered around the earth… At once
          a spiritual handbook, a philosophical primer and a roaming inquiry
          into human history, <i>New Self, New World </i>cracks open the
          possibilities of human experience and, with clarity, inspiration and
          compassion, lays the groundwork for personal renewal.”<br />
          —<i>Autumn Blues Reviews</i><br /><br />“Philip Shepherd presents a
          fascinating examination of myth, consciousness, logic, and existence
          as our society grows increasingly more fearful and anxious. For anyone
          wanting a new perspective on achieving wholeness or a new sense of
          living a more present life, <i>New Self, New World</i> is a book worth
          reading. … exceptionally well-written and insightful.”<br />
          —CirclesOfLight.com<br /><br />“Changing with the world is key to
          making sure it doesn't change you.
          <i
            >New Self, New World: Recovering Our Senses in the Twenty-First
            Century</i
          >
          is a new age spirituality book from Philip Shepherd that offers wisdom
          on how to better face the world, shifting ourselves and controlling
          ourselves as the world turns. With much philosophy, Philip Shepherd
          offers much to ponder about our changing world and what it means to be
          human. <i>New Self, New World</i> is an ideal read for spirituality
          and self-help collections.”<br />
