          <i>Doctor's Choice</i> helps overwhelmed doctors discover the crucial
          steps they need to take to get clarity and find balance. Often,
          doctors’ relationships and health suffer due to excessive work-related
          stress and demands—sometimes even driving them to quit their practice.
          Is it even possible to be a doctor and also live a happy, stress-free
          life? Dr. Maritta Philp had been working as a doctor for over 20 years
          before the intensity and stress of modern medical practice inspired
          her to take a long, hard look at where the road she was on would lead.
          She realized the final destination for her would be one of burn-out
          and resentment, causing her to make different choices for her life and
          career. Maritta is passionate about enabling people to create a life
          they can be in love with, a life that reflects their most important
          ideas and values. <i>Doctor's Choice</i> explores in a no-nonsense
          manner the issues affecting today's doctors in a world of
          ever-increasing patient demand. Balancing the need to look after
          patients and themselves is a challenge which doctors need to meet for
          the benefit of all.

        <p>
          Dr. Maritta Philp, MD, had worked as a doctor for over 20 years before
          the intensity and stress of modern medical practice inspired her to
          take a long, hard look at where the road she was on would lead. She
          now works as a successful coach and therapist, helping people to
          identify and overcome their own obstacles and enabling them to step
          into a self-directed and empowered life. Dr. Philp also runs workshops
          and speaks on related topics. Born in Germany, Maritta moved to the UK
          in 1996 to complete her specialist training. She moved to Scotland
          soon after, where she still lives with her husband, two beautiful
          daughters, and her dog Maisie. www.marittaphilp.com
