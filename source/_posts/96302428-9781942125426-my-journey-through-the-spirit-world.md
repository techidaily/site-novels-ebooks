          What happens when we die? What is the afterworld like? Do heaven and
          hell really exist? These are some of the questions that we often ask,
          but can’t find clear answers to. In this book, Ryuho Okawa shares his
          personal account of visiting the other world and interacting with the
          souls that reside there. For Okawa, who visits the spirit world on a
          regular basis, visiting the spirit world is everyday experience as
          common as “going into a back yard.”<br />In this book, he shares
          surprising facts such as that we visit the spirit world during sleep,
          that souls in the spirit world go to a school to learn about how to
          use their spiritual power, and that people continue to live in the
          same lifestyle as they did in this world. By sharing true and detailed
          accounts of his experiences, Okawa shows how the other world can be as
          real as our life in this world. This unique and authentic guide to the
          spirit world will awaken us to the truth of life and death, and show
          us how we should start living so that we can return to a bright world
          of heaven.

        </h4>
        <p>
          RYUHO OKAWA is recognized internationally as a global visionary,
          thinker, best-selling author, as well as spiritual leader with a
          simple goal: to help people find true happiness and create a better
          world. Okawa's books have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide
          and have been translated into 29 languages. His books share his
          principles for happiness, as well as insights and practiced methods
          for increasing our capacity for love and promoting our spiritual
          growth.<br />In 1986, Okawa founded Happy science as a spiritual
          movement dedicated to bringing greater happiness to humankind by
          uniting religions and cultures to live in harmony. Happy Science has
          grown rapidly from its beginnings in Japan to a worldwide
          organization. The spiritual workshops Happy Science offers are open to
          people of all faiths and walks of life and are rooted in the same
          principles of happiness that inspired Okawa’s own spiritual awakening.
          Okawa is compassionately committed to the spiritual growth of others;
          in addition to writing and publishing books, he continues to give
          talks around the world.
