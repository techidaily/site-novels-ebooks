            >Previously unpublished - This is a collection of Krishnamurti's
            speeches and informal talks where he discusses war, politics and
            global tensions. It's especially vital in these times where people
            are overwhelmed by bad news and discord on all sides.</b
          ><br /><br />On its 40th anniversary, Krishnamurti was invited to
          speak to the United Nations. He was then 90 years old, and they used
          the opportunity to give him a peace medal. The editors at the
          Krishnamurti Foundation of America were then requested to add more
          content from various recorded talks to create a book to be distributed
          by the World Future Society. The book was given out for free at their
          convention in Washington DC in 1992 but other than that it has never
          been published. The location of the talks transcribed ranges from
          Brussels to Mumbai, and from San Diego to Colombo.<br /><br />We are
          accustomed to Krishnamurti giving guidance on meditation, on inner
          states and qualities of the mind, but not so much on the world, on how
          we might live and on how to act in a world torn by conflict and by
          perceived decline and degradation. What can we do? How should we act?
          These extracts from talks, speeches and other books will help us feel
          better when we feel overwhelmed and encourage us to do what is within
          our power to make things better. Audiences are desperate for some
          constructive good news in these confusing and troubling times; there
          are no simple answers and Krishnamurti would never offer these anyway,
          but this is like sitting round the fire with a trusted elder.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Jiddu Krishnamurti lived from 1895 to 1986, and is regarded as one of
          the greatest philosophical and spiritual figures of the twentieth
          century. He claimed no allegiance to any caste, nationality or
          religion and was bound by no tradition. For nearly sixty years he
          travelled the world and spoke spontaneously to large audiences until
          the end of his life in 1986 at the age of ninety.
