          Moving Beyond The Christian Myth takes the next step beyond Sloat’s
          first book on spirituality, A Handbook For Heretics. He explores the
          roots of the Christian faith, tracing them back to their pagan origins
          in ancient religions. Then, one by one, he analyzes the essential
          beliefs of Christianity, showing how they cannot literally be true.
          The various chapters contend that: Christianity is a religious myth,
          We don’t need a savior, The Bible is not the Word of God, Jesus is not
          God, The church is more political than spiritual. The remainder of the
          book is filled with stories of mystical experiences which demonstrate
          how the spirit world is an integral part of our daily lives. These
          topics include: Out-of-Body Experiences, Visions, Past Life Recalls,
          After Death Communication, Angel Communication, Pre-Birth Experiences
          and Coincidence. Sloat argues that these stories reveal spiritual
          truths which are not part of the traditional teachings of religion. He
          asks the church to admit that its story is based on myth rather than
          literal truth, he urges the church to incorporate these experiences
          into its belief system, and he concludes by presenting a vision of a
          future in which people can worship God as the creator, not of a
          religion based on the fear of hell, but of a spiritual kingdom founded
          on love, light and hope. This book will be an inspiration to all those
          who are seeking something beyond the mythological teaching of the
          past. About the Author: John W. Sloat, a former Presbyterian minister,
          served churches in Pennsylvania and Ohio for over 40 years. He holds a
          B.A. from Denison University, 1954; an M.Div. from Princeton Seminary,
          1957; and a Th.M. from Pittsburgh Seminary, 1977. Previous books
          include Lord, Make Us One (non-fiction, 1986); The Other Half
          (fiction, 2001); Memories of My Misadventures (fiction, 2008); and A
          Handbook For Heretics (non-fiction, second edition, 2009). Several of
          his sermons have been included in Pulpit Digest, a national preaching
          journal. He has been married to Helen Burdick Sloat, a psychiatric
          nurse, for 56 years, and they have three children, eight
          grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. A pianist and organist,
          Sloat also plays the French horn, is a scratch model builder, and
          leads spirituality groups.
