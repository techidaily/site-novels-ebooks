            rapidly, inspiring you each day as you move forward on your personal
            path.<br />&nbsp;

          purpose and major connection to the Divine, serving others in
          meaningful ways, and making a real difference in this world
          spiritually.Yes, you can also grow as a HUMAN BEING, someone who just
          wants to be happy, effective, enjoying relationships, finding meaning
          in everyday life.
          <p>
            &nbsp;<br />This book helps you to grow both ways, one day at a
            time; 365 chapters, and most of them only one page long.<br />&nbsp;<br />You'll
            find flexible techniques and powerful spiritual understandings that
            work now, in the Aquarian Age.<br />&nbsp;<br />WHAT WILL YOU FIND
            IN YOUR PAGE FOR TODAY?<br />&nbsp;<br />Some days, you will find
            fresh ideas to ENHANCE what you do already for personal growth, like
            prayer and affirmations.<br />&nbsp;<br />Other days, innovative
            techniques will WAKE YOU UP in ways that are entirely new.<br />&nbsp;<br />INTEGRATING
            spiritual growth into your human life is another way that you can
            make fresh discoveries while partnering with this self-help book.
          </p>
          Imagine not just talking your talkOr walking your talkBut also
          bringing great love, light, and power to all of your talk!
          <p>
            Imagine further, what if you aim to move forward on your path to
            ENLIGHTENMENT? Then you may be impressed with how much this book
            helps.<br />&nbsp;<br />A teacher of personal development since
            1970, in 2012 Rose Rosetree moved into the role of Enlightenment
            Coach. (You can read related articles and success stories at her
            blog, "Deeper Perception Made Practical." Including a list of people
            Rose has helped to move into the higher state of consciousness known
            throughout the ages as "Enlightenment.")<br />&nbsp;<br />HOW THE
            BOOK'S STRUCTURE HELPS YOU TO IMPROVISE<br />&nbsp;<br />Chapters
            are grouped around life themes, such as "Attracting Love," "Family
            of Choice," and "Beautiful, Healthy Body."<br />&nbsp;<br />For
            eight days in a row, you'll find inspiration on that particular
            theme. Then this exploration completes with Day 9, a poem to start
            you thinking... and maybe unleash your inner poet or song-maker or
            dancer.<br />&nbsp;
          </p>
          Go through this book in order to enjoy this structure.Or flip to a
          page at random.Or choose your favorite life theme. You can find this
          at the "Table of Techniques" available here at the online bookstore
          under the product description "From the Inside Flap." (This same
          listing is also at the official Rose Rosetree website, on the detail
          page for this book.)
          <p>
            &nbsp;<br />However you play with this resource, you can look
            forward to a whole year of fresh discoveries. Don't expect any two
            days to be alike. What will remain constant is Rose Rosetree's
            respect for you as a conscious co-creator with the Divine. That
            includes respect for your creativity, courage and wisdom, all the
            unique gifts of your soul.<br />&nbsp;<br />This book can help you
            to find new joy every day. Strengthening yourself, both as a World
            Server and a healthy human being, you will&nbsp; encounter many
            flavors of joy. And becoming more and more self-actualized every
            day, you just might cross the threshold into Enlightenment.<br />&nbsp;<br />Because
            all human beings on earth now are living in the Age of Awakening, a
            time when millions of ordinary people are able to gain
            Enlightenment, and do it as householders rather than renunciates.
            "Householders," of course, are people like you and me, who balance
            our human lives with being a World Server.

          meditations that is inspirational and so very, very real in the sense
          of inviting each person into the creativity and joy that each
          experience can be....Whatever your penchant is, it's guaranteed that
          these meditations will touch some aspect of your being!And just in
          case that is only minimally experienced (highly doubtful!), there are
          poems and meditations that one can read which will elicit some
          definite blessing to follow. --Viviane Crystal, Crystal Reviews
