          Firsthand testimonies by 20 leaders in culture and science of their
          interactions with the Akashic field <br />
          <br />• Provides important evidence for the authenticity of
          nonmaterial contact that human beings have with each other and with
          the cosmos <br />
          <br />• Demonstrates that the increasing frequency and intensity of
          these experiences is evidence of a widespread spiritual resurgence
          <br />
          <br />• Includes contributions by Alex Grey, Stanislav Grof, Stanley
          Krippner, Swami Kriyananda, Edgar Mitchell, and others <br />
          <br />Knowing or feeling that we are all connected to each other and
          to the cosmos by more than our eyes and ears is not a new notion but
          one as old as humanity. Traditional indigenous societies were fully
          aware of nonmaterial connections and incorporated them into their
          daily life. The modern world, however, continues to dismiss and even
          deny these intangible links--taking as real only that which is
          physically manifest or proved “scientifically.” Consequently our
          mainstream culture is spiritually impoverished, and the world we live
          in has become disenchanted. <br />
          <br />In <i>The Akashic Experience</i>, 20 leading authorities in
          fields such as psychiatry, physics, philosophy, anthropology, natural
          healing, near death experience, and spirituality offer firsthand
          accounts of interactions with a cosmic memory field that can transmit
          information to people without having to go through the senses. Their
          experiences with the Akashic field are now validated and supported by
          evidence from cutting-edge sciences that shows that there is a cosmic
          memory field that contains all information--past, present, and future.
          The increasing frequency and intensity of these Akashic experiences
          are an integral part of a large-scale spiritual resurgence and
          evolution of human consciousness that is under way today.

          "The 20 accounts make fascinating reading, testifying to the fact that
          we are subtly yet effectively linked with each other, with nature, and
          with the cosmos. It inspires solidarity, love, empathy, and a sense of
          responsibility for each other and the environment. These are
          ineluctable elements of the mind-set we need to pull out of the global
          crisis that threatens our world and to create peace and sustainability
          on this perilously ravaged planet."
