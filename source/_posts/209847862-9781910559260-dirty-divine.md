          Dirty &amp; Divine takes us on an adventure through the magical world
          of tarot cards. Divination comes from the Latin verb ‘divinare’ and
          literally means ‘being inspired by a god’. You could say that tarot is
          one means of putting images and words to the voices of Divine beings
          that offer a higher perspective on human life on Earth! As always
          Grist is brave, funny and very honest! You are in very good hands on
          this journey into mystery and will discover the down-to-earth everyday
          benefits of tarot cards.

          For anyone investing time, energy and passion in the journey through
          the tarot this is a wonderful book with a no nonsense and well
          grounded attitude. I love the way Alice has so eloquently woven the
          tapestry of her life into the tarot to assist the reader in
          understanding how life situations blend with each of the tarot cards.
          For the beginner, this is a wonderful way of retaining the information
          relating to the card meanings, making it easy for them to revert back
          to the life situation for reference and understanding. The book is
          split into manageable, easy to understand sections from the intuitive
          sense of the card to Alice’s own journey, harnessing their power and
          finally the Dirty &amp; Divine Spell-words to reinforce their meaning.
          I love this book because it has such a different and refreshing
          approach to learning the tarot.

          Dirty &amp; Divine asks you to leave everything you know about tarot
          at the door, kick off your heels and pour yourself a cocktail. Forget
          fortune telling and learning key words, this is a real and raw look
          into the tarot, how it works and how it can help us understand modern
          life. Alice shares her own story with honesty, looking at both the
          shadow (‘dirty’) and light (‘divine’) sides of herself and encourages
          us to do the same for real transformation and even more importantly,
          understanding of the self. Reading Dirty &amp; Divine was like a night
          in with your incredibly clever and cool best mate, getting deep and
          meaningful over a deck of cards and reclaiming the Goddess within,
          both sides of her, dirty and divine.

          Alice has been my go-to woman for tarot readings for years now,
          because her truth, knowledge + wisdom are the REAL DEAL. In reading
          this book, and what Alice shares within the dirty + divine pages of
          it, you will have direct access to all that she knows (FYI: that's a
          lot), but what I find REALLY juicy about it, is that you'll experience
          how to use the cards + the stories, metaphors, signs + symbols they
          hold as a tool to help you remember your power. The fierce self-love,
          the courageous + wild truth of who you were before you forgot. Let
          Alice, the high priestess of the tarot, take you on a journey of
          remembrance + reverence. The dirty + the divine.

          Dirty &amp; Divine provides a wonderful opportunity for tarot lovers
          and spiritual souls. Real, raw, relatable and incredibly warm. You
          feel as though you have a personal mentor and friend guiding you
          through the magic and mystery of the tarot. Alice gives fresh insight
          to a loved esoteric system along with real life reflections through
          her personal journey in her life. The addition of ways you can work
          with each of the cards brings a grounded understanding to the reader.
          Dirty &amp; Divine is a book that will be read more than once and have
          a well-loved place in my sacred library.
