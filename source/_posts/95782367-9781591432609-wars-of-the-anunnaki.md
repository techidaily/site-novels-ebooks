          Examines the Anunnaki gods’ evolving relationships with humanity,
          their power struggles, and the details of their nuclear war on
          Earth<br /><br />• Analyzes the crisis and rationale behind the
          Anunnaki decision to nuke 5 cities in the Jordan plain, resulting in
          the obliteration of Sumerian civilization <br /><br />• Draws upon the
          work of Zecharia Sitchin, the Book of Genesis, Sumerian clay tablets,
          and archaeological evidence such as ancient radioactive skeletons
          <br /><br />• Examines the Anunnakis’ lack of higher consciousness,
          their reliance on technology, their sacred power objects and sacred
          geometry, and the possibility of Anunnaki bases on Mars in the distant
          past<br /><br />The detonation of nuclear weapons in the 20th century
          was not the first time humanity has seen such terrible destruction.
          Drawing upon the work of Zecharia Sitchin, the Book of Genesis,
          Sumerian clay tablets, and archaeological evidence such as ancient
          radioactive skeletons, Chris Hardy reveals the ancient nuclear event
          that destroyed the Sumerian civilization and the power struggles of
          the “gods” that led up to it.<br /><br />The author explains how the
          Anunnaki came to Earth from the planet Nibiru seeking gold to repair
          their ozone layer. Using genetic engineering, they created modern
          humanity to do their mining work and installed themselves as our kings
          and our gods. Anunnaki god Enki had a fatherly relationship with the
          first two humans. Then Enlil, Enki’s brother, took over as Commander
          of Earth, instating a sole-god theocracy and a war against the clan of
          Enki and humanity for spoiling the Anunnaki bloodlines through
          interbreeding. This shift imposed a blackout not only of the very
          human nature of the Anunnaki “gods” but also of humanity’s own ancient
          past on Earth.<br /><br />Two of Enlil’s attacks against the Enki clan
          and humanity are described in the stories of the Deluge and the Tower
          of Babel. His final attempt, after coercing the Assembly of the Gods
          into voting yes, was the nuclear bombing of 5 cities of the Jordan
          plain, including Sodom and Gomorrah, which resulted in the destruction
          of the Sumerian civilization and the Anunnakis’ own civilization on
          Earth, including their space port in the Sinai. The author reveals
          how, after each attempt, humanity was saved by Enki, chief scientist
          Ninmah, and Enki’s son Hermes.<br /><br />The author explores how the
          Anunnakis’ reliance on technology and their recurrent wars caused them
          to lose touch with cosmic consciousness. And she reveals how we will
          be doomed to repeat this dynamic until humanity awakens to our true
          origins.
