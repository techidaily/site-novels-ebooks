            "It's rare that a medically trained scientist dares to venture into
            the mystical world of our cells and biology, but Dr. Barrett has
            both the courage and insights to do just that. By combining her
            scientifically trained mind with the wisdom of her heart, she takes
            us on an adventure of perceiving the inner workings of our bodies in
            a new way. This book will serve anyone curious about how our
            physical lives are related to this vast universe that we
            occupy."—Leigh Fortson, author of Embrace, Release, Heal: An
            Empowering Guide to Talking About, Thinking About, and Treating
            Cancer<br />"In Secrets of Your Cells, biochemist Sondra Barrett
            puts us in touch with the incredible beauty and organization of the
            cells of the human body as she translates the small-scale life of
            cells into large-scale lessons for living. This is the work of
            someone with a genuine reverence for the sacredness of life." —Larry
            Dossey, MD, author of Healing Words, Reinventing Medicine, and The
            Power of Premonitions<br />"Sondra has the gift of a scientist's
            mind wedded to an artist's heart."—Eli Jaxon-Bear, author of From
            Fixation to Freedom: The Enneagram of Liberation.<br />A guiding
            principle of the spiritual journey is to look within. Biochemist
            Sondra Barrett has done just that—and discovered that our cells
            offer us invaluable wisdom for transformation, relationships, and
            healing. With Secrets of Your Cells, this scientist and mind-body
            teacher takes you on a provocative journey into our inner universe.
            Exploring the cell's astonishing architecture, intelligence, and
            ability to function harmoniously, this book offers practical
            exercises for applying the lessons of our cells to live well and
            thrive. Join Dr. Barrett to learn:<br />Practical guidance for
            engaging cellular intelligence in everyday life through our
            thoughts, choices, and actionsInner wisdom embedded in our cells
            about sanctuary, letting go, and being in the present momentWhat our
            cells can teach us about communication, cooperation, and purposeHow
            the anatomy of our cells responds to energy, movement, and internal
            tensionCells and molecules as sacred art, as revealed by Dr.
            Barrett's fascinating color photographs of the inner and outer
            world<br />"Our cells are more than just fortuitous arrangements of
            chemicals," explains Dr. Barrett. "They are a community of trillions
            of sentient entities cooperating to create a sanctuary for the human
            soul." Drawing on the insights from shamanic practices, energy
            medicine, and the wisdom of our body's fundamental building blocks,
            Secrets of Your Cells is a thoroughly researched and accessible
            resource for putting cutting-edge biology into action.
