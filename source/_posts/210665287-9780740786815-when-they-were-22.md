            Most of us can point to one or two moments in our lives when
            everything changed, when a stroke of fate forever altered the
            future, or a single decision sparked a lifetime of consequences.
            Across the broadest spectrum of famous people, that moment happens
            more often at 22 than any other age.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Brad Dunn's <i>When They Were 22</i> tells the stories of famous
            people and the fateful events and choices they faced at the
            all-important age of 22. From writers, actors, and musicians to
            politicians, hip-hop moguls, criminals, and porn stars,
            <i>When They Were 22</i> chronicles some of the most legendary,
            influential, and controversial celebrities during the most pivotal
            year of their lives. Just a few examples:
          </p>
          <p>
            * Oprah Winfrey dropped out of college to become a newsreader in
            Nashville, and at 22 moved to Baltimore to work at another station
            where she landed her own talk show.
          </p>
          <p>
            * Jack White had his own upholstery business at age 22, but while
            practicing the guitar he asked his wife, Meg, to try the drums--he
            liked her playing so much they began performing as a two-piece band,
            the White Stripes.
          </p>
          <p>
            * When Karl Rove was 22, he was accused of espionage and deceitful
            campaign tactics by the College Republicans and wound up meeting
            future president George W. Bush.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an eclectic lineup that includes Bill Murray, Sean "Diddy"
            Combs, Marilyn Monroe, Stephen Hawking, Pamela Anderson, Malcolm X,
            Stanley Kubrick, Andy Warhol, Larry Flynt, Jane Goodall, Harvey
            Weinstein, and many more, <i>When They Were 22</i> is perfect for
            graduates, job searchers, celebrity watchers, biography lovers, or
            anyone who doubts that in life anything is possible.
