            >DISCOVER HOW TO USE THE MOST POWERFUL LAW IN THE UNIVERSE – THE LAW
            OF ATTRACTION TO HAVE MORE MONEY AND BETTER HEALTH</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />This Leading Edge abundance work by Esther and
          Jerry Hicks evolved from the transcription of the original teachings
          of Abraham, the loving group consciousness from the non-physical
          dimension, explains that the two subjects most chronically affected by
          the powerful Law of Attraction are financial and physical
          well-being.<br />&nbsp;<br />This motivational book will shine a
          spotlight on each of the most significant aspects of your life
          experience and then guide you to the conscious creative control of
          every aspect of your life, and also goes right to the heart of what
          most of you are probably troubled by: money and physical health.<br />&nbsp;<br />Not
          having enough money or not having good health puts you in the perfect
          position for creating more of that which you do not have.<br />&nbsp;<br />This
          classic manifesting book has been written to deliberately align you
          with the most powerful law in the universe—the Law of Attraction—so
          that you can make it work specifically for you.<br />&nbsp;<br />Sections
          Include:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />- Processing of Pivoting and
          Positive Aspects<br />&nbsp;<br />- Attracting Money and Manifesting
          Abundance<br />&nbsp;<br />- Maintaining Your Physical Well-Being<br />&nbsp;<br />-
          Perspectives of Health, Weight, and Mind<br />&nbsp;<br />- Careers,
          as Profitable Sources of Pleasure<br />&nbsp;<br />Also included is a
          free CD (excerpted from a live Abraham-Hicks workshop) that features
          the Art of Allowing your physical and financial well-being to come
          through. In this consciousness-shifting book, you’ll learn how to:<br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Create a new money story<br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Live in harmony with your desire<br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Be the joyful creator of your ultimate life experience<br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Feel better now<br />·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Focus on solutions<br />&nbsp;<br />Begin the day with good-feeling
          thoughts<br />“What is this book about? It teaches that life is
          supposed to feel good and that our overall Well-Being is what is
          natural. It teaches that no matter how good your life is now, it can
          always get better, and that the choice and the power to improve your
          life experience is within your personal control.<br />&nbsp;<br />And
          it offers practical philosophical tools that—when put into consistent
          use— will enable you to allow yourself to experience more of the
          wealth, health, and happiness that is your natural birthright.<br />&nbsp;<br />And
          so, it is with extraordinary joy that we can tell you—from our own
          personal experience: This works!”<br />&nbsp;<br />– Jerry Hicks<br />&nbsp;<br />Like
          Abraham says, nothing is more important than feeling good!&nbsp; You
          just need to want it and allow it. This book will help you start
          telling your story in a new way, just as you want it to be!

        </h4>
        <p>
          Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from
          the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began
          disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close
          business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being
          received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical
          questions and then applying Abraham’s answers to their own situations,
          Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of
          Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of
          how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference
          center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately
          50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction
          workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding
          stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has
          been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers
          and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham’s Law of
          Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures,
          and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person
          to person—as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of
          spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November
          2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther
          continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her
          physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical
          help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly
          by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online
          live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube
          library of Abraham videos. Abraham—a group of uplifting Non-Physical
          teachers—present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And
          as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of
          loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in
          print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our
          loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total
          Self. Abraham-Hicks Publications may be contacted through the
