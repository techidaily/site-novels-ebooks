            >From the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling author of
            <i>Sacred Contracts</i> and <i>Anatomy of the Spirit</i>, a timely
            guide with 100 prayers for entering into a personal relationship
            with the Divine.<br /><br />***</b
          ><br /><br />In her most personal book to date, beloved teacher and
          best-selling author Caroline Myss draws on her own practice to help us
          regain our fluency in the language of prayer and renew our connection
          to the sacred.<br /><br /><i
            >Intimate Conversations with the Divine</i
          >
          offers 100 of Myss's personal prayers as a resource and inspiration to
          start a prayer practice of your own. Each prayer illustrates a
          different type of grace that feeds the human soul, from awakening,
          endurance, and healing, to silence, surrender, and trust.
          <br /><br />"We are one holy system of life and great cosmic truth,
          which is that all life-including all of us-breathes together," Myss
          writes. "I hope this book, these prayers, will bring you comfort and
          grace, and help you through the difficult times ahead. And I hope they
          will inspire you to believe that with God, all things are possible."

          "I've loved so many of Caroline Myss's books, but maybe none so much
          as <i>Intimate Conversations with the Divine</i>. Has there ever been
          a more urgent need for her unique and profound (and sometimes
          wonderfully cranky) take on our spiritual reality, healing, and the
          language of holiness? . . . Her words raise my spirit."<br />
          - <b>Anne Lamott</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of
          <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i> and <i>Help, Thanks, Wow</i>
          <br /><br />&nbsp;"<i>Intimate Conversations with the Divine</i> shows
          us that prayer isn't some esoteric activity reserved for a holy few;
          it's a language we are born knowing. These pages will encourage anyone
          who has lost the habit of daily prayer to take it up again, and
          inspire anyone who has never prayed to start the conversation now."<br />
          -<b> Maria Shriver</b>, best-selling author and award-winning
          journalist <br /><br />"Caroline Myss has written a book that sets the
          power of Prayer free from the monastery, allowing it to enter our
          hearts and minds as an essential Grace for these challenging modern
          times. In re-envisioning how we dialogue with the Divine, Caroline's
          profound, clear spiritual direction offers new direct access to
          Prayer's healing power and enduring capacity to help us up any
          mountain that we've been called to climb. New soulful summits of your
          life's potential await you through
          <i>Intimate Conversations with the Divine</i>."<br />
          - <b>Robert Ohotto</b>, intuitive strategist and best-selling author
          of <i>Transforming Fate into Destiny</i> <br /><br />"These heartfelt
          conversations with the divine offer a profound invitation to express
          our own spiritual questions and concerns, yearnings, and deepest
          dreams. With the warmth and wisdom of a good friend, Caroline Myss has
          given us a treasure trove of spiritual insight for these troubled
          times."<br />
          - <b>Clark Strand and Perdita Finn</b>, co-authors of<i>

            in the Rosary</i
          >
          <br /><br />"What is the prayer you most need to pray in your life? Do
          you know how it begins? In I<i
            >ntimate Conversations with the Divine</i
          >, Caroline Myss teaches you a whole new way to pray. Praying with
          God, not to God. Filled with 100 beautiful prayers-holy moments of
          divine intimacy-this mystical handbook helps you cultivate a practice
          of daily deep prayer that invites a whole new level of guidance,
          grace, and inspiration into your life."<br />

          >
          <br /><br />"In this book Caroline Myss invites us to listen in as she
          prays to the Lord her God. As we listen, we realize she is encouraging
          us to speak to the Lord Our God of all the expected and unexpected
          things our heart wants us to say. And, as our own voice falls silent,
          to then listen to the still small voice of God that is always there
          guiding and sustaining us in each passing moment of our lives."<br />
          - <b>James Finley</b>, Contemplative Teacher with the Center for
          Action and Contemplation <br /><br />"Once again, Caroline Myss lights
          the way, showing us how the epidemics of this time must ultimately be
          addressed at the level of the soul. . . . This is prayer with power
          and energy-the power to breathe and instill life; the energy of
          unconditional love that opens us up so that we once again feel that
          which most nourishes and ultimately heals."<br />
          - <b>Jeffrey Rediger, M.D., M.Div</b>., Harvard Medical School, author
          of <i>Cured: The New Science of Spontaneous Healing</i>
          <br /><br />"In <i>A Course in Miracles</i> it's written that 'prayer
          is the medium of miracles.' At no time in the world has it been more
          obvious that humanity is in need of power that we alone cannot bestow.
          Caroline Myss presents the most ancient of powers in a startlingly
          relevant way."<br />
          - <b>Marianne Williamson</b>, author <br /><br />"Caroline Myss
          beautifully succeeds in awakening the lost language of prayer, a holy
          language that our world needs as never before. Her prayers are flashes
          of her intimacies with the divine. . . . It is always brave to share
          the intimacy of the messages hidden in silence. When this courage is
          matched by true gentleness, the effect is powerful healing; her
          prayers will heal sick souls. Caroline's evident care for others and
          her spirit of service will make this book a true friend and companion
          for those in need at every step of their life's journey."<br />
          - <b>Laurence Freeman</b>, Benedictine monk and leader of the World
          Community for Christian Meditation <br /><br />"Every thought is a
          prayer. Thinking sets in motion spiritual forces to create change.
          <i>Intimate Conversations with the Divine</i> provides that essential
          thinking for the optimal mystical life."<br />
          - <b>C. Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D.</b>, president of Shealy-Sorin
          Wellness and Holos Energy Medicine Education <br /><br />"At a time
          when we need to reawaken our relationship with the Divine, along comes
          I<i>ntimate Conversations with the Divine</i>, which spoke deep inside
          the heart of my longings, visions, and truths. This book will awaken
          anyone who is asleep, and to those who are awakened, it will add more
          fuel to your 'awakeness.' The whole world needs to deepen their
          conversations with the Divine, and Caroline's new book will take you
          to a place to find all of your life's solutions. The best read I have
          come across in decades!"<br />
          - <b>Sister Dr. Jenna, </b>Brahma Kumaris, radio host,
          <i>America Meditating</i> <br /><br />"Sometimes I feel as if I go
          through the day barely able to see, unable to hear, saying things I
          don't really mean. A lost human being in a sea of other stressed-out,
          disconnected people. What to do? I'll tell you what to do: read this
          book! It clears a path through the dark woods of our times. Caroline
          Myss says that the true meaning of prayer is a request for help in how
          to see. Reading<i> Intimate Conversations with the Divine </i>gave me
          new sight, opened my ears, and helped me say beautiful, meaningful,
          powerful new prayers."<br />
          - <b>Elizabeth Lesser</b>, co-founder of Omega Institute, author of
          <i>Broken Open</i> and <i>Cassandra Speaks</i> <br /><br />"In this
          honest and unique spiritual diary, Caroline Myss invites us to a
          daring journey into the inner truth of our deepest selves. . . . Myss
          shares with us a deeply personal glimpse into her own mystical soul
          and-if we listen deeply-into our own. . . . In a time of religious
          deconstruction, Myss dares to reconstruct. She calls us to the deeper
          meaning and practice of prayer-one that will serve us well in these
          challenging times."<br />
          - <b>Matthew Fox</b>, author of
          <i
            >Prayer: A Radical Response to Life, The Tao of Thomas Aquinas, and
            Naming the Unnameable</i
          >
          <br /><br />"The power of prayer is resurfacing in our collective
          consciousness right at the moment we are all experiencing the
          shattering effects of the pandemic together. Right at the moment we
          are all in the same conversation about our vulnerabilities and
          concerns about the future, we are realizing that we need, once again,
          to pray. Caroline has shared a pathway of prayers back to the Divine.
          Only prayer can lead us now."<br />
          - <b>Jim Garrison, Ph.D.</b>, President of Ubiquity University
          <br /><br />"Open this book and be astonished. It is at once a
          revelation and a spirit-quaking reminder of the power and practice of
          prayer. It Is also the Passion Play of a mystic, Caroline Myss, as she
          daily enters into spirited conversation with the Divine, receiving
          insights that are as welcome as finding cool spring water in the
          desert. Soul deep and winsomely wise, Caroline brooks no whiny
          naysaying but persists in her talks until the laughter of God brings
          fresh insights, potent knowings into our human space and time. But be
          warned. You cannot commune with this book without being changed and
          charged. For you come to discover that you only live in the sacred
          cosmos but that it also lives in you. We are One Holy System. And then
          the great duet begins!"<br />
          - <b>Jean Houston, Ph.D.</b>, Chancellor of Meridian University,
          author of <i>The Wizard of Us</i> and
          <i>The Search for the Beloved</i> <br /><br />"Caroline is giving all
          of us exactly what we need to nourish our courage and embolden our
          embattled hope-a book on prayer that is not only a mystical classic
          but direct guidance as to how to align, nakedly and passionately, with
          the Divine from the most authentic part of ourselves. This book is far
          more than a masterpiece-it is a blazing manifesto of Truth and
          Empowerment which no sincere lover of God can afford not to read,
          learn from, and integrate profoundly."<br />
          - <b>Andrew Harvey</b>, author of
          <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i> and, with Carolyn Baker,
          <i>Savage Grace: How to Live Resiliently in the Global Dark Night</i>
          <br /><br />"I inhaled this book-a very personal and powerful prayer
          journey that is a gift to us all. The importance of holy language is
          critical, now more than ever. The perfect read for anyone who needs a
          boost of much-needed grace."<br />
          -<b>Jenniffer Weigel</b>, Emmy Award-winning journalist, author of
          <i>This Isn't the Life I Ordered</i> and
          <i>I'm Spiritual, Dammit!</i> <br /><br />"In this luminous collection
          of sacred conversations, Caroline Myss reclaims holy language and
          offers it back as blessing, as birthright, as a lighthouse beckoning
          us home from the storms of the human condition. Each prayer is
          drenched with potency, richly wrought, simultaneously particular and
          universal. What a gift to be invited to listen in on the intimate
          conversations between a master teacher and her God, and to find here
          the possibility of a direct response to our own innermost
          yearnings."<br />
          -<b> Mirabai Starr</b>, translator of Teresa of Avila and John of the
          Cross, author of <i>God of Love</i> and <i>Wild Mercy</i>
          <br /><br />"When Caroline Myss asked me to review her book
          <i>Intimate Conversations with the Divine</i>, I was unprepared for
          what I was in for. On the surface her book is about how prayer is the
          sacred language through which we intimately connect with something
          beyond and greater than ourselves. While reading her words, however, I
          was shocked-and delighted-when I began having the experience that
          something alive was speaking to me, as if I was in dialogue with
          another part of myself. But even more than that, in reading her book I
          began to intuitively feel through my heart that her words weren't
          about prayer, but were, in a very magical and unexpected way,
          answering a prayer of mine. It was as if a deeper part of myself had
          dreamed up Caroline's book to come my way at exactly the right moment
          in time in order to remind me how to deepen my communion with my own
          soul. I can't recommend Intimate Conversations with the Divine highly
          enough. Caroline has offered us a true gift that couldn't be more
          needed at this time in our history."<br />
          - <b>Paul Levy</b>, author of <i>Dispelling Wetiko</i> and
          <i>The Quantum Revelation</i><br /><br />"These prayers help us name
          our longings and give us permission to show up before God with new
          honesty and vulnerability. They encourage us to listen to those
          almost-silent whispers of God, who-like a gentle mother-is always
          eager to embrace us in our brokenness and bring us closer to Her
          heart." <br />
          - <b>Fr. Adam Bucko</b>, co-author of <i>Occupy Spirituality</i> and
