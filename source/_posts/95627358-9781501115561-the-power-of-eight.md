            >Discover how to tap into your extraordinary human capacity for
            connection and healing using astonishing new findings about the
            miraculous power of group intention in this new book by the author
            of the international bestsellers
            <i>The Intention Experiment </i>and<i> The Field. </i></b
          ><br /><br />In <i>The Power of Eight,</i> Lynne McTaggart—whose “work
          has had an unprecedented impact on the way everyday people think of
          themselves in the world” (Gregg Braden, author
          <i>of The Divine Matrix</i>)—reveals her remarkable findings from ten
          years of experimenting with small and large groups about how the power
          of group intention can heal our lives and change the world for the
          better.<br />
          <br />When individuals in a group focus their intention together on a
          single target, a powerful collective dynamic emerges that can heal
          longstanding conditions, mend fractured relationships, lower violence,
          and even rekindle life purpose. But the greatest untold truth of all
          is that group intention has a mirror effect, not only affecting the
          recipient but also reflecting back on the senders.<br />
          <br />Drawing on hundreds of case studies, the latest brain research,
          and dozens of McTaggart’s own university studies,
          <i>The Power of Eight</i> provides solid evidence showing that there
          is such a thing as a collective consciousness. Now you can learn to
          use it and unleash the power you hold inside of you to heal your own
          life, with help from this riveting, highly accessible book.

          <br />
          “Lynne&nbsp;McTaggart&nbsp;leads the way in guiding us to an
          enlightened perspective on the power of consciousness.”<br />
          <br />

          ><br />
          <br />
          “<i>The Power of Eight</i>&nbsp;is at once a revolution and an
          evolution in understanding, which opens us to both proof and practice
          of how the powers of a group intention can transmute and transform our
          pathos and our pain.”<br />
          <br />
          <b>—Jean Houston, PhD, chancellor, Meridian University&nbsp;</b><br />
          <br />
          “Lynne McTaggart has demonstrated something unique in the
          mind-body-spirit movement: You don’t need to be a Sufi master, take
          ayahuasca or spend years of disciplined spiritual practice to get a
          taste of the miraculous.&nbsp; All you need is a small group with a
          common intention.&nbsp; Read this book, form your own Power of Eight
          group and welcome the miracles in your own life.”<br />
          <br />

            of&nbsp;<i>Quantum Healing</i></b
          ><br />
          <br />
          “Throw away your self-help books.&nbsp; As Lynne McTaggart
          convincingly argues in this extraordinary book, it’s ‘other help’ that
          can truly transform you. As soon as you turn your thoughts from
          yourself to intending for someone else, you create rebound effects
          that heal your own life. Form a Power of Eight group and experience
          this miraculous circle for yourself.”<br />
          <br />

          <br />
          “Lynne McTaggart’s&nbsp;<i>The Power of Eight</i>&nbsp;is a gift to
          humanity, a book that truly will change your life – and in the most
          extraordinary and unexpected ways.&nbsp; This is the real secret –
          your life transforms when you heal for others in a group.&nbsp; It’s
          at the heart of most of the world’s religions – but McTaggart brings
          it to life, and verifies it with science. Read this book, for your own
          sake and for your family and friends (and, yes, even for complete
          strangers).”<br />

          <br />
          “Required reading for anyone who’d like proof of the power of prayer
          and group intention for it was written by the ultimate Doubting
          Thomas. Lynne McTaggart offers a page-turning account of her own
          struggles to understand the numerous extraordinary healing effects she
          witnesses in small and large intention groups.&nbsp; Every church
          group, every book group and every business team need a Power of Eight
          group to create a vortex of healing and transformation.”<br />

          ><br />
          <br />
          “Every one of us has the power to use our thoughts to heal our
          world.&nbsp; Lynne McTaggart doesn’t just describe this truth, she
          proves it again and again in scientifically-controlled studies, in
          large web-based experiments, in the compelling stories of people who
          have been transformed by her Power of Eight groups. It’s something you
          can do right now, and it will utterly change your life. And it’s so
          simple! Utterly revolutionary.”<br />

          <br />
          “This book is a beautifully written blueprint to awaken us to the

          transformation and peace both in our lives, and in our world. If you
          only buy one book this season make it this one, for this is one of the
