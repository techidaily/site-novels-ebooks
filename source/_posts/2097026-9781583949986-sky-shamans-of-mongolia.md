          Part travelogue, part experiential spiritual memoir, Kevin Turner
          takes us to visit with authentic shamans in the steppes and urban
          centers of modern-day Mongolia. Along the way, the author, a
          practicing shaman himself, tells of spontaneous medical diagnoses,
          all-night shamanic ceremonies, and miraculous healings, all welling
          from a rich culture in which divination, soul-retrieval, and spirit
          depossession are a part of everyday life.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Shamanism, described in the 1950s by Mircea Eliade as "archaic
          techniques of ecstasy," is alive and well in Mongolia as a means of
          accessing "nonordinary realities" and the spirit world. After
          centuries of suppression by Buddhist and then Communist political
          powers, it is exploding in popularity in Mongolia. Turner gives
          compelling accounts of healings and rituals he witnesses among
          Darkhad, Buryat, and Khalkh shamans, and goes on to provide us with
          his insights into a universal shamanism, principles that lie at the
          heart of shamanic traditions worldwide. This astounding, inspiring
          book will appeal to shamans and shamanic therapists, students of
          Mongolian culture and comparative religion, and fans of off-grid
          travel memoirs.

          “<i>Sky Shamans of Mongolia</i> is a fascinating and serious work that
          is an important contribution to shamanic knowledge. A must–read for
          anyone wishing to learn about Mongolian shamanism and to understand
          its place in the world.”—<b>Michael Harner, PhD</b>, author of
          <i>The Way of the Shaman</i> and
          <i>Cave and Cosmos: Shamanic Encounters with Another Reality<br /></i
          ><br />
          “As one who has worked and taught alongside Mongolian shamans, I find
          this book by Kevin Turner has illuminated much about this stunningly
          powerful and mysterious form of shamanism. He shares what he has
          learned firsthand, and he frames it in a rich context of multiple
          dimensions of shamanism, including neuroscience, and rolls it into a
          vision of shamanism as personal evolution with a vision of the future.
          Read this book!”—<b>C. Michael Smith, PhD</b>, clinical psychologist
          and author of <i>Jung and Shamanism in Dialogue</i> and
          <i>Psychotherapy and the Sacred<br /></i><br />
          “Kevin Turner’s marvelous fieldwork describes shamanism and shamanic
          knowledge as it really is in Mongolia.”—<b>L. Chuluunbaatar, PhD</b>,
          professor of linguistics at National University of Mongolia<br /><br />
          “Kevin Turner’s <i>Sky Shamans of Mongolia</i> covers a subject few
          authors have investigated in depth. In this wonderful and well-written
          text, Turner explores shamanism in the kind of detail only an initiate
          could communicate.&nbsp; Not only does Turner speak to the cultural
          role of shamans, but he reveals the experiential cosmos in which they
          journey for the benefit of community.&nbsp; I recommend this book for
          anyone interested in Asian shamanism.”—<b>Larry Peters, PhD</b>,
          author of <i>Tibetan Shamanism: Ecstasy and Healing<br /></i><br />
          “Turner’s unique qualifications make this book an immensely valuable
          resource for Westerners interested in Mongolian shamanism, or
          shamanism wherever practiced. An American living in Asia, speaking
          several Asian tongues, himself a shamanic practitioner, Turner
          possesses not only the gift of understanding but the gift of putting
          that understanding into clear, readable language. Unlike academics
          attempting to describe shamanism from the outside, Turner knows it
          from the inside, and the same familiarity that gained him the
          confidence of the shamans enables him to be a sure-footed interpreter
          for the reader.”—<b>Frank DeMarco,</b> author of
          <i>The Sphere and the Hologram<br /></i><br />
          “A fascinating and compelling account of contemporary shamanic
          practice, based on firsthand experience and simultaneously an exercise
          in religious anthropology and cultural ethnography, this work explores
          a sacred tradition whose deep impact on the West is gradually being
          rediscovered and interpreted anew.”—<b>Paul Bishop, PhD</b>, author
          of<i> The Archaic: The Past in the Present <br /></i><br />
          “Kevin Turner is an explorer of the inner worlds, a researcher of the
          deep meaning of life. His book, in addition to being an
          anthropological text, is also a travel story, full of surprises,
          between blue skies and green landscapes without boundaries, the songs
          and costumes of the shamans, their miraculous healings and visions,
          and the sterile discussions among academic scholars described with
          fine irony. [A] trip to real but extraordinary
          experiences.”—<b>Guido&nbsp;Ferrari</b>, journalist and director
          of&nbsp;<i>Tao: The Watercourse Way at Wu Yi Mountain<br /></i><br />
          “<i>Sky Shamans of Mongolia</i> is an invaluable guide for anyone
          interested in understanding one of the world’s oldest shamanic
          traditions with an abundance of detail to satisfy a curious reader or
          a serious student of global shamanism.”—<b>Robert Thé</b>, medical
          anthropologist<br /><br />
          “Kevin Turner brings a rare combination of skills and tools to the
          table, which in Mongolia opened doors and hearts normally closed to
          Western researchers of shamanism. He is a linguist, a teacher, and a
          practicing shaman. As a Western shaman, he had to endure much
          skeptical probing before being accepted by the Mongolian shamanic
          community and invited to their gatherings and healing ceremonies.
          Writing <i>Sky Shamans of Mongolia</i> from the perspective of a
          shamanic practitioner himself, Kevin Turner offers his readers a rare
          in-depth overview of the history and current practices of Mongolian
          shamanism, which after a period of persecution and decline is
          experiencing a revival of astonishing proportions.”—<b
            >Sabine&nbsp;Lucas, PhD</b
          >, Jungian analyst, and author of&nbsp;<i>Past Life Dreamwork<br /></i
          ><br />
          “<i>Sky Shamans of Mongolia</i> provides authoritative and extensive
          coverage of a little-known tradition. The writer’s personal encounters
          enliven the account, furthered by his position as a practitioner of
          ‘universal shamanism’ which enables him to enjoy privileged access.
          There are moments when the reader is so drawn in by the firsthand
          descriptions that it feels as if one were actually there.”—<b

            Religion<br /></i
          ><br />
          “The dramatic resurgence of shamanism in Mongolia, as detailed in this
          beautifully written study, is testament to the indomitable nature of
          the soul’s healing powers. Kevin Turner gives us both a window into
          shamanism as a worldwide phenomenon and a detailed account of
          ancestral Mongolian shamanic practices. Most interesting of all,
          <i>Sky Shamans</i> is that rare glimpse into the shamanic psyche,
          transmitted through these accounts.”—<b>Jeremiah Abrams</b>, author of

            Nature<br /></i
          ><br />
          “An enjoyably written introduction to Mongolian and Inner Asian
          shamanisms that is based in experience and filled with knowledge.
          Recommended.”—<b>Jeremy Narby</b>, author of
          <i>Shamans through Time</i> and <i>The Cosmic Serpent<br /></i><br />
          “Author Kevin Turner has brought something of great importance to
          those seeking to understand and practice shamanism: a valuable
          contribution to the understanding and practice of shamanism in the
          West and a richly rewarding, fascinating study of Mongolian shamanism.
          The author’s adventures in the land of the shamans brings much food
          for thought and great insight.”—<b>Nicholas Breeze Wood</b>, editor of
