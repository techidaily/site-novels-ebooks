            >The latest archaeology and history redefining book from bestselling
            author Graham Hancock (<i>Fingerprints of the Gods</i>), who is
            featured in <i>Ancient Apocalypse</i>, a hit Netflix original
            docuseries.</b
          ><br /><br /><b
            >"With the original unabridged text of <i>Supernatural</i>, I offer
            the reader an investigation that explores the human experience with
            psychedelics from the Stone Age to the Space Age and the role of
            these extraordinary plant medicines as tools to investigate the
            nature of reality itself."—Graham Hancock</b
          ><br /><br />
          Discover the pathway to the gods.<br /><br />
          Less than 50,000 years ago mankind had no art, no religion, no
          sophisticated symbolism, no innovative thinking. Then, in a dramatic
          and electrifying change, described by scientists as "the greatest
          riddle in human history," all the skills and qualities that we value
          most highly in ourselves appeared already fully formed, as though
          bestowed on us by hidden powers.<br /><br />
          In <i>Visionary</i>, Graham Hancock sets out to investigate this
          mysterious "before-and-after moment" and to discover the truth about
          the influences that gave birth to modern human mind. His quest takes
          him on a journey of adventure and detection from the stunningly
          beautiful painted caves of prehistoric France, Spain, and Italy to
          remote rock shelters in the mountains of South Africa, where he finds
          a treasure trove of extraordinary Stone Age art.<br /><br />
          Hancock uncovers clues that lead him to travel to the depths of the
          Amazon rainforest to drink the powerful plant hallucinogen ayahuasca
          with Indian shamans, whose paintings contain images of "supernatural
          beings" identical to the animal-human hybrids depicted in prehistoric
          caves and rock shelters. Hallucinogens such as mescaline also produce
          visionary encounters with exactly the same beings. Scientists at the
          cutting edge of consciousness research have begun to consider the
          possibility that such hallucinations may be real perceptions of other
          "dimensions."<br /><br />
          Could the "supernaturals" first depicted in the painted caves and rock
          shelters be the ancient teachers of mankind? Could it be that human
          evolution is not just the "blind," "meaningless" process that Darwin
          identified, but something more purposive and intelligent, something
          that we have barely even begun to understand?<br /><br />
          Previously published as <i>Supernatural</i>, this definitive edition
          includes a new Introduction by Graham Hancock as well as restored
          chapters that were omitted from the original paperback release.
