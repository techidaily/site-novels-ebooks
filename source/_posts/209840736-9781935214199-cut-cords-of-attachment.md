          "Cutting cords is not new; however, Rosetree's book is new. I am not
          aware of any other book on the market that gives theories on cutting
          cords, as well as how-to. Personally, I practiced and trained others
          on cutting cords for over 20 years. Because of my background and
          experiences I had with my clients, I feel Rosetree's book is precise
          and accurate. "Cut Cords of Attachment" would certainly have been part
          of the curriculum if it was available while I was teaching classes."--
          Irene Watson for Midwest Book Reviews"Are your interactions with your
          brother dominated by memories of childhood bullying?Does your college
          roommate always bring you down with her anger at men?Do you find
          yourself defending your life choices to your mom?Whatever the pattern,
          Rosetree says, you can preserve the relationship while cutting the
          cord that binds, freeing you in new ways."-- Brandeis University
          Magazine"Rose Rosetree mentions a client who had been to another
          healer to remove a cord of attachment. Rather than remove the cord,
          the healer had actually masked it and numbed it down. This has the
          effect of not only keeping the energetic connection in place but
          making it less conscious for healing. Energetic band-aids are not a
          solution."-- "Observations on the Way Home"
