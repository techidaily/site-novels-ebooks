          <p>
            When Oshada Jagodzinski was a child, she had otherworldly visions
            and a relationship with the dead that only her grandmother, who
            experienced the same, could understand. Jagodzinski’s astonishing
            life story details not only those early visions, but also the
            turmoil she felt before coming to appreciate, and, ultimately,
            harness her remarkable powers in service of others. Overcoming
            battles with substance abuse and her own inner demons, she emerged,
            after much healing work and study, an ordained Spiritualist minister
            and certified medium. She went on to build a fruitful career helping
            clients overcome the searing pain of loss, as well as both spiritual
            and emotional hunger.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Oshada’s story doesn’t end there. Her quest to find spiritual
            enlightenment led her to the Lakota of Pine Ridge, South Dakota, and
            the Chipps family’s well-known tradition of Yuwipi medicine men,
            dating back to Woptura, mentor to Crazy Horse. During her years with
            the family, she developed a profound understanding of the
            relationship between humans, other animals, and the earth itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oshada Jagodzinski’s memoir takes the reader on a rare and dramatic
            journey of discovery. She reveals life-changing accidents, a
            near-fatal encounter with a raging storm, spine-tingling shamanic
            rituals, a Lakota vision quest, and, ultimately, the very essence of
            what it is to be alive. Through it all, we learn what it takes to
            dedicate 45 years in service to the spirit world in order to help
            others approach a better understanding of death and grief, without
            anger or fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            For anyone grappling with questions of life and death, substance
            abuse, spirituality and the wellspring of transformative ritual,
            <i>My Life Among the Spirits </i>offers immeasurable wisdom and
            sustenance. For the rest of us, it is simply fascinating.
