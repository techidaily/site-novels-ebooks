            >Shares wisdom-bringing psychedelic experiences from authorities
            well-known in psychedelic history, therapy, and research</b
          ><br /><br />• Reveals how these scientists, doctors, therapists, and
          teachers have applied their entheogenic experiences in their
          professions, leading to therapeutic advancements, scientific
          discoveries, and healing for thousands<br /><br />
          • Includes contributions from scientific psychonaut Amanda Feilding,
          psychedelic swami Dr. Allan Ajaya, “America’s Doctor” Dean Edell,
          convicted psychiatrist Frederike Meckel Fisher, love doctor Charley
          Wininger, professor of psychedelics Thomas B. Roberts, ethnobotanical
          explorer Dennis McKenna, the “Sunshine Makers” Tim Scully and Michael
          Randall, as well as many others<br /><br />
          Over the past decade, many famous entrepreneurs and celebrities have
          begun to open up about their life-changing experiences with
          psychedelics that led to their personal successes. But less well-known
          are the wisdom-bringing psychedelic experiences of many top
          psychologists, psychiatrists, researchers, and others who have taken
          what they learned from their entheogenic experiences and applied it in
          their professions, leading to therapeutic advancements, scientific
          discoveries, and healing for thousands.<br /><br />
          In this profound book, Dr. Richard Louis Miller shares stories of
          psychedelic transformation, insight, and wisdom from his conversations
          with 19 scientists, doctors, therapists, and teachers, each of whom
          has been self-experimenting with psychedelic medicines, sub rosa, for
          decades. We hear from scientific psychonaut Amanda Feilding, founder
          of the Beckley Foundation; ethnobotanical explorer Dennis McKenna;
          research advocate and head of MAPS Rick Doblin; and the “Sunshine
          Makers”: Tim Scully, the scientist taught to make LSD by Owsley
          Stanley, and Michael Randall, the leader of the Brotherhood of Eternal
          Love. We learn about recasting “bad trips” as unfamiliar challenges
          from psychedelic swami Dr. Allan Ajaya, therapeutic uses of MDMA from
          “the love doctor” Charley Wininger, decades of insights from
          psychedelic professor Thomas B. Roberts, as well as several others.<br /><br />
          Revealing the psychedelic wisdom uncovered in spite of decades of the
          “War on Drugs,” Dr. Miller and his contributors show how LSD and other
          psychedelics offer a pathway to creativity, healing, innovation, and
          liberation.

          “I love this book! The interviews (really, intimate conversations) are
          emotionally intense, insightful, and revelatory. Each is a deep dive
          into a life transformed early on by psychedelic revelations and also
          matured, deepened, and revised over decades of continued psychedelic
          use. Finally able to be shared, here is the knowledge and experience
          of elders, shared life lessons of caring and compassion. A book of
          gifts, of gratitude, and so much to be learned.”
