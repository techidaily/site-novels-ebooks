            account of a Near-Death Experience (NDE) been so utterly different

            Storm was meant to write it and we were meant to read it." —from the
            foreword by Anne Rice</b
          ><br /><br />
          In the thirty years since Raymond Moody’s
          <i>Life After Life</i> appeared, a familiar pattern of NDEs has
          emerged: suddenly floating over one’s own body, usually in a hospital
          setting, then a sudden hurtling through a tunnel of light toward a
          presence of love. <i>Not so</i> in Howard Storm’s case.<br /><br />
          Storm, an avowed atheist, was awaiting emergency surgery when he
          realized that he was at death’s door. Storm found himself out of his
          own body, looking down on the hospital room scene below. Next, rather
          than going “toward the light,” he found himself being torturously
          dragged to excruciating realms of darkness and death, where he was
          physically assaulted by monstrous beings of evil. His description of
          his pure terror and torture is unnerving in its utter originality and
          convincing detail.<br /><br />
          Finally, drawn away from death and transported to the realm of heaven,
          Storm met angelic beings as well as the God of Creation. In this
          fascinating account, Storm tells of his “life review,” his
          conversation with God, even answers to age-old questions such as why
          the Holocaust was allowed to take place. Storm was sent back to his
          body with a new knowledge of the purpose of life here on earth. This
          book is his message of hope.
