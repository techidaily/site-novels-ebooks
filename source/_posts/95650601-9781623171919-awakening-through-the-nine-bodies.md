            >This “beautiful” illustrated guide for meditation and yoga students
            of all spiritual traditions “offers subtle and vast teachings on the
            mystery of the body and mind” (Jack Kornfield, author of
            <i>No Time Like the Present</i>).</b
          ><br /><br />
          Based on meditation practices Phillip Moffitt learned twenty years ago
          from Himalayan yoga master Sri Swami Balyogi Premvarni, this
          beautifully illustrated book is a guide to exploring the nature of
          mind and gaining a better understanding of experiences that arise
          during meditation. The Nine Bodies teachings map out a journey that
          starts with consciousness that arises in the physical body and is
          directly observable, and then travels through ever more subtle levels
          of consciousness to that which is not manifest and is only potential,
          and therefore has to be inferred. The book includes a series of
          mysterious illustrations that Balyogi created during his time of
          intense Samadhi explorations. Each illustration is a rich composition
          of symbols that express aspects of inner experiences that are almost
          impossible to express with language.<br /><br />
          Moffitt makes these teachings available for meditation students from
          all spiritual traditions to use as gateways for exploring the nature
          of mind and as additional means for tracking and classifying
          meditative experiences. Students of yoga will also find value in the
          teachings of the Nine Bodies as they provide a means for
          contextualizing and connecting with yogic teachings on chakras,
          koshas, gunas, and the Three Bodies.

          original description of&nbsp;the many layers of human consciousness,
          leading to the depths of liberating realization.&nbsp;Moffitt’s

          discover ever more subtle qualities&nbsp;of existence<i

        </h4>
        <p>
          Phillip Moffitt is a Buddhist meditation teacher and writer based in
          the San Francisco Bay Area. He has served as co-guiding teacher at
          Spirit Rock Meditation Center since 2010 and leads meditation retreats
          throughout the United States. His teacher, the Venerable Ajahn
          Sumedho, inspired his book on the Four Noble Truths,
          <i
            >Dancing with Life: Buddhist Insights for Finding Meaning and Joy in
            the Face of Suffering </i
          >(Rodale, 2008). <br /><br />Prior to immersing himself in the study
          of Theravadan Buddhism, Moffitt spent over ten years studying and
          practicing yoga with teachers in the Sivananda and Iyengar traditions.
          He has written numerous articles for both Buddhist and yoga magazines
          and journals. <br /><br />
          In addition to teaching meditation, Moffitt is the president of Life
          Balance Institute, which he founded in 1995. In his work at the
          institute, he trains individuals and groups in the principles of
          values-based leadership and living with an emphasis on how to
          skillfully make major transitions. His book,
          <i>Emotional Chaos to Clarity </i>(Penguin, 2012), presents many of
          the principles that he uses in Life Balance work. <br /><br />
          Before becoming a meditation teacher and founding Life Balance
          Institute, Moffitt was editor-in-chief and CEO of <i>Esquire </i>and
          led the successful turnaround of the magazine in the 1980s.
