            <strong>Where The Light Lives</strong> is the inspirational memoir
            of Linda Cull, a young woman from a traditional Southern European
            culture which was traumatised and fragmented by the Second World War
            and civil conflicts, and the story of her spiritual awakening
            journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Linda was born and raised in Australia, far from her ancestral lands
            and their brutality, but the effects of war and cultural
            displacement impacted her formative years through the struggles of
            her immigrant parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a teenager Linda was diagnosed with a spinal condition which
            caused her pain, disfigurement and humiliation, escalating her
            feelings of anxiety and despair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning to God for comfort and meaning, at the age of sixteen, Linda
            heard God’s voice calling her name and she had her first of many
            transcendent experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout her twenties and thirties Linda experienced out-of-body
            travels to heaven and back, encounters with God, angels, spirit
            beings and the dearly departed, culminating in a profound healing of
            her life from personal and intergenerational grief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acts of spontaneous inspired creativity, enhanced intuition,
            synchronicities, premonitions and past life visions have further
            expanded Linda’s understanding of reality and the interconnectedness
            of all life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This intimate account provides&nbsp;remarkable insight into
            spiritually transformative experiences and their after-effects, the
            nature of God, heaven and the soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a book for anyone who has ever contemplated the meaning of
            life, had a spiritual experience, hoped for true healing or wondered
            about the spiritual survival of a departed loved one.
          </p>
          <p>
            In sharing her story, Linda hopes you will remember and reclaim your
            Divine connection.&nbsp;

          "Where The Light Lives is a beautifully written account of a young
          woman's extraordinary visionary experiences. Diagnosed with a painful
          and humiliating disease of the spine, Linda Cull wanted to die.
          Without even nearly dying, she then had a series of encounters with a
          dazzling light-being that transformed her life. Similar to the classic
          near-death experience, Linda's sense of being flooded with lessons
          from a transcendent source awakened her artistic imagination, which
          launched her on a career as a brilliant painter. Her book is a
          document of hope to all and should expand the horizons of human
          psychology."<strong

          becomes normal and she is able to walk between the worlds melding this
          life and the other, heavenly side. This is a book you will want to
