            >One of “the most comprehensive, erudite, and timely” explorations
            of power dynamics and authoritarianism in religions, institutions,
            relationships and even personal struggles (<i
              >San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i
            >)</b
          ><br /><br />Authoritarian control, which once held societies
          together, is now at the core of personal, social, and planetary
          problems, and thus a key factor in social disintegration.
          Authoritarianism is embedded in the way people think—hiding in
          culture, values, daily life, and in the very morality people try to
          live by.<br /><br />In <i>The Guru Papers</i>, authors Joel Kramer and
          Diana Alstad unmask authoritarianism in areas such as relationships,
          cults, 12-step groups, religion, and contemporary morality. Chapters
          on addiction and love show the insidious nature of authoritarian
          values and ideologies in the most intimate corners of life, offering
          new frameworks for understanding why people get addicted and why
          intimacy is laden with conflict. By exposing the inner authoritarian
          that people use to control themselves and others, the authors show why
          people give up their power, and how others get and maintain it.

          “Easily the most comprehensive, erudite, and timely book … to explore
          authoritarianism in religion, institutions, power, the family,
          intimacy and sexual relations, and personal problems such as
          addiction.… Argue[s] persuasively that any system of values that
          places tradition and the past above the imperative to question the
          present is destined to become increasingly lethal.”
          <b><i>—San Francisco Chronicle Book Review&nbsp; </i></b><br />
          <br />
          “A thorough, wide-ranging analysis of the way power has historically
          been maintained.… A diagnosis of what’s wrong with the world and how
          to fix it … Its thesis is elegant and nearly unlimited in its
          ramifications.… [Shows that] authoritarianism is … part of the way we
          think.” <b><i>—The New Mexican</i> (Santa Fe)</b> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Don’t be deceived by the title. <i>The Guru Papers</i> is about much
          more than cult groups. A profoundly important critique of the covert
          authoritarianism of most religions … and of such cultural values as
          unconditional love, addiction, and 12-step programs …
          Thought-provoking and radically important …Extraordinarily rich and
          complex … An important contribution to changing [old paradigms].”

          “A breathtakingly profound analysis.… One of the&nbsp;most deeply
          insightful works of our time … Nearly every page crackles with
          statements that … provoked one ‘Aha!’ after another as I saw elements
          of culture, history, and my own experience from a new perspective that
          made immediate sense … A magnificent contribution … The most
          reasonable&nbsp;and coherent picture of the evolution of religious
          ideas to date, and brilliant sections on love and control, and …
          addiction … A vision of spirituality beyond authoritarianism … [and]
          tremendous contribution to our collective understanding.”
          <b>—Richard Heinberg, author of <i>Blackout</i></b> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Provocative and thorough.… Unmask[s] the countless manifestations of
          authoritarianism in our contemporary culture. Cover[s] vast territory
          … rais[es] all the vitally important questions …It should definitely
          be placed in the hands of anyone who has been, or is, or contemplates
          becoming involved with a guru.”
          <b><i>—</i>Georg Feuerstein<i>, Yoga Journal</i></b> <br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Expands the concept of authoritarianism and gives a new slant on the
          human condition … Shows that to overcome our staggering problems, we
          must learn to think non-authoritarian … The convincing arguments will
          make readers re-sort their thinking.”<b>

          &nbsp;<br />
          “Answers a host of questions about the source of recurring problems.…
          Unmasks the insidiously pervasive nature of authoritarian values that
          permeate society … Without awareness of how authoritarianism operates
          below the level of awareness, we too are likely to become its victims
          …Perceptive guidelines for detecting hidden authoritarianism and
          intervention strategies for self-empowerment …Deals with the most
          fundamental aspects of the Yin and Yang of human nature and the
          meaning of social community.”

          “Don’t let the title fool you … A more apt title would be “Masks of

          “Laser clarity.… Fascinating insights into the leader/follower
          relationship … [and] the usually veiled authoritarianism embedded in
          world views and values …One of the most compelling, ‘can’t put it

          “With x-ray analysis and laser precision it discloses authoritarian
          structures. It expands consciousness of the consciousness journey
          itself, exposing its ever present darker side … Even offer[s] a
          flashlight guide through this darkness. Uncompromising in its thesis,
          sparing no current idol, it is a poignant attack on the illusions of
          our times.”

        <p>
          <b>Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad</b> are co-authors of
          <i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power</i>. They have
          written and taught together since 1974 on evolution, spirituality,
          relationships, values, awareness, yoga, and social issues. Their
          website is: www.joeldiana.com.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Joel Kramer, also the author of <i>The Passionate Mind</i>, did
          post-graduate work in philosophy and psychology and was a resident
          teacher at Esalen Institute (1968-1970). He is a pioneer and legend of
          modern American yoga whose evolutionary vision of yoga freed it from
          its authoritarian roots, re-visioning it for the West.<br />
