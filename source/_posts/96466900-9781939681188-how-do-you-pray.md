            As we evolve, so do our prayers; as our prayers evolve, so do we.
            This is the evolution of illumination, the collective voice of the
            soul of the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>How Do You Pray?</i> was born from a vision in which Celeste
            Yacoboni was told to ask the world, "How Do You Pray?" She reached
            out to leading spiritual, shamanic, scientific teachers, guides, and
            activists and asked for their response. Culled from those responses
            is an original and deeply personal collection of essays. Talking
            intimately and candidly about how they pray, these personalities
            encourage the reader to contemplate the intention of prayer in their
            own life.
          </p>
          <p>
            This collection speaks to the reader's heart and asks
            <i
              >What is your soul's expression? How do you dance in ecstasy, bare
              your soul to the divine? Bow in gratitude? Merge with nature? Cry
              out for guidance? How do you pray?</i
            >

            This groundbreaking and moving book gathers responses from leaders

            Bielecki, Lama Surya Das, Hank Wesselman, Father Bede Griffiths,

          <br /><br />"If you want to learn how to be more creative, study
          Leonardo da Vinci or Thomas Edison. If you'd like to improve your
          cooking skill, watch Michael Symon or Cat Cora on "Iron Chef." And if
          you want to enrich your inner life, immerse yourself in the beautiful
          examples of prayer from spiritual teachers, visionaries and thought
          leaders in this exquisite volume. How Do You Pray? offers<br />creative
          inspiration and rich nourishment for all seekers."--Michael J. Gelb,
          author of How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci and Innovate Like
          Edison<br /><br />"This is a book that many will be putting into their
          pockets and carrying with them to inspire them on a daily basis. This
          is a book that not only inspires, but reminds us of the inner
          connection that powers this world of reality. Celeste Yacoboni has
          planted a seed to awaken our memory! Let our hearts unify as we
          celebrate our diversity and the spiritual nature we walk
          with."--Jyoti, Spiritual Director for the Center for Sacred Studies
          and Ambassador to the International Council of Thirteen Indigenous
          Grandmothers<br /><br /><br />"Each humble seeker will discern the
          language of prayer, the language of the heart, in his or her own way,
          guided by the Love that interpenetrates all existence. Nonetheless, we
          are richly fed and inspired by the words and witness of others in
          their explorations and practice within this mysterious and ultimately
          ordinary domain. In this feast of a book, Celeste Yacoboni presents us
          with dozens of invitations to stop, to listen, to let go, to wonder,
          to shout in praise, to cry with longing. Here is a gift for all lovers
          of God, whatsoever Name is assigned to that One."--Regina Sara Ryan,
          author of Praying Dangerously and Igniting the Inner Life<br /><br /><br />"The
          book exudes sacredness."--Jamal Rahman, author of Spiritual Gems of
          Islam: Insights &amp; Practices from the Qur'an, Hadith, Rumi &amp;
          Muslim Teaching Stories to Enlighten the Heart &amp; Mind
