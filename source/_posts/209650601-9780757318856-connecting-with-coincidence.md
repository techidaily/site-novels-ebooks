          We've all experienced or heard of surprising events and unexplainable
          coincidences—money that seems to come from nowhere, a spontaneous idea
          that turns into a life-changing solution, meeting our soulmate on a
          flight we weren't supposed to take, or families being reunited by
          "accident" after years of separation. <br />
          <br />Often these coincidences are explained as being controlled by a
          higher power or pure chance. But for the first time since Carl Jung's
          work, comes bold new research that explains scientifically how we can
          identify, understand, and perhaps even control the frequency of
          coincidences in our everyday lives. <br />
          <br />Bernard Beitman, a leading expert on Coincidence Studies,
          proposes a greater personal responsibility which depends partly upon
          newly discovered "grid cells" located in the brain, near the
          hippocampus. But neuroscience cannot complete the entire puzzle, and
          in this fascinating guide, Beitman provides the missing piece. From
          analyzing true stories of synchronicity from around the globe and
          throughout history, he shares key personality characteristics and
          situational factors that contribute to the occurrence of meaningful
          coincidences in our lives. Where other books on coincidences tend to
          be theoretical, inspirational, or story collections only, Beitman's
          book is the first to provide a scientific understanding and practical
          ways in which readers can use them in their own lives. He reveals:<br />
          How to activate your observing self so you don't miss synchronistic
          moments How serendipity can offer insights into solving problems or
          making difficult decisionsWhy stress activates meaningful
          coincidencesWhich states of mind impede our ability to experience
          synchronicityHow to interpret the meaning of a coincidence Why being
          attuned to coincidences is a learned skill—and how to hone your
          sensitivity.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dr. Bernard Beitman is the first psychiatrist since Carl Jung to
          attempt to systematize the study of coincidences. He is a Visiting
          Professor at the University of Virginia and former Chair of the
          Department of Psychiatry at the University of Missouri-Columbia. He
          attended Yale Medical School and completed a psychiatric residency at
          Stanford. Dr. Beitman has received two national awards for his
          psychotherapy training program and is internationally known for his
          research into the relationship between chest pain and panic disorder.
          In addition, he has edited two issues of
          <i>Psychiatric Annals</i> that focus on coincidences. Dr. Beitman is
          the founder of Coincidence Studies. His work with coincidences was the
          subject of a feature story in Men's Health.
