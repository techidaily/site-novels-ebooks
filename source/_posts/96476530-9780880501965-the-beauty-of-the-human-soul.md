          'The Beauty of the Human Soul' continues the AUTHENTIC LIVING series
          by Osho with talks by the contemporary mystic during his stay in the
          United States.<br />All of the Osho books are created from his
          extemporaneous talks, and in this volume reflect the intimate setting
          in which they were given, with small audiences of those gathered in
          the Oregon commune around him. Everything is on the table - belief in
          God, the meaning of compassion, what happens when we die. In sharing
          stories from his own life, bringing new insights to old parables, and
          challenging his listeners to examine their own conscious and
          unconscious beliefs, he begins to create a new and more authentic
          "narrative" about what we human beings are doing on this planet, and
          why we are here.<br /><br />The entire Authentic Living series is a
          manifesto of the priceless gift of individuality, of both the freedom
          and the responsibility that comes with living life according to your
          own light, free from fixed concepts and ideologies given by others
          whether that be parents, teachers, priests, or politicians. The
          challenge is to take nothing for granted, leave no sacred cow
          unexamined. And to take the courage to step into the unknown with no
          idea of what is going to happen, with great creativity, sensitivity,
          and awareness, but with no fixed ideology.<br /><br />Osho says: "You
          have to go through a transformation and that, only you can do. Except
          you, nobody can reach there. And this is the beauty of the human soul,
          that it is absolutely unavailable to anybody. Your center is so
          protected by existence that nobody can even touch it."<br /><br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          Osho, is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have
          influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.
          His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more
          and more interest, years after his death in 1990; and his readership
          is dramatically expanding around the world in more than sixty
          languages. People connect easily with the wisdom of his insights, and
          their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.
          The Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the "1,000 Makers of
          the 20th Century". He is known around the world for his revolutionary
          contribution to meditation - the science of inner transformation -
          with the unique approach of his "OSHO Active Meditations"
          acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing
          meditation into modern life.
