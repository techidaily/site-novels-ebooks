              >A guidebook for those at midlife struggling to find themselves,
              applying Joseph Campbell’s <i>Hero’s Journey</i> to the modern
              reader’s quest for wholeness. </b
            ><br /><br />Those reaching midlife often discover that they have
            been bombarded with messages from society telling them who they
            should be and what their life should look like. While chasing the
            three-headed monster (achievement, perfection, and the approval of
            others), author Ben Katt realized that he had lost himself along the
            way. <i>The Way Home </i>is a book for those struggling to find
            their way back to themselves, especially at midlife.
            <br /><br />Katt distills Joseph Campbell’s
            <i>Hero’s Journey</i> into an accessible, ten-step program to help
            readers move beyond their limitations, find fulfillment, and make
            the greatest possible contribution to their community and world.
            Anyone – ordinary, extraordinary, or somewhere in between – can
            embark upon the Hero’s Journey, leaving the familiar, falling into
            the unknown, and ultimately rising to wholeness.<br /><br />Bringing
            together personal experience, spiritual wisdom, and well-known
            mythologies, <i>The Way Home</i> serves as a practical guidebook to
            inspire and equip people in the second half of life, helping them
            move from isolation to belonging, from security to surrender, from
            conformity to wildness. Katt employs a number of tools and rituals
            to guide readers along the path back to themselves, including
            solitude, dreamwork, fasting, and meditation.<br /><br />This book
            serves as a reminder to those at a transition point in their life
            that the most important task is to stay connected with their own
            heart.

          "A fantastically written, powerfully wise offering from Ben Katt to
          his generation, especially to men of his generation – and thus a gift
          to our world of pain and promise.” <br />–<b>Krista Tippett</b>,
          award-winning broadcaster and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author<br /><br />"Katt aims in his spirited debut to help middle-aged
          readers 'grappling with anxiety' and 'lost in loneliness' recover
          their purpose....From biblical figures to movie heroes, the 'universal
          way home to wholeness' is an arduous but eminently human trek, Katt
          concludes. This inspires."<br />–<i>Publishers Weekly<br /><br /></i
          >"Well organized, deeply thoughtful, and vivid in its encouragement to
          follow the call. At times comforting both in its awareness of what a
          reader in midlife may be struggling with and in its assurances that
          the more uncomfortable stages of the Hero’s Journey do eventually lead
          back to hope and purpose."<br />–<i>Englewood Review of Books</i
          ><br /><br /><i>"The Way Home</i> is a powerful story and an
          invitation, especially for those who are asking what it means to come
          home to ourselves and embark on the complex journey of being an
          adventurous, vulnerable human. Through Ben’s visceral and honest
          storytelling, we remember what it means to be alive, to go deep within
          ourselves when we have no idea what we will find. The wisdom provided
          in this book comes from the ideas of
          <i>grace, space, and pace, </i>and will guide us forward, no matter
          where we are on the journey. All humans long to find expansive places.
          I’m grateful this book is a guide into those spaces, helping us find
          the power of language and gift of story along the way."<br />–<b
            >Kaitlin B Curtice</b
          >, award winning author of <i>Native</i> and <i>Living Resistance</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>The Way Home</i> offers timely guidance for a
          timeless tangle: how do we fully show up to our lives? Ben shines a
          fresh light on what homecoming actually means and why finding
          wholeness matters for how we relate to ourselves and others. This book
          shows great heart and will be welcomed by anyone courageously willing
          to trade the familiar, risk the unknown, and engage the mythic,
          intimate practices of being truly free, alive, awake.” <br />—<b

          ><br /><br />"Heartfelt and honest storytelling that's packed with
          wisdom. Ben Katt's <i>The Way Home </i>is a powerful guide for those
          searching for more meaning and connection—especially men in their
          midlife."<br />—<b>Scott Shigeoka</b>, author of
          <i>SEEK: How Curiosity Can Transform Your Life and Change the World</i
          ><br /><br />"Ben's courageous and vulnerable offering of his own
          personal myth serves as a powerfully relevant map for those who have
          lost their heart in the process of striving to create a fulfilling
          life based on the often tattered directions we inherited from family
          and society. I pray that all those who are seeking, especially my
          brothers who feel lost without a map, somehow, someway, find this one
          in their hands."<br />–<b>Aubert Bastiat</b>, founder of Sacred Sons
          <br /><br />"I have never read anything that illuminated my own life
          more, illuminating my own journey with dangerous, remarkable clarity.
          Ben Katt's <i>The Way Home</i> is the rare book that
          <i>happens to you.</i> These stories will crack open your own stories;
          these words will give you language you can find yourself in. This is
          sage wisdom without any of the pretentiousness--soulful, vulnerable,
          tender, experiential. <i>The Way Home</i> is also rare in that it
          fully delivers on the title--if home is what you long for, this book
          will absolutely guide you there."<br />–<b>Jonathan Martin</b>, author

          <i>How to Survive a Shipwreck,</i> director of the Center for
          Spiritual Life at DePauw University <br /><br />"I spend a good
          portion of my life walking with middle aged people (mostly men) who
          have come to the end of what our Western versions of identity and
          vocation have offered us. They feel bored, disconnected and searching.
          They are desperate for a journey toward wholeness that animates a life
          marked by tenderness, joy, presence and meaning. This book offers a
          desperately needed vocabulary, practice and lived experience of that
          journey."<br />
          –<b>Jon Huckins, </b>author of <i>Mending the Divides </i>and lead
          guide for the Journey Home Cohort<br /><br />"If it hasn't happened to
          you already, one day you're going to feel the grief and disorientation
          of being far away from your true home with no precise way to trace
          your steps back. Let <i>The Way Home</i> be a compass, and Ben Katt, a
          guide."<br />–<b>Pamela Ayo Yetunde</b>, pastoral counselor and author

          ><br /><br />"<i>The Way Home</i> is a practical and inspiring guide
          for those who find themselves in the midst of the midlife transition.
          Katt shares his deep wisdom cultivated through his own journey through
          the travails of a midlife transition, in a practical, compassionate,
          and poignant way helping readers to reframe the midlife crisis as an
          invitation to wholeness and an exciting new chapter of the journey of
          life. This book will be the go-to guide for the next generation of
          adults approaching midlife."<br />–<b>Brandan Robertson</b>, author of
          <i>Dry Bones and Holy Wars: A Call for Social and Spiritual Renewal</i
          ><br /><br />"<i>The Way Home</i> is moving, thoughtful, and a
          heart-centered gift for those who are embarking on their own hero's
          journey. In other words, it's a guide for the journey that each of us
          must undertake."<br />

          ><br /><br />“Toward the end of this book, Ben Katt describes the
          memorabilia he keeps in his office. Small containers for uncontainable
          memories. That’s what this book is: a collection of words that gather
          meaning, decisions, regrets, changes and joy in stories and questions.
          Ben is a kind guide, and a clear one: he notices the small things,
          enquires with curiosity and intelligence, queries meaning and
          belonging, inviting conversation and attention.”<br />–<b

          describes the transformative stages of The Hero’s Journey in usable,
          relevant and relatable terms. And he shares the intimate details of
          his own journey, the struggles and the expanded awareness that comes
          from trading in mediocrity for mysticism. You may just feel as though
          you’ve gone on a pilgrimage, and you will definitely feel inspired to

          on a journey through personal pain to the suffering of the entire
          human family. Through his compelling, poignant and humorous
          storytelling we are invited again and again to surrender our own
          resistance to reaching the end of our ropes and to being surprised by
          grace."<br />–<b>Killian Noe,</b> founding director of Recovery
