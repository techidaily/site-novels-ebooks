            <i>The Children of Now</i> is a groundbreaking work that shows that
            a large number of kids come into the world bearing inherent gifts
            that are beyond strange—they are telepathic, understand subtle
            energies, and/or have amazing psychic abilities. Many of them
            remember where they were before they came to Earth and often can
            describe past lives. Many doctors mislabel them as autistic, ADD,
            ADHD, or suggest other behavioral difficulties. More than half the
            time, these doctors are wrong. <i>The Children of Now</i> are not
            defective—they are differently functional. We are doing ourselves
            and the world a great disservice by not acknowledging these amazing
            children and their special gifts. A surprising percentage of these
            children carry within themselves wisdom far beyond most adults. The
            phenomenon is very real, and more and more of these highly evolved
            children enter our world every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>The Children of Now</i> offers not only genuine stories of many
            children who have brought amazing talents into our world, but also
            practical, easy solutions to assist society in supporting and
            nurturing these gifted—not defective—children and their families,
            rather than labeling, segregating, and condemning them. Fascinating
            to anyone with an open mind, and life-illuminating for parents with
            these incredible kids, Meg offers detailed answers derived from
            counseling real kids in real families. <i>The Children of Now</i> is
            a must-read for every parent, teacher, caregiver, and child
            advocate. In it you'll discover:<br />Why our children's DNA is
            different from previous generations'.The traits and needs of the
            Crystalline Children.The Children of the Stars and why they are
            here.Real stories of real children as Dr. Meg helps them and their
            families search for answers.Why these kids are exhibiting telepathy,
            telekinesis, healing abilities, and more.How to help the Children of
            Now at home, at school, and socially.
