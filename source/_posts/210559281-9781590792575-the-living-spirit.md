          I have written <i>The Living Spirit </i>not just for healers, but for
          anyone who wants to awaken to their soul's mission and to the
          incredible plan God has for them. It is intended as a compassionate
          and supportive guide for others beginning their spiritual journey as
          mediums, psychics, and energy healers or simply for those with
          questions about who they are, what life is all about, and whether
          there is indeed life after death. In short, it is the book I wish I
          had on that night all those years ago. In gratitude for my spiritual
          gifts, I made a commitment to live according to the universal laws of
          energy and to share all I've learned with others.&nbsp; This includes
          helping others to conquer their childhood fears and limitations so
          their souls can mature. As our souls grow and expand, our physical
          lives expand and abound in abundance. It is my hope that by reading
          the personal stories shared by a host of people and those from my
          daily life, it will become apparent to you that each of us is more
          than we appear to be. We can transform our selves and our world into a
          place that reflects the best of our divine gifts. When one shifts to
          living in conjunction with spirit, and to moving through their
          emotional issues with new vision and expertise, anything is possible.
          Another major emphasis of this book is to share the miraculous
          happenings and coincidences that have proven to me, a former skeptic,
          that life is not random, and all our experiences are the way to a
          higher understanding of self. There are three main points that I hope
          readers take away from The Living Spirit: &nbsp;
          <i
            >-We are divine soul beings interconnected to each other and to the
            universal energy that supports all of us. &nbsp; </i
          ><i
            >-Life is not random.&nbsp; Throughout our lives we will experience
            a series of coincidences that are not coincidental at all, but
            Spirit, whispering words of love and guidance in our ears. &nbsp; </i
          ><i
            >-Our loved ones in afterlife guide us to expand our understanding
            of our soul nature and our physical lives. &nbsp;
          </i>
          I invite readers to share this journey with me and learn to let go of
          any restriction preventing their full enjoyment of life. Once we
          become aware of how we can recognize and utilize coincidences,
          synchronicities, and higher guidance, we ca we can begin our
          exploration of what these mean in our lives and in our role in the
          world. We all have the Divine-given abilities to repair our wounds and
          misguided thinking. Through meditation and energy work like Reiki, we
          can learn to quiet the mind of negative chatter and learn to find that
          place within where we are sure of God's love and guidance.
