            <strong>The Seven Laws of Teaching</strong>&nbsp;is a clear and
            simple statement of the important factors governing the art of

            teachers and now finds new relevance among those educating their
            children at home as well as with educators advocating a conservative
            approach.

            <strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</strong><br /><strong
              >John Milton Gregory</strong
            >
            was one of the educational leaders of the generation that has just
            passed from the stage. He was born at Sand Lake, in Rensselaer
            County, New York, on July 6th, 1822. His early training was obtained
            in the district schools and he became himself a district school
            teacher at the age of seventeen. Three years later, apparently
            destined for the profession of law, he entered Union College at
            Schenectady, New York, But after graduating in 1846, he gave up the
            study of law to enter the ministry of the Baptist Church. His heart,
            however, was in teaching, and in 1852 he became head of a classical
            school in Detroit, Michigan. Almost immediately he was recognized as
            a leader in the educational councils of the state.<br />In 1868,
            when the University of Illinois was established under the name,
            'Illinois State Industrial University,' Dr. Gregory was asked to
            undertake the organization of the new institution. His work for
            thirteen years in laying the foundations of one of the largest and
            strongest of the state universities gives him a secure place in the
            history of American education. After leaving the University of
            Illinois he served for sometime as a member of the United States
            Civil Service Commission. The great work of his life, however, was
            the organization of the University, and just before he died in 1898
            he asked that his body be laid to rest within the campus of the
            school for which he had done so much.
