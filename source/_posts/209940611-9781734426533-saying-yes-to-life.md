            There is no specific guidebook for this adventure called life; it is
            the journey itself to pay attention and say yes to.
          </p>
          <p>
            Saying Yes to Life is a loving invitation for people who long to
            live life more fully after spending too much time with their noses
            in the guidebooks, thinking everyone else knows best, and missing
            out on the beautiful views all around.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sensory-filled portrayal of travelling from a place of heavy
            obligations to a heart-centred life filled with lightness and love,
            Marjorie Warkentin takes you on a journey to:
          </p>
          notice where you have been ignoring your intuition and pushing through
          at all costs.&nbsp;explore what it looks like to trust more fully,
          face uncertainty more courageously, live more authentically, and,
          ultimately, be a true leader of your life.embrace the messy path of
          adventure full of magical experiences with arms wide open, remembering
          that you are safe and never alone.&nbsp;
          <p>
            By the end of the trail, you will be invited to follow your inner
            wisdom and be true to yourself; discover you no longer need to
            depend on external guidance when you come to a crossroads; and see
            it’s possible to live a life filled with love and grace.
          </p>
          <p>And it all starts by saying “yes”!&nbsp;</p>

          “This story of a journey from caution, obligation, and dependency to
          curiosity, adventure, and a YES to life is everybody’s story. This
          book is a useful reminder of what is possible for us all.” — Peter
          Block, speaker, consultant and author of The Answer to How is Yes and
          Community: The Structure of Belonging
        </p>
        <p>
          “This book takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery, inviting
          each of us to remember that the simplest path in life will always be
          found with a conscious connection to your true self.”&nbsp;— Bronwen
          Sciortino, simplicity expert and international author of three books,
          including The Economy of Enough
        </p>
        <p>
          “One woman's inspiring journey toward self-actualization and
          self-determination.” — Joanna Bergen, feminist and human rights
          activist
        </p>
        <p>
          “Saying Yes to Life provides a unique guidebook for trails that women
          will encounter from young to senior adulthood. The writer has a way of
          taking the unfoldings of ordinary life and gleaning wisdom from them.
          She recognizes that many women struggle to put their true desires into
          words, and she seeks to model this trail of self-care and courage. A
          joy of nature grounds this book in beautiful landscapes.” — Janet E.
          Boldt, mentor, educator and business owner of Madrona Mentoring &amp;
          Soul Care
        </p>
        <p>
          “Beautifully written, this is a heartfelt companion and guide to women
          in times of transition and the book to pick up when life isn’t going
          the way you want. This book is like sitting down with your wisest
          girlfriend at her kitchen table; warm, honest and wisdom-filled. When
          you get up to leave, you know you will never experience life in quite
          the same way as before. Saying Yes to Life is a book about living
          courageously, leaving the reader feeling that being who you are is the
          greatest adventure of all.” — Amy Biondini, energy healer
        </p>
        <p>
          “Saying Yes to Life takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery,
          inviting each of us to remember that we are the leaders of our own
          lives. An antidote to burnout, overwhelm, and chronic stress so many
          women are experiencing today, each path is an invitation to liberate
          the Wise Woman, discover more of our true authentic selves, and open
          to receive the abundance of life.” — Cathryn LeCorre, MEd, leadership
          coach and educator
        </p>
        <p>
          “Using narrative ideas and practices, Marjorie Warkentin courageously
          protests the dominant ‘expert’ stories of family and society which
          tend to inhibit and constrain women’s personal development. Saying Yes
          to Life articulates the ‘re-authoring’ of Marjorie’s story through the
          discovery of her inner wisdom, personal values, and authentic
          expression. This creative and sensuous narrative provides a helpful
          guide for the traveler who chooses to embark on a journey that brings
          forth the inner wisdom of the ‘emerging woman.’” — Evangeline Willms
          Thiessen, MAMFT, DMin; systemic family therapist and clinical
          supervisor
        </p>
        <p>
          “Full of personal stories and insights regarding inner transformation,
          Saying Yes to Life is bound to inspire and awaken the hearts of many
          as they walk their own journey.” — Cathy AJ Hardy, retreat facilitator
          and spiritual director
        </p>
        <p>
          “Saying Yes to Life is a book about the embodied feminine. Marjorie
          Warkentin helps lead us back home to ourselves through her stories of
          trust, surrender, compassion, and listening to our inner knowing. This
          beautifully written book takes the reader on a journey of
          self-discovery, inviting each of us to remember our inherent
          worthiness and majesty.” — Alison Lee, coach
