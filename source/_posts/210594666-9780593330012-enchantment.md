            book, I'm telling God's honest truth. I didn't know how much I
            needed someone else to validate what I was going through. The sense
            that I had lost my curiosity, my imagination, my ability to make
            meaning.” –&nbsp;NPR Morning Edition host Rachel Martin</b

            “Gentle inspiration for those who feel exhausted or helpless… May
            shows how paying deliberate attention to what’s around us can

            From the <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling author of
            <i>Wintering</i>, an invitation to rediscover the feelings of awe
            and wonder available to us all</b
          ><br /><br />
          Many of us feel trapped in a grind of constant change: rolling news
          cycles, the chatter of social media, our families split along partisan
          lines. We feel fearful and tired, on edge in our bodies, not quite
          knowing what has us perpetually depleted. For Katherine May, this low
          hum of fatigue and anxiety made her wonder what she was missing. Could
          there be a different way to relate to the world, one that would allow
          her to feel more rested and at ease, even as seismic changes unfold on
          the planet? Might there be a way for all of us to move through life
          with curiosity and tenderness, sensitized to the subtle magic all
          around?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>Enchantment</i>, May invites the reader to come with her on a
          journey to reawaken our innate sense of wonder and awe. With humor,
          candor, and warmth, she shares stories of her own struggles with work,
          family, and the aftereffects of pandemic, particularly feelings of
          overwhelm as the world rushes to reopen. Craving a different way to
          live, May begins to explore the restorative properties of the natural
          world, moving through the elements of earth, water, fire, and air and
          identifying the quiet traces of magic that can be found only when we
          look for them. Through deliberate attention and ritual, she unearths
          the potency and nourishment that come from quiet reconnection with our
          immediate environment. Blending lyricism and storytelling, sensitivity
          and empathy, <i>Enchantment</i> invites each of us to open the door to
          human experience in all its sensual complexity, and to find the beauty
          waiting for us there.

          PRAISE FOR ENCHANTMENT<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “I love Katherine May’s new book, <i>Enchantment</i>. She is so smart,
          tender hearted, thoughtful.&nbsp; It’s actually enchanting, so wise
          and lyrical, down to earth and mystical, personal and universal. It’s
          a beautiful offering of light, truth and charm in these strange, dark
          times.” – <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Anne Lamott<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Katherine May gave so many of us language and vision for the long
          communal ‘wintering’ of the last years. Welcome&nbsp;this beautiful

          &nbsp;<br />
          PRAISE FOR&nbsp;KATHERINE MAY’S PREVIOUS WORK<br /><br />
          “A beautiful, meditative book…It feels like Katherine May opens up
          exactly what I and so many need to hear but haven’t known how to
          name.”&nbsp;–&nbsp;Krista Tippett, On Being<br /><br />
          “There is power and clarity and wisdom to be gained from accepting
          these difficult times. <i>Wintering</i> offered me&nbsp;empathy,
          acceptance and perspective that will stay with me long after the
          pandemic.” <i>–&nbsp;New York Times</i><br /><br />
          “Honest and deeply sympathetic...proves that there is grace in letting
          go, stepping back and giving yourself time to repair in the dark...May
          is a clear-eyed observer and her language is steady, honest and
          accurate—capturing the sense, the beauty and the latent power of our
          resting landscapes.” <i>–&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “May writes beautifully….A contemplative, hopeful, consoling
          book.”&nbsp;–&nbsp;NPR<br /><br />
          “A gorgeous book, a generous book, a layered book of uncommon
          sensitivity and substance…A splendid and soul-salving
          read.”&nbsp;–&nbsp;Maria Popova, <i>Brain Pickings</i><br /><br />
          “<i>Wintering</i> is every bit as beautiful and healing as the season
          itself. Katherine May thoughtfully examines the emotional, spiritual,
          and geographical reality of the cold times, the dark days, and those
          periods of our lives when things are neither soft nor easy. In so
          doing, she offers a great and humane service to her readers: she shows
          us that wintering cannot be avoided, but need not be feared. This is
          truly a beautiful book.”&nbsp;– <i>New York Times</i> bestselling
          author&nbsp;Elizabeth Gilbert
