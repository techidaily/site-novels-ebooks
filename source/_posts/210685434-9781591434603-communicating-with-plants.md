          <b>A step-by-step guide to Plant communication</b><br /><br />•
          Explains the synergistic process of communicating with a Plant and how
          the Plants help us overcome anxiety, grief, fears, and limiting
          beliefs and teach us to trust, forgive, and embrace self-love<br /><br />•
          Shares teachings from a variety of Plants such as Yarrow, Mugwort,
          Maple, Dandelion, Poison Ivy, and Japanese Hops<br /><br />• Presents
          step-by-step activities and practices that allow you to actualize each
          Plant’s teaching in an immediate way<br /><br />Everyone has the
          ability to consciously communicate with Plants. Jen Frey shows that if
          we are willing to listen, we can hear the Plants speak to our Hearts
          and teach us how to heal. With the support of our Plant allies, we can
          be our truest selves and remember our intrinsic wholeness.<br /><br />In
          this step-by-step guide, Frey shows how to awaken your ability to
          directly receive the unique wisdom and healing gifts of Plants. She
          describes how communicating with Plants is more like a communion than
          an exchange of words. The primary language we share with Plants is
          through the Heart, and Plant communication brings an expansion of
          Heart intelligence and emotional growth. She explains how the Plants
          help us overcome anxiety, grief, fears, and limiting beliefs and teach
          us to trust, forgive, embrace self-Love, and enjoy the sweetness of
          life.<br /><br />Sharing teachings she has received from a variety of
          Plants, such as Yarrow, Mugwort, Maple, Dandelion, Poison Ivy, and
          Japanese Hops, Frey follows each Plant ally’s wisdom with a
          step-by-step activity or practice. She includes both native and
          invasive Plants because all Plant Spirits have valuable lessons to
          share. She concludes with Tulsi, showing how this Plant is essential
          to helping us recover our Sacred nature, especially in a time of great
          Earth changes. <br /><br />With the wisdom of Plant Spirits, we can
          have support and guidance whenever we need it and live in co-creative
          partnership with Nature.

          “There are special people sensitive enough to hear the conversations
          happening all around us between our green kin. The plants choose these
          folk to speak for them—to translate their meanings and intentions into
          words. Jen Frey is one of these people. She straddles both worlds and
          generously shares her ways of making those connections. A heartwarming
          book.”
