          For 20 years of his life Frank had always tried to find a place to
          belong in the world that seemed to do its very best to make him an
          outcast. Frank's life changed when he discovered that all the troubles
          he had gone through had come with opportunities. In the world that
          keeps telling us to change who we are and become something else Frank
          discovered that the route to a happy and fulfilling life was hiding in
          the trials and tribulations he had gone through. In the world where we
          are being told to fix ourselves, Frank encourages his readers to find
          their true self because that is were their voice is. In the world that
          tells you that you need more money, a bigger house and a lot of
          friends in order to be happy, Frank encourages his readers to go on a
          journey to discover who they are.Finding your voice begins with Frank
          being bullied on day one of primary school as a six year old to
          eventually finding his true voice in his late twenties. Every chapter
          consists of lessons that every experience good or bad taught him and
          how they are serving him today and how they can serve the reader. It
          is a journey full of tears, laughter, suicidal thoughts and eventually
          arriving at a meaningful place in life. From being scared of speaking
          to people to winning speech contests to inspiring thousands. This is
          the story of how six year old Luanshya, Northern Zambia who had
          nothing going for him but a dream, how he used his past to arrive at
          meaningful place in his life.
