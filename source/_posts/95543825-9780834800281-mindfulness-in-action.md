            >“One of the great spiritual leaders of all times” offers
            mindfulness meditations and guidance on how to bring awareness into
            everyday life with “an illuminating wisdom that dances through every
            page” (Tara Brach, PhD, author of <i>Radical Acceptance</i>)</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The rewards of mindfulness practice are well proven: reduced stress,
          improved concentration, and an overall sense of well-being. But those
          benefits are just the beginning. Mindfulness in action—mindfulness
          applied throughout life—can help us work more effectively with life’s
          challenges, expanding our appreciation and potential for creative
          engagement.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This guide to mindful awareness through meditation provides all the
          basics to get you started, but also goes deeper to address the
          questions that naturally arise as your practice matures and further
          insight arises. A distillation of teachings on the subject by one of
          the great meditation masters of our time, this book serves as an
          introduction to the practice as well as a guide to the ongoing mindful
          journey.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />

          Rinpoche.”<br /><b>—Pema Chödrön</b><br /><br />“With simplicity and
          warm-hearted wisdom Chögyam Trungpa invites you to discover your own
          mindful dignity and presence. These earthy and profound meditation
          instructions give you courage… encouragement to step beyond your
          habitual self to discover spacious awareness&nbsp;and embodied
          compassion.”<br /><b
            >—Jack Kornfield, author of <i>The Wise Heart</i></b
          ><br /><br />“From one of the great spiritual teachers of all times, a
          book on mindfulness that inspires a fresh and open engagement with our
          inner and outer world. &nbsp;This guide to meditation has
          psychological depth, humor and, above all, an illuminating wisdom that
          dances through every page.”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“<i>Mindfulness in Action</i> is one of the best
          introductions to the practice of mindfulness that I have read. It is
          accessible, fresh and filled with real world advice on how to bring
          awareness and gentleness into the busyness and pressure of our
          everyday lives. . . . which will contribute to reducing the anxiety
          levels of our society as a whole.”<br /><b

          ><br /><br />“Reading <i>Mindfulness in Action</i> feels like sitting
          with a good friend. The kind voice, thoughtful words and rich
          territory of discussion are a lovely gift for newcomers and seasoned
          meditators from all traditions.”<br /><b

            author of <i>Real Happiness at Work</i></b
          ><br /><br />“In <i>Mindfulness in Action</i>, a highly trained
          meditation master shows us—in stunningly simple language and
          images—how mindfulness is not a single event, but rather an unfolding
          journey of discovery that will sustain us throughout our entire life.
          It’s an important contribution to the growing body of mindfulness
          writing.”<br /><b

            of <i>The Mindfulness Revolution</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Here Chögyam Trungpa shows us how, by
          <i>simply sitting still</i>, we can reconnect with the profound
          gentleness and luminous wisdom of being human. Whether you are new to
          mindfulness or an experienced practitioner, this text is indispensable
          for learning how to wake up to the vastness and goodness of everyday
          life.”<br /><b

            <i>The Mindful Leader</i>, and <i>Fearless at Work</i></b
          ><br /><br />“In 1973 in Vermont, Chogyam Trungpa taught me the basics
          of mindfulness in a startlingly relevant way, leading twenty years
          later to my addressing what he called America's “super-sized problems”
          by teaching mindfulness to leaders in education, business, law,
          environment, science, and activism. &nbsp;His powerful presence is
          alive in this book—including his fierce wisdom, his honest and loving
          compassion, his fabulous unsparing sense of humor, and his thoughts on
          the state of America. I can’t imagine a more valuable book at this
          time.”<br /><b
