          A step-by-step guide to working with the runes throughout the year
          <br /><br />• 2019 Nautilus Silver Award <br /><br />• Explains how
          the 24 runes of the Elder Futhark each rule the calendar for a
          half-month <br /><br />• Details the runes most powerful during each
          runic half-month, what they portend for personal and spiritual
          wellbeing, and techniques for creating relationships with them
          <br /><br />• Includes structured devotionals for each half-month and
          runic initiation rituals for the 8 pagan Sabbats, or holy days, such
          as the Summer Solstice (Litha) and Lughnssadh (the first harvest holy
          day) <br /><br />The Old Norse runes, known as the Elder Futhark, have
          long joined forces with the cycles of the seasons to offer powerful
          initiations, guidance, and wisdom. Aligning the sacred festivals,
          plantings, and harvests of ancient runic calendars with our modern
          12-month calendar, Kelley Harrell reveals how the runes can once again
          offer initiations as well as instruct us on the holy days and creative
          rhythms of today. <br /><br />Drawing on her more than 25 years of
          shamanic practice and runic study, Harrell offers a step-by-step
          primer to work with the runes throughout the year. She explains how
          the 24 runes of the Elder Futhark follow a seasonal progression in
          which each stave rules the calendar for a half-month. She explores the
          meaning of each rune in detail and presents structured runic
          devotionals for each half-month, interwoven with guidance on how to
          make the best use of the life force available during each season, as
          well as runic initiation rituals for the 8 pagan Sabbats, or holy
          days, such as the Summer Solstice (Litha) and Beltane (May Day). She
          details the runes most powerful during each half-month, what they
          portend for personal and spiritual wellbeing, techniques for creating
          relationships with them, and how to work with them as an oracle. The
          author also explains how the runes leading up to each Sabbat help
          create the space for properly greeting each calendrical transition and
          completing its initiation. <br /><br />By moving through Nature’s
          cycle with the runes, each year becomes a reliable and trackable
          process of personalized growth and spiritual connection. Progressing
          through the teachings of each stave while honoring the seasons,
          Harrell’s year with the runes becomes an initiation into a direct
          relationship with powers of Nature.

          "Drawing from old runic sources and modern shamanic practices, as well
          as over two decades of experience, Harrell aligns the classic
          agricultural calendars of Old Europe as expressed through the runes
          with our modern Gregorian variety, showing just how universal the
          wheel of the year can feel when properly attuned and actively
          experiences. Each rune (and its half-month) is examined and treated as
          an initiating force with depth and intuitive analysis. Looking to
          expand your experience of meditation with the Futhark ever-further, or
          perhaps needing a way to augment your Coven’s calendar with a more
          heathen feel? This little gem might be for you."
