          <p>
            Right from the get-go I was never going to believe that we were not
            meant to be happy! At just 15 years of age the thought of spending
            the rest of my life in misery because we werent put on this earth to
            be happy was a thought too frightening to conceive. As I projected
            this sentiment forward and imagined the long years ahead, then and
            there I made the commitment that I was going to find the pathway to
            happiness: that I would live a joyful life.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time I had reached my middle years this commitment had become
            an obsession. During this lifetime, I would find the keys to
            happiness. Whatever it took, joy was my goal and I wouldnt rest
            until I found it. With glimpses of happiness along the way, I was
            motivated and driven.
          </p>
          <p>
            Love yourself first! What does that mean? How do you do that? There
            were lots of great suggestions but very few helpful guidelines.
            Entrenched in a middle-income mindset I held many limiting beliefs
            that kept me squarely where I was. But for an enquiring mind and a
            fearless heart that had almost lost its desire to fight on, I may
            have drowned in the mire of unworthiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Little by little the pieces of the puzzle came together. My journey
            took me to explore both inside and out: what others had to offer and
            the filters through which I was living my life. A woman on a
            mission, I wouldnt let it go until I had discovered the answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joy! We <i>are </i>meant to be joyful. We <i>are </i>meant to be
            happy.
