            >A compassionate and straightforward guide to the spiritual process
            of death and spirit communication</b
          ><br /><br />• Answers the most common questions asked by the author’s
          clients over her decades of work as a spirit speaker and psychic
          medium<br /><br />• Presents simple techniques for helping loved ones
          cross over and shares practices to honor our beloved dead and connect
          with ancestral spirits<br /><br />• Shares thought-provoking stories
          of spirit contact and synchronicities that occurred for those who had
          a loved one in the dying process<br /><br />We are all curious about
          the mystery of death. Whether facing our own, assisting a loved one in
          their last days, or grieving the loss of someone dear to us, we all
          have questions about dying and what happens to our soul after we
          depart physical form. <br /><br />In this compassionate and
          straightforward guide to the spiritual process of dying and what
          happens after death, psychic medium Salicrow answers the most common
          questions asked by her clients over her decades of work as a spirit
          speaker. Seeking to normalize the spiritual aspects of end-of-life
          care, she explains how active dying exists outside of normal reality,
          in a state in which the dying person and their caregivers often
          experience a heightened state of consciousness. Describing how the
          spirit is separate from the body and continues to exist after death,
          she shares thought-provoking stories of spirit contact and
          synchronicities that occurred for those actively involved in the dying
          process. She reveals how these encounters are common and act as
          guideposts along the journey into death, helping to ease the
          transition. She offers simple techniques for helping loved ones who
          are stuck or struggling to cross over and shares practices designed to
          help honor our beloved dead and develop living relationships with our
          ancestral spirits. <br /><br />Presenting an outline of what may be
          experienced during the dying process and beyond, Salicrow explores the
          time when a soul is actively dying or recently departed. She explains
          the multiple ways spirits reach out to communicate with us and
          provides a deep understanding of the signs, symbols, and sensations
          that spirits use to contact us as well as ways to strengthen that
          connection. She also explores challenging situations such as suicide,
          murder, and healing unresolved issues with the dead.
          <br /><br />Crafted through years of spirit communication sessions,
          this guide details how the spirit world works while revealing the
          beauty, healing, and love that exist in death.
