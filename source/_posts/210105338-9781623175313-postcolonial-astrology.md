            >Tapping into the political power of magic and astrology for social,
            community, and personal transformation.</b
          ><br /><br />In a cross-cultural approach to understanding astrology
          as a magical language, Alice Sparkly Kat unmasks the political power
          of astrology, showing how it can be channeled as a force for
          collective healing and liberation.<br /><br />Too often, magic and
          astrology are divorced from their potency and cultural contexts:
          co-opted by neoliberalism, used as a force of oppression, or distilled
          beyond recognition into applications that belie their individual and
          collective power. By looking at the symbolic and etymological
          histories of the sun, moon, Saturn, Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Jupiter,
          we can trace and understand the politics of magic--and challenge our
          own practices, interrogate our truths, and reshape our institutions to
          build better frameworks for communities of care.<br /><br />Fearless,
          radical, and fresh, Sparkly Kat's <i>Postcolonial Astrology</i> ushers
          in a new wave of astrology revival, refusing to apologize for its
          magickism and connecting its power to the spirituality and politics we
          need now. Intersectional, inclusive, and geared towards queer and POC
          communities, it uses our historical and collective constructs of the
          planets, sun, and moon to re-chart our subconscious history, redefine
          the body in the world, and assert our politics of the personal, in
          astrology and all things.

          "The author...helps readers understand [astrology] as a magical,
          political, and intersectional language&nbsp;with a rich history that
          extends beyond Western ideologies."&nbsp; <br />—<i
            >Publishers Weekly&nbsp;</i
          ><br /><br />
          <br />"[Alice Sparkly Kat's] analysis strikes that rare balance of
          being richly contextualized and accessibly written, making this
          'history and toolkit'&nbsp;an essential addition to any queer
          astrology lover’s library." <br />—Logo,&nbsp;<i>NewNowNext</i>
          <br /><br />“Alice Sparkly Kat asks us one of the most important
          questions that can be asked of any profession: Can we make astrology
          responsible for its impact thus far and into the future? It’s a
          necessary interrogation and the only way to truly show how much we
          love and care for this ancient art and much-needed practice.”<br />—Chani
          Nicholas, author of <i>You Were Born For This<br /></i><br />“As a
          student of astrology for over a decade, I am incredibly moved by the
          audaciousness, the humor, and the sublime realness of this book. It’s
          a book that strikes a challenge: How do we move forward dislodging
          ourselves from the cruel machinations of white supremacy and
          colonization? How do we claim ourselves for our bright, collective
          future? I saw myself in this book, and it was a bold, timely<br />reckoning!”<br />—Faria
          Róisín, author of <i>Like a Bird</i><br /><br />
          <br />"Many people do astrology, and some of them know from where the
          tradition emerged. But very few rigorously consider how and why the
          language of astrology has developed in relation to power. With a
          critical eye and expansive research, Alice Sparkly Kat examines the
          historical significance of astrology’s symbols to trace an alternative
          genealogy of modern Western astrology. This important work is crucial
          to a discipline as steeped in tradition as astrology is; without a
          deep consideration of history, how can we create space for new
          astrologies to root and take hold?" —Banu Guler, Founder &amp; CEO of
          Co – Star<br />&nbsp;<br /><br />"Alice Sparkly Kat’s
          <i>Postcolonial Astrology</i> does something immensely paramount: its
          sweeping analyses rip off the togas worn by Western astrology’s
          planetary gods that Rome appropriated from the Greeks. Sparkly Kat
          shows how their loosely woven fabric drapes nothing but White
          privilege created at the expense of stolen land and the labor of
          people of color for millennia. In their book, there is no lapsing into
          trying to track astrology’s depths through the jungles of Jung’s
          putative collective unconscious. No awestruck adoration of Western
          astrology’s masquerade of itself as a path toward transcendence, a map
          for the evolution of consciousness, or a gateway for freedom from the
          tortures of our supposed ids, egos, or superegos. Instead, Sparkly Kat
          stays rooted in a body of critical theory and postmodern analysis to
          expose Western astrology, as an “anachronistic archive” and a
          myth-making machine more for racism and maintaining Whiteness at the
          expense of the poor and people of color. Yet, Sparkly Kat doesn’t
          commission the reader to discard all Western astrology’s borrowed and
          tattered notions. They instead direct us to look at the shredded heap
          of its motley meanings as just one important story that can indeed be
          told differently. We can learn to connect the dots of astrology’s
          fabled constellations of motley meanings, assembled with blood and
          burglary, in ways that create a canopy of heaven that includes all
          peoples of Earth and leaves us whole and restored." —Samuel F.
