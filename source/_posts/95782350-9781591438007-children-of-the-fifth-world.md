          Our species is evolving in preparation for the new world on the
          horizon <br />
          <br />• Explains how the increase in intuitive, creative, and
          abstract-thinking abilities of children as well as incidences of ADHD,
          dyslexia, and autism signal evolutionary changes at work in
          humanity--the emergence of the Fifth Root Race <br />
          <br />• Connects the appearance of these traits with ancient myths and
          evolutionary calendars as well as predictions by Teilhard de Chardin,
          Edgar Cayce, and other visionary seers <br />
          <br />• Reveals how these “new kids” act as agents for world change by
          reflecting back every misguided aspect of business, politics,
          religion, and culture <br />
          <br />The past 30 years have seen a quantum leap in the intuitive,
          creative, and abstract-thinking abilities of children as well as an
          unprecedented rise in incidences of ADHD, dyslexia, and autism
          spectrum disorders. As P. M. H. Atwater explains, we are witnessing
          evolution at work. The changes in consciousness and brain function
          evident in these “new kids” signal the widespread emergence of the
          Fifth Root Race and, fortuitously, coincide with our transition into
          the Fifth World. <br />
          <br />Providing a resource for parents and new kids themselves,
          Atwater explains what is happening to our species and our world--from
          neurological changes and climate upheavals to the drive to be
          constantly “connected” through screen-based technology and the
          unnecessary widespread use of drug therapies. Sharing individual case
          histories underscoring the traits of the new-child personality, she
          reveals how these children, born with universal consciousness encoded
          in their DNA, act as agents for world change by reflecting back every
          misguided aspect of business, politics, religion, entertainment,
          technology, and culture so we can’t ignore what needs to be repaired.
          Atwater shows how children labeled as autistic or otherwise “damaged”
          have enormous potential for greatness. <br />
          <br />Connecting recent events and cultural shifts with creation
          myths, evolutionary calendars, and historical records from every
          culture as well as predictions by Teilhard de Chardin, Sri Aurobindo,
          Edgar Cayce, and other visionary seers, Atwater shows how the genetic
          shift now occurring follows the “Rule of Thirds” in its progression.
          Exploring timelines for the next several hundred years, she explains
          that the coming new world will be tailored specifically for the new
          kids, who will lead the way in the Great Shift from old world to new.

          “In this book Ms. Atwater will give the reader, young or old, much to
          consider, much to learn and outline decisions to be made for the
          future. I recommend this book in the first instance for parents and
          teachers. Secondly, for the new children to read for themselves when
          they are ready. Development of these children cannot simply be left to
          chance. To fully prepare themselves for life in the new millennia,
          they absolutely must be guided.”
