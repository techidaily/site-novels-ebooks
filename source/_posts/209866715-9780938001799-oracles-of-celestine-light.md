            ><br /><br /><strong>WHAT WAS LOST...HAS BEEN FOUND!</strong
            ><br /><br />This is the complete 808 page trilogy of the Celestine
            books of Light: Genesis, Nexus and Vivus.<br /><br />The
            controversial Oracles of Celestine Light, is a portal in time to the
            days of Yeshua of Nazareth, over 2000 years ago, revealed in
            fulfilling detail to the world by the reclusive Embrosewyn Tazkuvel.
            It includes 155 chapters of sacred wisdom, miracles and mysteries
            revealing life-changing knowledge about health, longevity, happiness
            and spiritual expansion that reverberates into your life today.<br /><br /><strong

              measure, as you remain true to your light."</strong

            your soul."&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong
          >Laura Castaneda<br /><br />"This book, is a revelation to read. I've
          always had religion in my life, but its been on the peripherals. The
          bible just never really made any sense to me. It's teachings seemed
          too -- for a lack of a better word -- archaic. The Oracles of
          Celestine Light, though, feels anything but archaic, to my surprise.
          It's a grand tome of faith, philosophy, drama, and wisdom. Its scale
          and wonder is like reading an epic like Ulysses, or the Iliad. While
          the bible may feel archaic, Oracles feels ageless. As if this was the
          story we were supposed to have been told, but instead got the "safe
          for work" version everyone reads now in the Bible."&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie<br /><br />"The Oracles will make your mind explode
          with deep thoughts on how the world works and the meaning of
          life."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anita Leung<br /><br />"If you want a vivid
          description of our true history, read the Oracles. I recommend it to
          anyone, even those that are not religious, because underlying it all
          there is a message of peace, tolerance and love, all of which are
          lacking in our present world. You can return to it at any point, when
          in times of doubt and when you are in need of comfort and inspiration
          to overcome challenges. It's a marvelous work, truly."&nbsp;

          "‘Once in a lifetime comes a book that can dramatically change your
          life for the better – forever – this is it.’ So it says on the back of
          The Oracles of Celestine Light. But don’t they all promise that? Yes,
          they do. This is what virtually all authors want their readers to
          believe. Yet, I have not come across one single book in my whole
          lifetime that has such a broad promise and actually fulfills it. Not
          one book EXCEPT THE ORACLES OF CELESTINE LIGHT! This is the most
          amazing and extraordinary book I have ever stumbled on in my lifetime
          and take that from an avid reader. It is a Godsend; a literal gift
          from God that presented itself at a time of great need in my
          life."&nbsp; &nbsp;Brother of Light from Europe
        </p>
        <p>
          "Amazing book! Anyone who believes they haven't been told the full
          truth from their religions should read this book. There is much more
          to know about who we are then we are being taught in our religions.
          Embrosewyn is a very gifted person who has been able to bring us the
          words of Yeshua. This book has already started to change my life
          knowing how important this life is to our eternal existence by the
          choices we make."&nbsp; &nbsp;Keyl
