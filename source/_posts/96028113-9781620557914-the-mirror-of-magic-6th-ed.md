          A collector’s edition of the classic, illustrated, and comprehensive
          history of magic and the occult <br /><br />• Written by renowned
          Surrealist and magic scholar Kurt Seligmann (1900-1962) <br /><br />•
          Includes all 250 illustrations from the original 1948 edition
          <br /><br />• Explores magical practices and beliefs from their
          origins in the ancient world through the heyday of secret societies in
          the 18th century <br /><br />In the occult classic
          <i>The Mirror of Magic</i>, renowned Surrealist Kurt Seligmann
          (1900-1962) draws from his encyclopedic practitioner’s knowledge and
          extensive antiquarian collection to offer a comprehensive, illustrated
          history of magic and the occult from Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt
          through the 18th century. He explores the gods and divinatory arts of
          the legendary Sumerians and the star-wise Babylonians, including the
          birth of astrology. He examines the afterlife beliefs of the ancient
          Egyptians and the dream interpretation practices and oracles of
          ancient Greece, including the mysteries of Eleusis and the magical
          philosophy of Plato, Socrates, and other Greeks. He uncovers the
          origins of Gnosticism and the suppression and banishment of magic by
          the post-pagan, Christian emperors of Rome. <br /><br />Seligmann
          reviews the principles of alchemy, sharing famous transmutations and
          allegorical illustrations of the alchemical process and explores the
          Hermetica and its remarkable adepts. Investigating the Middle Ages,
          the author discusses the work of European magicians of the time,
          including Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Agrippa, Nostradamus, and Pico
          Della Mirandola. He studies the medieval practices of devil worship,
          witchcraft, and black magic, as well as the “Cabala” in both its
          Hebrew and Christian forms. He also examines the art of the Tarot and
          many lesser known divination techniques. He explores the development
          of secret societies, including Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, in the
          17th century and the increase in occult publications and magical
          science in the 18th century. <br /><br />First published in 1948, this
          history of magic and the occult seeks to “mirror” the magical
          worldview throughout the ages. Beautifully illustrated with images
          from the author’s rare library, this collector’s edition features all
          of the artwork--more than 250 images--from the original 1948 edition.

        <p>
          Kurt Seligmann (1900-1962) was a Swiss-American Surrealist painter and
          expert on magic, known for his extensive collection of rare books and
          his monumental role in the popularization of Surrealism in the United
          States. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he was the first
          European Surrealist to arrive in New York. After the war his work was
          exhibited widely and acquired by museums throughout the United States
          and Europe. He taught for many years at various colleges in New York
          City.
