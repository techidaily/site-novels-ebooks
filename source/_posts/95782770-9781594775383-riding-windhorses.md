          The first book written about Mongolian and Siberian shamanism by a
          shaman trained in that tradition.<br /><br />• A thorough introduction
          to Mongolian and Siberian shamanic beliefs and practices, which, until
          the collapse of the Soviet Union, were banned from being practiced.<br /><br />•
          Includes rituals for healing and divination techniques.<br /><br />In
          traditional Mongolian-Buryat culture, shamans play an important role
          maintaining the tegsh, the "balance" of the community. They counsel a
          path of moderation in one's actions and reverence for the natural
          world, which they view as mother to humanity. Mongolians believe that
          if natural resources are taken without thanking the spirits for what
          they have given, those resources will not be replaced. Unlike many
          other cultures whose shamanic traditions were undermined by modern
          civilization, shamans in the remote areas of southern Siberia and
          Mongolia are still the guardians of the environment, the community,
          and the natural order. <br /><br /><i>Riding Windhorses</i> is the
          first book written on Mongolian and Siberian shamanism by a shaman
          trained in that tradition. A thorough introduction to
          Mongolian/Siberian shamanic beliefs and practices, it includes working
          knowledge of the basic rituals and various healing and divination
          techniques. Many of the rituals and beliefs described here have never
          been published and are the direct teachings of the author's own shaman
          mentors.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Sarangerel, which means Moonlight in Buryat, was trained in the
          traditional Mongolian and Buryat shamanic traditions by native
          teachers who are free to practice again following the collapse of the
          Soviet Union. She was the foreign outreach representative of the
          Golomt Center for Shamanist Studies and the Mongolian Shamans’
          Association. Born in the United States after her family had been
          forced to flee Siberia following the Russian Revolution in 1917, she
          returned to her ancestral homeland in the Tunken region of southern
          Siberia in 1991 to rediscover the shamanic knowledge of her ancestors.
