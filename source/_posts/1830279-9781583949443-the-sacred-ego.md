            >Blending psychological insights with spiritual wisdom, this
            “brilliant and visionary” guide deconstructs the myth of the
            ‘selfish’ ego to provide a blueprint for fostering peace (Tara
            Brach, author of <i>Radical Acceptance</i>)</b
          ><br /><br />
          Why have we failed to create the happy, peaceful world that we all
          want? And what can we do about it?&nbsp;For more than three decades,
          Jalaja Bonheim has explored these questions in her work with women
          leaders, activists, and spiritual seekers from around the world.<br /><br />
          In <i>The Sacred Ego</i>, she tackles one of the core myths of popular
          spiritual culture—the myth of the ego, supposedly responsible&nbsp;for
          our greed, selfishness, and violence. In contrast, Bonheim approaches
          the ego as a sacred function worthy of honor and gratitude. With
          riveting stories from her work, she guides us into the depths of our
          collective psyche to pinpoint the real sources of our problems and
          illuminate our path to wholeness. Firmly grounded in a lifetime of
          practical experience, <i>The</i> <i>Sacred Ego</i> is a visionary,
          uplifting book that explains why our world is in crisis and how we can
          support the unprecedented transformational process that’s underway.
