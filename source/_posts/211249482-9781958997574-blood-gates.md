          <p>
            As cocreators with God, we have been given access to the precreation
            source and substance of all creation; the body and blood of the Lamb
            of God. The blood Jesus shed on Earth gives us righteous access to
            the Heavens and Heaven's trading floor; it is our spiritual
            passport. Jesus' sacrifice also opened a blood gate to allow the
            Kingdom of God to enter creation legally, the same way Cain offered
            Abel and opened a blood gate to grant entrance to systemic
            kingdom-building sin.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            I dedicate this work to all of those who have been sacrificed and
            offered on Cain's trading floor. Those who are living and st ill
            being offered, and those who have been offered unto death. It is
            dedicated to the countless individuals who were traded so the
            godless overlords throughout human history could thrive at the
            expense of others. These individuals include those who have been
            offered on the altar of profits by the medical and pharmaceutical
            industries, and those who have been enslaved for labor and/or the
            sex trade. Those who have known no life but a
          </p>
          <p>
            life of misery at the hands of governments, Luciferians, occultists,
            and self-serving elitists. We are coming to free you; we are coming
            to deliver you from the hands of your oppressors - help is on the
            way, both physically and spiritually.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            May the God of all peace and comfort, comfort your soul and deliver
            you. I pray you are delivered from these unrighteous systems of
            trade and their masters, and that you come to know the God of very
            Gods, YHVH, our Redeemer Jesus Christ.

            While it has become increasingly clear that we as believers must
            deconstruct the mode of governance which has been thrust upon us by
            the forces of this world, this work calls us to recognize that we
            are not without choice, but rather that the divine platform provided
            for us in the blood of the LAMB can serve as an overriding
            counterpoint to the use made of the blood of man by the God
            rejecting, and riotous abhorring world.

            As many Fathers-in-the-Faith have passed away in the last few years,
            there becomes a vacuum of Biblical knowledge going forth from
            experienced theologians. Every generation has it own revelations and
            experiences, but in-depth teaching comes only from intense study and
            understanding, Ron once again steps out in Blood Gates: The Mystery
            of Governance, to fill that void.
