            "The Way and the Spirit" is the story of the author's journey to
            discovering and coming to believe in Spiritualism. Though
            he&nbsp;was taught by the many&nbsp;Protestant Christian churches
            he&nbsp;attended throughout his lifetime that contact with the
            Spirit World is "of the Devil", the author discovered that belief
            and teaching is incorrect. An unexpected experience that occurred a
            few years ago along with his subsequent visits to Spiritualist
            churches in England and America&nbsp;changed his beliefs about
            spirit communication and have proven to him that there is
            continuation of life after our physical life ends and that
            communication with passed loved ones, in his case through mediums,
            is possible and is real. The book looks at certain conflicts in
            Christianity which caused the author confusion as to which
            demonination to follow and&nbsp;errors in the Bible that make it
            something less than the infallible text he was taught it is. He
            tells of an out-of-body experience and of messages he received
            through mediums that proved to him the beliefs of Spiritualism are
            indeed true.&nbsp;

          This book is without a doubt for the seeker of truth-- our
          spirituality and purpose on this planet. For the Christian, it offers
          an explanation of an awareness not embraced by them; it further offers
          an awakening into a broader understanding of life on the earth and its
          continuity after the change many term ‘death.’ Although the author
          rightfully claims to find fault with organized religion as many do, he
          offers an eye-awakening awareness and our purpose on earth. In his
          search for truth, he offers the truth of a whole new world of hope,
          comfort, and most of all enlightenment.<br />Too often our religious
          denomination keeps one restricted to ideas outlined by that religion.
          However, if one is to search for truth, an awakening opens up many
          doors of opportunity as expressed herein. The message brings clarity
          to physical death allowing the Spirit to move onward into a life
          beyond the grave. Although conflicts in the Holy Bible are pointed
          out, that again brings to light why one must continually search for
          truth. The author, raised as a Christian, has opened his consciousness
          to a new awareness he terms as Christian Spiritualism. The last
          section of the books brings the philosophy of Spiritualism into a new
          clarity for the reader. This book is a “must read” with an “open
          mind”. Your awakening lies within your hands as you read the Way and
          the Spirit.&nbsp;- Reverend&nbsp;Marilyn J. Awtry, N.S.T.
