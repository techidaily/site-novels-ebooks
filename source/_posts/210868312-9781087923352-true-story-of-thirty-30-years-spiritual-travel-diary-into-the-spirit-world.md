            Hello Friends, God is constantly calling His children to the place
            of perfection. In the garden of Eden, He told our first parent to
            eat everything except one of the trees. They broke the perfection
            clause and were driven out of the garden. He told Noah to prepare
            the ark according to specification and fill it up according to
            instruction. He told Abraham to walk before Him and be perfect. He
            told Moses to build the ark of the covenant according to as shown
            him on the mountain. The perfection clause continued till Jesus time
            where Jesus said, "I do nothing except what I see my Father doing
            and He is still calling us today to the place of perfection.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Over the course of thirty (30) years as a Christian, it is shocking
            that the body of Christ have relegated the topic of the spirit realm
            to third parties with completely different worldview than our own
            with damming consequences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Christian believe starts and ends - Genesis and Revelation, with
            events in the spirit realm or spirit world. You can't even expunge
            the concept of the spirit world from more than 80% of the bible. So
            why do we talk so little about spiritual world as it addresses our
            fundamental teaching in Christianity? I do believe it is as a result
            of lack of knowledge and God will always permit us to be destroyed,
            including our children, if we reject knowledge of the things of the
            spirit. Read these two scriptures
          </p>
          <p>Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 13:11 ; </strong>John 16:13</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            This true story of Evangelist Peter's dairy details ninety (90)
            encounters with the Lord Jesus Christ, with over 30 years of yearly
            40 days partial fast as instructed by the Holy Spirit where He was
            taken on spiritual travel into the spirit world and given several
            instructions which are here documented with biblical based teaching
            and worldview for our learning and application.
