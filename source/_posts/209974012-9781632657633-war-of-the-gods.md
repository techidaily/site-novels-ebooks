            >Bestselling author and father of the Ancient Alien Theory Erich von
            Däniken explores what drove ancient humans to build city-sized
            places underground around the world and its connection to conflicts
            in the sky.</b
          >
          <p>
            <i>War of the Gods</i> examines ancient scriptures from India,
            Siberia, Tahiti, and many other regions of the world independently
            on reports of battles in the stars. Weapons of unimaginable
            destructive power were used in the battle. Use of one of these
            weapons destroyed a planet completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditions from all over the world depict the gruesome effects of
            the battle in space. Many ancient stories speak of it raining fire
            from the sky for years. The people of the time tried to protect
            themselves from this, and thus created more testimonies that prove
            the star war and contact with beings from other planets.
          </p>
          <p>
            With impressive examples von Däniken illustrates some of the
            numerous cities that were dug underground as safe harbors from the
            destructive boulders. Miles and miles of underground passageways
            have been discovered around the world as they made space for
            villages and entire cities.
          </p>
          <p>
            To end the book, von Däniken presents his newest discoveries of an
            event that can only be described as shocking: In 2017, the author
            was informed that strange mummified creatures were found near the
            Peruvian village of Nazca. They lived several thousand years, had
            three fingers and three toes, and had exceptionally long heads. One
            of the mummies, apparently several thousand years ago, had been
            implanted with a metal plate under the skin. Scientists agree: These
            creatures are not from Earth!

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b> von Däniken</b> is arguably the most widely read and most copied
          nonfiction author in the world. He published his first (and best
          known) book, <i>Chariots of the Gods, </i> in 1968. The worldwide
          bestseller was followed by 40 more books, including the recent
          bestsellers
          <i
            >The Gods Never Left Us, Eyewitness to the Gods, Twilight of the
            Gods, History Is Wrong, Evidence of the Gods, Remnants of the Gods,
          </i>
          and <i>Odyssey of the Gods. </i> His works have been translated into
          28 languages and have sold more than 65 million copies. Several have
          also been made into films.
        </p>
        <p>
          Von Däniken's ideas have been the inspiration for a wide range of
          television series, including the History channel's hit
          <i>Ancient Aliens. </i> His research organization, the
          A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com (Archaeology, Astronautics &amp; SETI
          Research Association), comprises laymen and academics from all walks
          of life. Internationally, there are about 10,000. members. He lives in
          Switzerland but is an ever-present figure on the international lecture
          circuit, traveling more than 100,000 miles a year.
