          A guide to harnessing the ancient power of hieroglyphs <br /><br />•
          Reveals hieroglyphs as magical tools for manifesting ideas in the
          material world <br /><br />• Offers in-depth interpretations of 60
          hieroglyphs and guidelines for understanding them as words of power,
          oracles, and dream symbols <br /><br />• Explains how to create your
          own hieroglyph cards and amulets and use them for divination,
          meditation, and manifestation work <br /><br />Words are magic. They
          operate on many levels through both sound and symbol. Egyptian priests
          understood that language and thought could create realities if the
          exact words are uttered at the right time, properly intoned, and
          filled with intention. They called their magical language of
          hieroglyphic symbols <i>medju neter</i>, meaning “the Word of God.”
          These symbols were said to have been created by Isis and Thoth and
          were presided over by the goddess Seshet, keeper of the Akashic
          records. Through their chant lines and repetitions, sound vibrations,
          and hypnotically recurring images, hieroglyphs, such as those found
          inside the pyramids, were intended to activate a trancelike state that
          allowed the individual to ascend into the heavens and thus, riding on
          this incantatory language, converse with the ancestors and the
          Creator. <br /><br />In this detailed guide, author Normandi Ellis
          explores how to use hieroglyphs as words of power for manifesting
          ideas into the material world as well as how to utilize them in magic,
          meditation, divination, and dreamwork. She offers a deep look at the
          many layers of meaning contained within 60 important hieroglyphs,
          breaking down the elements within each symbol and explaining the myths
          behind them, the gods and goddesses they are connected to, their
          initiatory significance, and their oracular and dream meanings. She
          also shares guidelines for interpreting hieroglyphs so readers will be
          able to come to their own understandings about the secrets they hold.
          <br /><br />Providing instructions for creating your own hieroglyph
          cards, amulets, and other magically empowered objects, Ellis offers
          practices and strategies to use them, with detailed explanations for
          the historical, magical, practical, and symbolic reasons why each
          method is effective. She offers several layouts and card spreads for
          divination readings based on Egyptian myth, numerology, and astrology.
          Revealing the depth of meaning behind each of these powerful ancient
          symbols, Normandi Ellis shows that we can still harness their
          millennia-old magic today.

          “This is a work of genius! Normandi Ellis, the author of this
          mind-cracking, soul-shaking work, is a once and future priestess,
          poet, and practitioner of the mystery, magic, and spiritual arts of
          ancient Egypt. She illustrates the enormous difference between our
          material thought and what we might call our soul thought or
          hieroglyphic thought. The Egyptians lived closer to the depths of
          their intra-dimensional minds than we do. By learning to perceive
          hieroglyphically, we can tap the many levels of consciousness; we can
          accommodate ourselves to the many transformations of our time; we can
          discover the many meanings, the sacred ambivalences. By consciously
          shaping our lives through spiritual attunement by thinking
          hieroglyphically, analogically, and symbolically in charged
          multi-patterns with webs of meaning, we can begin to create changes in
          our own forms--in our bodies and our minds. Thus, we approach the
          enantiodromia, ‘the big turnaround,’ that leads to a higher and deeper
          culture for us all collectively.”
