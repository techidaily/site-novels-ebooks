              >A shame-smashing, sex-positive, no-holds-barred guide to
              understanding our desires and relationships―both our gifts and
              challenges―through astrology</b
            ><br /><br />Astrology offers a potent portal to self-inquiry,
            including into our erotic landscapes, desires, and relationships. In
            <i>Sex and Your Stars</i>, certified clinical sexologist and
            astrologer Stefanie Iris Weiss invites us to explore our sexual
            selves―as complex, confounding, and fulfilling as we are―through the
            lens of astrology.<br /><br />“Our astrology chart sets us free to
            truly know ourselves, to shed our shame, and to explore our erotic
            energy with others,” she shares. Using a revolutionary approach,
            Weiss decodes each sign’s sensual profile and helps us activate our
            sexual potential anew each month as we shift from Aries season to
            Pisces season over the course of the year. This breakthrough guide
            helps connect us to our bodies and map our ever-evolving erotic
            energy.<br /><br />With keen insight, Weiss reveals the many ways we
            relate to each sign in our unique astrology chart, and as a season
            during the year. Subsequent chapters look at desire through Venus,
            Mars, and Black Moon Lilith, with practices and meditations to
            embody what we discover. The book can help us:<br /><br />• Learn
            more about what turns us on and lights us up<br />• Give ourselves
            permission to play and experiment—alone or with others<br />•
            Appreciate ourselves just as we are<br />• Address sensitive topics,
            including libido, desire differences in relationships, sexual
            functioning, and religious conditioning<br />• Enhance communication
            and connection with partners<br /><br />This guide to the elemental,
            archetypal sexual self can help us understand our erotic desires and
            relationships in ways we may never have allowed ourselves to
            consider.

          “Stefanie Iris Weiss has created an experiential, dynamic, and
          completely new way to explore and heal our sexuality. This is not just
          a book; it’s a portal into the way our bodies experience the seasons
          as they shift and change, using the archetypes of astrology. Weiss
          reminds us that pleasure is a force for healing ourselves, the people
          we love, and the Earth itself.” —<b>Annie Sprinkle, PhD</b>, author of
          <i>The Explorer’s Guide to Planet Orgasm</i> and coauthor of
          <i>Assuming the Ecosexual Position</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Sex and Your Stars</i
          >
          skillfully intertwines the scientific and soulful aspects of eroticism
          and astrology. <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> introduces fresh
          perspectives, evokes new emotions, and encourages transformative
          practices through the lens of astrology. This work serves as a vital
          addition to the astrological canon, providing valuable insights that
          both inform and inspire without judgment. A compelling read, it offers
          essential support in reclaiming pleasures and embracing a more vibrant
          and fully alive existence.” —<b>Colin Bedell</b>, author of
          <i>A Little Bit of Astrology </i>and <i>Queer Cosmos</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Sex and Your Stars</i> is a novel approach to solving
          sexual dilemmas using the language of astrology. The book shows us how
          to smash shame, engage with our desires, and choose to prioritize
          pleasure. A groundbreaking book that should be on the shelves of all
          sexuality professionals, it introduces innovative tools to help us
          understand and heal our bodies (and our souls), setting the stage for
          erotic empowerment and connection.” —<b>Patti Britton, PhD</b>,
          founder of Sex Coach U and author of <i>The Art of Sex Coaching</i
          ><br /><br />“Many of us are looking for ways to understand ourselves
          better. We want to learn more about our sexual and romantic needs,
          what we require from a partner in order to feel safe and fulfilled,
          and how to express our emotions in a healthy manner. We want to be the
          best partner we can be to the person(s) we love, but we also don’t
          want to sacrifice too much of ourselves. We want a different approach
          to our analysis and introspection. <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> offers
          just that: a different way of thinking, a different set of questions,
          and a different way to view ourselves, our relationships, and the
          world. It’s a must-read for the spiritual soul who’s been feeling a
          little stuck.” —<b>Zachary Zane</b>, author of <i>Boyslut</i
          ><br /><br />“Even if you don’t happen to be a keen believer in
          astrology, <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> is a wise book packed with
          profound insights, using the frame of our unique erotic archetype as a
          creative way to explore ourselves as sexual beings. As a sexologist,
          Ms. Weiss gets it, as evidenced by this quote: ‘Learning what feels
          good may seem like it should be a “natural” process, but often, it’s
          buried in layers of shame and societal ideas of what we’re “supposed”
          to look and feel like, no matter our sexual or gender identity, race,
          ability, age, or body type.’ <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> can help the
          reader engage with enthusiasm and playfulness in the quest to restore
          sexual pleasure as a healing force.” —<b>Nan Wise, PhD</b>, author of
          <i>Why Good Sex Matters</i><br /><br />“Stefanie Iris Weiss has
          combined her considerable talents as a certified clinical sexologist
          and professional astrologer to help us forge our own unique path to
          sexual liberation. The journey to sexual sovereignty begins with
          shedding shame and finding pleasure in our own bodies.
          <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> shows us how to use astrological archetypes
          to move toward erotic embodiment, making space for deep intimacy,
          transcendent passion, and secure bonds with our lover(s). A delightful
          read and an important contribution to both astrology and sexology.”
          —<b>Barbara Carrellas</b>, author of <i>Urban Tantra</i
          ><br /><br />“Reading Stefanie Iris Weiss’s
          <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> is orgasmic in just the way she wants it to
          be—starting in your brain. As a sexologist and an astrologer, Weiss
          draws on her expertise, experience, and transformative stories from
          her client files with concrete steps to move readers past any shame to
          become more of their true erotic selves. Although you can pick it up
          and read for your Sun, Moon, or rising sign, you’ll gain much more
          from reading through the complete book. We have all twelve zodiac
          signs along with three archetypes of desire (Venus, Mars, and Black
          Moon Lilith) within us, and Weiss shows us how to bring our whole
          chart alive in our bodies with a lively and loving touch.” —<b

          “Combining her decades of experience in both astrology and sexology,
          Stefanie Iris Weiss has written an illuminating and practical
          guidebook on how to live a life infused with more pleasure,
          sensuality, and erotic empowerment. Not only is
          <i>Sex and Your Stars</i> a stellar treasure for anyone wanting to
          more fully embrace and align with their passions and desires, but I
          can see it being an essential resource for astrologers looking for
          additional ways to help their clients live deeply meaningful and
          enriching lives.” —<b>Stephanie Gailing</b>, author of
