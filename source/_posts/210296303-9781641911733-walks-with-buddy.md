            This book, Walks with Buddy (and Thoughts on Christ and Church),
            actually started out as a collection of short stories I submitted to
            my church's newsletter, the Miles Post. My church's name is Miles
            Memorial United Methodist, which is located in Norfolk, Virginia.
            The stories began in 2009 when I became the finance chair at my
            church. I found that while walking my dog, Buddy, I began having
            many thoughts about my surroundings, and many seemed to pertain to
            being finance chair as well as the church. With Buddy by my side, I
            had many interesting reflections, but I wasn't always sure where
            they were coming from, as I had never been a very religious person,
            so I decided the ideas were coming from Buddy himself. I adopted
            Buddy on September 11, 2008, and I can honestly say he has really
            changed my life; he has a heart of gold! Nobody has ever been a
            stranger to Buddy, this being especially true for when my mother was
            in the hospital as well as the assisted living facility. The love
            Buddy had for my mother was the same love she had for him. My mother
            was my inspiration in turning my little stories into a book to honor
            her. I am using my book, Walks with Buddy (and Reflections on Christ
            and Church), not only as a fund-raiser for my church but also as a
            way for everyone to get to know Buddy and maybe be drawn closer to
            Christ and their own church as well.
