            “A timely and penetrating analysis of spirituality’s shadow.”

          <b
            >A spiritual teacher and integral psychotherapist offers a
            first-of-its-kind study on how we use—and abuse—spiritual beliefs
            and practices, revealing how to identify and move beyond what holds
            us back from living life fully.</b
          ><br /><br />Spiritual bypassing—the use of spiritual beliefs to avoid
          dealing with painful feelings, unresolved wounds, and developmental
          needs—is so pervasive that it goes largely unnoticed. The spiritual
          ideals of any tradition, whether Christian commandments or Buddhist
          precepts, can provide easy justification for practitioners to duck
          uncomfortable feelings in favor of more seemingly enlightened
          activity. When split off from fundamental psychological needs, such
          actions often do much more harm than good.<br /><br />While other
          authors have touched on the subject, this is the first book fully
          devoted to spiritual bypassing. In the lineage of Chögyam Trungpa’s
          landmark <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>,
          <i>Spiritual Bypassing </i>provides an in-depth look at the unresolved
          or ignored psychological issues often masked as spirituality,
          including self-judgment, excessive niceness, and emotional
          dissociation. A&nbsp;longtime psychotherapist with an engaging writing
          style, Masters furthers the body of psychological insight into how we
          use (and abuse) religion in often unconscious ways. This book will
          hold particular appeal for those who grew up with an unstructured
          new-age spirituality now looking for a more mature spiritual practice,
          and for anyone seeking increased self-awareness and a more robust
          relationship with themselves and others.

          "This is a wonderfully significant and important book, and is highly
          recommended. Its contents are truly mandatory for this day and
          age."<br />—Ken Wilber, author of <i>The Integral Vision </i
          ><br /><br />"This timely and penetrating analysis of spirituality’s
          shadow provides a much-needed counterpoint for those who tend to get
          blinded by its light."<br />—Stephen Batchelor, author of
          <i>Buddhism without Beliefs</i><br /><br />"There is much wisdom and
          good information in this book. Robert joins a growing number of wise
          teachers who understand that the personal and the universal must be
          combined to bring true and genuine spiritual awakening."<br />—Jack
          Kornfield, author of <i>A Path With Heart</i> and
          <i>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry</i><br /><br />"Traversing the muddy
          waters of contemporary spirituality requires a willingness to meet its
          seen and unseen challenges with ruthless self-honesty and keen
          discernment. Robert addresses 'the many faces of spiritual bypassing'
          with intellectual rigor, hard-earned insight, and emotional
          intelligence. It is a lucid, well-written, and practical guide for
          both new and seasoned practitioners on the spiritual path."<br />—Mariana
          Caplan, PhD, author of
          <i>Eyes Wide Open: Cultivating Discernment on the Spiritual Path </i
          >and<i>
            Halfway Up the Mountain: the Error of Premature Claims to
            Enlightenment</i
          ><br /><br />"Robert Masters has given us a great gift—a tremendously
          useful guide to examining our tendencies to spiritual bypassing,
          clearly the most comprehensive and accessible treatment available on
          this crucial topic. His work is a great contribution to the ongoing
          integration of psychotherapy and spiritual practice, and to our
          understanding of the meaning of spiritual maturity."<br />—Donald
          Rothberg, PhD, author of <i>The Engaged Spiritual Life</i
          ><br /><br />"In <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i>, Robert Masters eloquently
          reminds us of something we have unknowingly misplaced on our spiritual
          journeys: Mother Earth. In our efforts to bypass our earthly
          challenges, we have disconnected from the Ground of our very being,
          seeking our wholeness on a pogo stick to the stars. In poignant and
          clarifying language, Robert calls us back home, confronting us with
          our avoidance, inviting us to find our spirituality in the
          heart/depths of our humanness. In an era where detachment models for
          spirituality are becoming dangerously prevalent, his inclusive message
          is of profound importance. It may not appeal to the part of us that
          wants the path to be easy, but it will speak loudly to the part of us
          that longs for the truth. I recommend it wholeheartedly."<br />—Jeff
          Brown, author of <i>Soulshaping</i><br /><br />"In
          <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i>, Robert Augustus Masters offers a wake-up
          call—more of a shout—to those of us who have unwittingly fallen prey
          to all manner of promising and seductive antidotes to our pain and
          suffering in the form of detached spiritual teachings and New Age
          magical thinking. The book is a sobering and powerful reminder that
          our present embodiment, in all its flawed, messy humanness, cannot be
          conveniently sidestepped, and so invites us inward to a face-to-face
          encounter and embrace with the raw truth of who we really are.
          Masters’ unique and at times disarming prose style blends a poetic
          sensibility with a surprising stark clarity that points us to 'What
          Really Matters.'"<br />—Eliezer Sobel, author of
          <i
            >The 99th Monkey: A Spiritual Journalist’s Misadventures with Gurus,
            Messiahs, Sex, Psychedelics, and Other Consciousness-Raising
            Experiments</i
          ><br /><br />"There is much hard-won wisdom in this work.
          <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> is a detailed, point-by-point description
          of how so-called spirituality can be used by some to actually avoid
          individuation, adulthood, and the <i>daimonic</i>. When Carl Jung
          noted that “neurosis is always a substitute for legitimate suffering,”
          he hinted that, especially for the Western psyche, spiritual practice
          itself can be just such a sneaky neurosis. This insightful, firm,
          confrontive yet compassionate book promotes and encourages the
          complementary marriage of spiritual practice and psychotherapy,
          recognizing that they are—and, at best, have always been—basically two
          integrally related sides of the same existential coin: The most
          profound psychotherapy is essentially spiritual; and the deepest
          spiritual quest includes some depth psychology. Neither approach can
          be excluded on the unpredictable path toward selfhood. But even the
          powerful fusion of spirituality and psychotherapy cannot offer
          transcendent perfection. Selfhood or spiritual enlightenment is never
          about escaping or distorting inner or outer reality to serve our egos,
          but requires lovingly accepting and embracing reality as it is and on
          its own terms."<br />—Stephen Diamond, PhD, author of
          <i
            >Anger, Madness, and the Daimonic: The Psychological Genesis of
            Violence, Evil, and Creativity</i
          ><br /><br />"Uncompromising and truth-telling, this book is an
          antidote to spiritual obesity. What emerges is the call to
          psychological clarity as essential to the mature spiritual life. Here
          is soul-fuel for those who would enter the road less traveled—the
          deeply examined life as part of spiritual practice."<br />—Jean
          Houston, PhD, author of <i>A Mythic Life<br /><br /></i>"The escape
          act and forms of denial and self-delusion that Robert Masters
          diagnoses as 'spiritual bypassing' have been with us for millennia —
          perhaps since our early ancestors first discovered psycho-spiritual
          experiences that seemed to relieve the pressures of living and dying.
          But the syndrome has become endemic in our frothy age of virtual
          everything — so we are all blessed by the appearance of this diamond
          of a book. Here a priest of our true wellness has distilled the blood,
          sweat, and tears of his decades of fervent triage work in trenches of
          bypassing into essences of truly healing wisdom. Every spiritual
          practitioner would do well to study <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> again
          and again. So would every one of us who presume to teach any
          spirituality at all. Thankfully, it's as much compassionate antidote
          as prophetic critique. May it be put to grateful use as long as the
          illness it treats continues &nbsp;to ravage human bodies, souls, and
          lives." <br />
          —Saniel Bonder, founder, Waking Down in Mutuality, and author of
          <i>Healing the Spirit/Matter Split </i>and<i> Waking Down</i><br /><i
            ><br />“<i>Spiritual Bypassing</i></i
          >
          casts a critical eye on our deeply entrenched misuse of spirituality…
          Masters provides a framework for how to deal with and integrate
          ‘negative’ emotions such as anger, fear, hate and judgment into a more
          authentic way of living. While most self-help books these days seem to
          simply tell you to ‘just be more positive,’ ‘avoid negativity’ or
          ‘have more compassion,’ Masters suggests a method where we can
          simultaneously choose to be compassionate while also still choosing to
          acknowledge our heartfelt anger—without expressing it with excessive
          aggression or repressing it through denial or other practices that
          might numb our real feelings... <i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> is a must
          read for anyone who is looking for a more integrated spirituality,
          authentic relationship with themselves and others, and practical
          methods for dealing with unresolved wounds.”<br />
          —<i>Spiritual Media Blog</i><br /><br />“In my opinion, [<i
            >Spiritual Bypassing</i
          >] will become as important as Chogyam Trungpa's
          <i>Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism</i>… Masters seems to be,
          based on his writings, one of the most important minds working in
          integral psychotherapy.”<br />—<i>Integral Options Café<br /><br /></i
          >“<i>Spiritual Bypassing</i> is an exceptionally well-written book
          that is endorsed by big-time authors such as, Jack Kornfield, Jean
          Houston, and Ken Wilber. Let's support (and challenge) ourselves and
          others who can no longer see for themselves when they are blinded by
          the light.”<br />
