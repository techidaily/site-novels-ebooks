          Meditation exercises for listening to the four levels of sound, to
          still the body, quiet the mind, open the heart, and connect with the
          Divine <br />
          <br />• Details the teachings on nada yoga from the Hatha Yoga
          Pradipika with clear, step-by-step instructions to find and hear the
          inner sacred sound of nada <br />
          <br />• Explains the 4 levels of sound through a series of practical
          meditation exercises <br />
          <br />• Includes instructions for a daily nada yoga meditation
          practice as well as ways to strengthen your advanced practice <br />
          <br />The ancient practice of nada yoga is not complex. It is the yoga
          of listening. It is a journey from the noise of the external world
          inward to a place of peace and bliss, to the source of the
          transformational power of sound--the nada. By meditating on the inner
          sacred sound of the nada, we can release ourselves from mind chatter
          and obsessive thinking. We can still the body, quiet the mind, and
          open the heart to create a state of mind where joy naturally arises.
          <br />
          <br />Sharing his experiential understanding of the classic Hatha Yoga
          Pradipika, Baird Hersey offers precise, step-by-step instructions on
          how to find the inner sound of the nada. He explains the first three
          levels of sound--first, how to truly hear the ordinary sounds of the
          world around us (vaikhari); second, how to quiet the sounds of the
          mind (madhyama), such as sound memories and internal dialogue; and
          third, how to access visual sounds (pashyanti), tapping in to our
          ability to see sounds and hear colors. Mastering the first three
          levels prepares one for the fourth level of sound (para), the heart of
          the practice that connects one to the inner sound of the nada. The
          author provides detailed exercises to guide you through each level of
          sound and instructions for a daily nada yoga meditation practice.
          <br />
          <br />Hersey explains that by focusing our minds on this internal
          sound we reunite our essential self with the eternal and infinite. In
          this re-union we find bliss in both body and mind, an uplifted spirit,
          and heightened states of consciousness.

          “In his new book, <i>The Practice of Nada Yoga,</i> musician Baird
          Hersey sheds light on a yoga practice that is rare to the West. Nada
          yoga, the yoga of sound, is rooted in the Rig Veda, one of the world’s
          oldest religious scriptures. But Hersey argues that the ancient
          teachings are just as relevant—and transformative—today. Hersey
          prefers to define Nada yoga as the yoga of listening. The practice is
          a form of meditation that involves running into sounds around you and
          within you. It can be a soothing way to quiet your mind and experience
          a sense of connection with the universe by becoming absorbed in sound
          vibrations that permeate it and each of us. His book is based on his
          interpretation of various Sanskrit texts (such as the Hatha Yoga
          Padipika) and offers nearly 40 exercises to help readers learn how to
          listen more intimately with their ears and, eventually, with their
          hearts and minds. For example, one has you pay attention to a specific
          sound surrounding you and listen for subtle fluctuations in pitch.
          Another has you plug your ears and notice sounds within your body as
          you move a little. Hersey’s book is a mix of traditional teachings and
          contemporary applications that will appeal to yogis, musicians, and
          anyone wanting to deepen their meditation practice through the
          soothing medium of sound.”
