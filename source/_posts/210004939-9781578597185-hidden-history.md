            Do we, the human species, really know who we are or where we came
            from or how we originated or our place in the cosmos? Or is much of
            what we have been taught wrong or misguided or possibly even blatant
            lies intended to keep people in power and everyone else in line?

            looks at a variety of dissenting, suppressed, and forbidden accounts
            of history and the origins of humanity. It takes a broad and
            inclusive survey of historical documents, various theories, and a
            wide array of perspectives to explore what conventional wisdom might
            have gotten right and wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The book serves as a useful introduction into the suppressed
            accounts of the origins of modern civilization. It combines
            cutting-edge science with metaphysical, spiritual, and even
            paranormal views, daring to ask whether there might be a better
            explanation for humanity’s existence and the origins of civilization
            than the current scientific consensus.

            <i><b>Hidden History</b></i> looks at the multiverse and parallel
            dimensions, the ancient alien theory, metaphysics, and hypotheses
            beyond physical perception, the eleven dimensions of string theory,
            radio telescopes that penetrate to the event horizon of our
            universe, mathematical equations that take us where no one has gone
            before, and the world-wide sharing of experiences old and new that
            speak of long forgotten ancient mythologies that reveal historical
            truths.

            With more than 120 photos and graphics, this tome is richly
            illustrated. Its helpful bibliography provides sources for further
            exploration, and an extensive index adds to its usefulness. This
            fascinating book is a thorough investigation and examination of the
            mysteries surrounding early civilizations, their myths, legends,
            histories, monuments—and lasting legacies.

          “… a big book, packed with interesting material (some of it new) and
          well illustrated … while rehashing much that we have heard before over
          the last few decades, it is a tighter, broader and more thoughtful
          overview than most.” – <i>Fortean Times</i>
