            >From a former army officer and author of
            <i>UFOS and the Deep State</i>, a new examination of a UFO sighting
            in a New Mexican arroyo.</b
          ><br /><br />The UFO landing at Socorro has been wrapped in
          controversy almost from the moment that police officer Lonnie Zamora
          watched a craft descend and land. Zamora saw alien beings near the
          craft and a symbol on its side but was told that he shouldn’t mention
          either. <i>Encounter in the Desert</i> reveals—for the first
          time—exactly what he saw in that arroyo in 1964 and what an
          examination of the landing revealed to investigators. Socorro wasn’t a
          stand-alone case. Other sightings, some of them nearly as spectacular
          as Zamora’s, were reported at the time. A study of the Air Force
          investigation of this case reveals an effort, at first, to learn the
          truth that mutated into a clever attempt to hide the information from
          the public. <i>Encounter in the Desert</i> reveals all this and much
          more, including:The first new, in-depth look at the Zamora UFO landing
          in more than three decades.Other reports of alien creatures sighted
          around the country at the same time.An examination of the physical
          evidence found on the landing site.The revelation that there were
          other witnesses to the craft and the landing.<br /><br />
