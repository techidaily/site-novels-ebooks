          <b>Cassie Uhl </b>is the owner and founder of Zenned Out, a jewelry
          store brand aimed at normalizing spirituality in the common
          marketplace. Zenned Out handcrafts jewelry with meaning and provides a
          community that inspires a mindful and spiritual lifestyle. Cassie grew
          up with an open-minded, astrology-obsessed grandmother and a father
          who would take her and her sister star gazing in the wee hours of the
          night. These experiences shaped Cassie and Zenned Out into what they
          are today by bringing spirituality and astrology into the forefront.
          Cassie hopes to give spiritual souls a place to feel at home on the
          Zenned Out blog and offers handcrafted jewelry with meaningful
          symbols, powerful gemstones, and mindful quotes to enable people to
          wear jewelry that aligns with their souls’ purpose. With her Zenned
          Out series of books, Cassie has expanded her spiritual outreach to
          offer accessible and beautifully presented guides to curious
          spiritualists who want to explore their craft.
