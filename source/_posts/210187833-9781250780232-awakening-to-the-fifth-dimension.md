          famous healers and intuitives, such as Edgar Cayce, gave a great
          variety of suggestions for healing, but he did not lay hands on, or
          focus scalar energy, to the many who consulted him. Caroline Myss is a

          from so much negative and divisive rhetoric that is out there in the
          world, this book is an escape. Kimberly offers so much useful
          information on how to improve and grow spiritually, mentally and
          physically. If just for her meditations and prayers alone, I will
          carry it with me wherever I travel.

          Meredith has the gift of medical mediumship. And she can teach you how
          to align with the incoming Energy of 5D Consciousness currently
          showering the Earth Plane. Her book is a great reminder of where to
          direct my attention whenever I get knocked down by the material world.

          reality to a fifth dimensional reality attests that we are far more
          spiritual and electrical than we are chemical and physical. With this
          understanding, we can see how to heal and take better care of
