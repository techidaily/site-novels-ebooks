            filled with grace, meaning, zest, peace, and joy. </b

            >ONE OF <i>HEALTHLINE</i>’S 8<i></i>BEST MEDITATION BOOKS OF THE
            YEAR</b
          ><br /><br />With warmth and wisdom from a lifetime of spiritual
          seeking, inspirational force Agapi Stassinopoulos guides you through
          fifty-two weeks of letting go of what doesn’t work for you and finding
          what does. You’ll cultivate the building blocks of self-care
          (meditation, health, making time for yourself) and confront the common
          roadblocks we all face, like pouring your energy into other people or
          living in denial. You’ll explore your “conflict” areas, such as
          relationships, money, self-esteem, anxiety, and your childhood. And
          you’ll learn to trust your creativity, keep your heart open, and
          connect to the bigger spirit that lives inside you.
          <br />&nbsp;<br />Keep this book by your bedside. It is your loving
          companion. Be creative and have fun with it. Use it as a tool to
          unlock your goodness, and wake up to the joy of you!
