          <p>
            I woke up one morning sometime in 2001 and in between sleep and
            wakefulness I was thinking about what I had to get up and do.
            Actually, I was telling myself to get up and take care of the day’s
            task. Later that evening I started working on a manuscript that
            began almost two years earlier.&nbsp; I decided quite spontaneously
            to revise the beginning of the first chapter with what I was saying
            to myself that morning. I basically started using the book to talk
            to myself. I went from writing in the first person to writing in
            dialogue. Not only did the way the book was written change but so
            did the substance, purpose, and intent. Over the next few days,
            months and years I would often find myself writing in the present,
            which can read throughout the book. I was not writing from
            hindsight; I was expressing thoughts for the first time as I wrote
            them.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The book is large in scope and without a particular genre. Thoughts
            and emotions don’t happen in category or chronological order. Nor
            are the thoughts and emotions of a reader categorized in chronology.
            The book speaks about addiction and recovery yet is not a book about
            addiction and recovery. It speaks upon the contrast and ultimate
            uniting of one’s intellectual facilities and those of will and
            desire. Yet it is not a philosophical book. It speaks upon the
            evolution from atheism to acknowledging divine reality, but it is
            not a theological book. It speaks of the vulnerability and struggles
            of a young black male seeking manhood, but it is not a book about
            the black “struggle.”&nbsp; I detail the endeavor to become a better
            person and the inevitable pitfalls, but it is not a book about
            overcoming. It is, however, a book about the ever-changing reality
            of life, regardless of the fallacious idea that people stay the
            same.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the book was more than 25 years in the making and a large part
            of it was written in the present the book had no choice but to
            change as did the author. When I started writing in the Fall of
            1998, I figured it would take about a year or two to finish the
            book. By the fall of the next year, I had the first 3 chapters
            completed and was working on the fourth. On November 23, 1999, two
            days before I was to turn 30, my mother committed suicide.&nbsp;
            From there I would dive deep into alcohol addiction, set myself on
            fire, and be a hospital ride away from death after being stabbed 6
            times with a 7-inch boning knife.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately this book is about the inverted order of life that must
            be turned upside down and put into order. The order of love because
            anyone who loves desires to be loved. The order of wisdom because it
            is the means to practice love. And the order of service to others as
            the substance, form and purpose of life itself. I wrote about what I
            had lived while I was living it. Just prior to completing the
            manuscript I realized that writing a book helped me survive while
            circling the brink of death.
