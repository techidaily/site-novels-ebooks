            >An invaluable guide and companion for anyone seeking greater
            meaning and purpose in life.
          </b>
          <br /><br />
          A nominee for the Books for a Better Life award! <br /><br />
          As a pioneer in the field of life coaching, Laura Berman Fortgang has
          spent decades helping people figure out what they want to do with
          their lives. And so it was a bit of a surprise when a theme she heard
          repeatedly from clients emerged in her own thinking and would not be
          dismissed: work didn't feel as "meaningful" to her as it once had. It
          was one of those big realizations one has from time to time. The funny
          thing was that it turned out the "solution(s)" to her problem were
          quite small... <br /><br />
          In <i>The Little Book on Meaning</i> Laura Berman Fortgang reveals
          that while our hunger for a meaningful life can be enormous, our
          desire for meaning is usually satiated by small, bite-size morsels of
          meaning-the small, almost incidental events or "achievements" that
          comprise the fabric of our lives. According to Fortgang, meaning is
          where you look for it, and through tenderly drawn stories from her own
          life and the lives of those around her, she shows readers how they too
          can peek around corners to discover the small elements of their lives
          that truly matter.
