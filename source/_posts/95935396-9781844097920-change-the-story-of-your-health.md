          The story of our health is more in our control than we might think,
          according to clinical psychologist, Jungian analyst, and shamanic
          practitioner Carl Greer, PhD, PsyD. We can not only reframe our
          experiences but actually experience less stress, greater well-being,
          and even better physical health than it might appear if we are willing
          to identify our health story and begin rewriting it. Through
          journaling exercises and expanded-awareness practices, many of which
          involve working with and in nature, and which are influenced by
          Jungian and shamanic traditions, anyone can tap into hidden resources
          for healing and work with them effectively. Whether gaining insights
          and balancing energies outdoors, dialoguing and interacting with the
          earth or a river or lake, or working with dreams, an inner healer, or
          a symbol encountered on a shamanic journey, readers will find they are
          able to learn why they have struggled to change their habits and will
          be empowered to experience greater wellness within a satisfying health
          story. "Change the Story of Your Health" focuses on four key chapters
          of a person’s health story: • Eating and drinking, and weight •
          Movement/exercise, flexibility, balance, stamina, and strength •
          Sexuality, body image and acceptance, and changes due to midlife
          hormonal shifts (commonly known as menopause and andropause) •
          Management of an acute ailment or symptoms of a chronic condition It
          also helps readers revise their health stories as their health changes
          as a result of aging or unexpected challenges. Gaining insights into
          their health, letting go of what is standing in the way of optimal
          health and well-being, and bringing in what is needed to make a
          preferred new health story a reality—all are possible when readers
          take on the challenge of "Change the Story of Your Health" and begin
          using the practices regularly.

          "Greer demonstrated in his first book,
          <i>Change Your Story, Change Your Life</i>, that our personal stories
          not only affect our lives but are very often written by family,
          environmental influences, and cultural context. Now he is applying
          that concept to physical health. As Baby Boomers age, health issues
          loom large on the world stage. Recognizing that this is the group that
          learned to meditate (in large part) because of The Beatles, he has
          merged his business acumen, clinical Jungian training, and shamanic
          experience into a healing protocol that will appeal to that market and
          the progeny that they have raised. He is telling them that if they
          change the story that they tell about health and wellness, they can
          change they way they experience those things in the physical world."
