            >A revolutionary program that can free your financial energy,
            increase your wealth, and help you achieve personal life goals</b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“Money is congealed energy,” said Joseph Campbell.
          And releasing it releases life's possibilities. . . .<br /><br />Thousands
          of people worldwide have learned how to build a powerful new
          relationship with their money and bring their dreams to fruition
          through Dr. Maria Nemeth's dynamic workshops. Now you can, too. In The
          Energy of Money, Dr. Nemeth—who received an Audio Publishers Award for
          her Sounds True series on which this book is based—draws upon her more
          than twenty years' experience in synthesizing spiritual and practical
          techniques for managing yourself and your work. Combining a complete
          self-help and self-discovery regimen with proven methods of money
          management, this powerhouse guide to prosperity presents twelve
          principles that will help you to<br /><br />• Uncover the hidden
          landscape of beliefs, patterns, and habits that underlie and sometimes
          subvert your everyday use of money and personal resources<br />• Tame
          the dragons of driven behavior and busyholism<br />• Defuse fears of
          deprivation and scarcity<br />• Embrace and work through paradox and
          confusion<br />• Consciously focus your money energy<br />• Clear
          yourself to receive the energy and support of others and the
          universe<br />• Develop and stay on your personal path to abundance<br /><br />Through
          easy-to-follow exercises and meditations, effective worksheets, and
          other interactive processes, Dr. Nemeth will guide you to financial
          success and help you manifest your special contribution to the world.
