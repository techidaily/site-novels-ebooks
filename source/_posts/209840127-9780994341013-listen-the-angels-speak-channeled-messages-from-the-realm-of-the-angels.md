          It was a cold wet day. I made my friends a hot cuppa and stoked up the
          open fire. We sat looking at the flames and talking. My voice suddenly
          changed in mid-sentence. The words I was saying were beautiful and
          elegant, but they were not mine! I was startled and confused. What was
          going on? What was that amazing energy flowing through me?After the
          initial shock, I quietened my mind enough to hear Maitreya. It was his
          energy and his words. He was with me to teach me and to work through
          me. Over the next few days, Jesus and Mary Magdalene both came through
          me with messages and energy to guide me. I realized that as each came
          and went I had an involuntary shudder. When I started to record their
          messages I found that my handwriting changed for each.Six years later,
          I still feel the amazing energies and often emotions and feelings. I
          now know that this is not just for me, but for all of humanity. No, I
          don't have to be a Saint. I just need to have pure and loving thoughts
          at the time I am receiving, and very importantly, when I am recording.
          Pure intention and loving thoughts and lots of faith in me, and in the
          Messengers, allows this remarkable gift to flow through me. I think of
          my higher consciousness as a dome. I open the door with a filter so
          only the Divine can enter. The Messenger is never a force that
          controls me. That is my deal with the Divine. I always have free will.
          The Messengers communicate to me by voice, and sometimes a knowing
          what to write in large blocks of information.I work to bring these
          amazing messages to as many as possible. Carolynn
