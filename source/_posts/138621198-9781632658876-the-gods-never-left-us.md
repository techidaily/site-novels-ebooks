              >The Long Awaited Sequel to the Worldwide Best-seller Chariots of
              the Gods</b
            ><br /><br /><i>When Chariots of the Gods </i>was published 50 years
            ago, it began a worldwide change in humanity's view of the cosmos.
            In an era of the military space race, Erich von Däniken boldly
            proclaimed that Earth had been visited by more advanced beings early
            in our history. But prescientific man had no concept of space ships,
            so he called their vehicles "chariots," and those driving the
            chariots became "gods."<br />Over the next five decades, von
            Däniken's more than 40 books built an ever-stronger case for Earth
            being visited by extraterrestrial visitors. And Chariots became an
            international best seller, with 30 million copies sold in more than
            two dozen languages. Also during that time, the case for ET
            visitations millennia ago was being reexamined by contemporary UFO
            researchers, who found evidence of modern visitations. And von
            Däniken expanded his perspective to encompass the present.<br /><br />Now,
            he presents his long-awaited sequel to<i> Chariots of the Gods</i>,
            proclaiming that the gods never left us with all-new material to
            show that ancient aliens are still with us.<br /><br /><i
              >The Gods Never Left Us</i
            >
            contends that recent advancements in biotechnology, astrophysics,
            engineering, and artificial intelligence not only give us a fresh
            perspective on his ancient astronaut theory but actually validates
            it. We are--as a race--embarking on the exact same trajectory of our
            own interplanetary colonization, just as von Däniken suggested Earth
            itself was colonized.<br /><br />ETs are definitely at work today.
            And that affects all of us.
          </p>
          Why do they do what they do? What could an extraterrestrial species
          possibly gain from observing us in the same way we look at ants?What
          have these strangers wanted for the past thousands of years?Can't they
          leave us alone?And what makes it so difficult for us to acknowledge
          the existence of these extraterrestrials?
          <p>
            That is what this book deals with.<br /><br />"Erich's newest book
            is a fascination journey from the ancient past into the present with
            a plethora of scientific evidence and documented research. As
            always, he ads his own "to the point" take on it all. Readers may
            also like that his newest work moves in a slightly different
            direction from his past books. A thoroughly enlightening and
            enjoyable Read." --Bruce Cunningham, Director, Ancient Mysteries

        </h4>
        <p>
          Erich von Däniken is arguably the most widely read and most-copied
          nonfiction author in the world. He published his first (and
          best-known) book, Chariots of the Gods, in 1968. The worldwide best
          seller was followed by 40 more books, including the recent best
          sellers Twilight of the Gods, History Is Wrong, Evidence of the Gods,
          Remnants of the Gods, and Odyssey of the Gods (all published by New
          Page Books). His works have been translated into 28 languages and have
          sold more than 65 million copies. Several have also been made into
          films. Von Däniken's ideas have been the inspiration for a wide range
          of television series, including the History Channel's hit Ancient
          Aliens. His research organization, the A.A.S.R.A./legendarytimes.com
          (Archaeology, Astronautics &amp; SETI Research Association), comprises
          laymen and academics from all walks of life. Internationally, there
          are about 10,000 members. He lives in Switzerland but is an
          ever-present figure on the international lecture circuit, traveling
          more than 100,000 miles a year.
