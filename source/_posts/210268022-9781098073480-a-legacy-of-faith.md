          <p>
            God is real, alive, and very active in the lives of people all
            across the Earth today. He has invited us to come boldly into His
            presence to make our needs and petitions known to Him. He is able to
            make a way where there is no way today as much as ever. My wife,
            Angie, and I have always believed that and determined from the
            beginning of our marriage that we would look to God first in every
            situation we faced. Our desire was to experience God stories so our
            lives would glorify Him and be a living testimony of His greatness
            in a world that attempts to undermine faith in God.This book
            chronicles the most obvious and amazing answers to prayer in our
            lives so far. Of course, we know that there are many more stories
            that are equally important but more mundane and ordinary. He has
            healed us to the amazement of the doctors involved. He has worked
            miracles of provision in our lives. He has protected us and guided
            our steps. He has been the Great Shepherd in our lives! Our hope is
            that this book will inspire you to carry all your needs to Him in
            prayer and live in expectation of His divine activity in your life.
            He wants to make your life a living testimony as well. We hope you
            will be inspired to recognize the God stories in your own life and
            build a legacy of faith that is passed on to your children and
            grandchildren. 36
