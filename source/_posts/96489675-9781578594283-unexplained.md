            What really happened? What is the truth? Should you dismiss what you
            can't explain? Or should you pay attention to the startling evidence
            and frightening personal accounts of those involved? Learn of
            hoaxes, witness the creation of various modern myths, and learn of
            frightening personal accounts and startling historical documents.
            Documenting the evidence and hearing witnesses out, Jerome Clark
            brings an engaging narrative to the stories, objectively presents
            their many possible explanations, and lets the reader make his or
            her own judgment in this one-of-a-kind book.

          "... wonderful compendium of strangeness ... This is one of those
          books you'll return to again and again for head-shaking accounts of
          how weird and wonderful this world can sometimes be." <i>About.com</i
          ><br /><br />"An excellent purchase for those curious about the
          curious." <i>Library Journal</i><br /><br />"...a very captivating
          read and a must for anyone interested in paranormal phenomena."
          <i>Booklist Online</i><br /><br />"Sometimes the medium is more
          valuable than the message, and that is true of this third edition of
          <i>Unexplained!</i> hundreds of weird, wild, and wonderful accounts of
          everything from Bigfoot to snakes living in stomachs Clark’s writing
          style is clear, dispassionate, and witty. Recommended." <i>Choice</i
          ><br /><br />"Should warm the heart of any serious observer of the
          weird world in which we live. It will disturb doubters, scandalize
          skeptics, and readjust the realities of those whose tunnel vision has
          blinded them." <i>Fate</i> magazine<br /><br />"Jerry Clark is a
          treasure of the fortean world. This is a very professional compendium
          of 64 selected topics from one of the field’s masters. Clark also
          provides definitive investigations. ... It’s a critical (in all
          senses) book; get it, read it and be better informed for it."
          <i>Fortean Times</i><br /><br />"Jerome Clack, is a fantastic writer
          and researcher ... A great new read chock full of data and stories
          that will give you a new perspective on our world."
          <i>Horrornew.net</i><br /><br />"...fresh and eminently worthwhile in
          several respects: its particular coverage, the comprehensive detail of
          its bibliographic references, the high intellectual level of its
          analysis." <i>Journal of Scientific Exploration</i><br /><br />"Though
          aimed as an introduction to Fortean phenomena, this contains lots of
          material which will be new to even the seasoned Fortean."
          <i>Magonia Review of Books</i><br /><br />"<i>Unexplained!</i> is a
          delightful book to curl up with before bed. Mr. Clark, who doubles as
          the [former] vice president of the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO
          Studies, makes no judgments, and offers no compelling hypothesis
          because after all weird stuff happens." <i>Real Crime Book Digest</i
