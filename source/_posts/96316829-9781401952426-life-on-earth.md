              >·&nbsp;What’s happening in the world lately? <br />· How can I be
              happy when so many are not? <br />· Is life about following your
              heart or taking what’s served to you? <br />· Who were the
              prophets, what areangels, and what happens when we die? <br />·
              What happened to our ancient civilizations, do secret societies
              have any real secrets, and are aliens now visiting us? <br />·
              What’s real? What matters? Who says? Who cares? <br />· How do we
              know or find our purpose?</b
            ><br /><br />Many of us ask ourselves these questions, and many
            more, as we go through our days and try to make sense of our lives.
            Mike Dooley asks them too, except . . . his questions get answered.
            Wisely. Compassionately. Fully. <br /><br />One such answer
            explained its source, stating that we all have a higher self within
            that predates this life and will live beyond it, and thus it knows a
            whole lot more than we do about where we’ve been, why we’re here,
            and what will likely happen next on planet Earth.<br /><br /><i
              >Life on Earth </i
            >takes the form of a journal in which Mike asks what’s on his mind
            during pivotal times in his life. As one of today’s most respected
            New Thought leaders and reality theorists, he offers a lofty
            platform for this wide-ranging dialogue that powerfully expands our
            perspectives on essential truths, taking on topics such as:<br /><br />·
            Why and how to see through the “illusions” of life on earth<br />·
            How to make sense of natural disasters and man-made tragedies<br />·
            Living deliberately, creating consciously, and finding your power<br />·
            Wealth, relationships, “past lives,” and the evolution of
            consciousness<br />· The ultimate reason for life on earth (it’s
            shockingly simple)<br /><br />These are questions asked from the
            heart with a cautious, even suspicious, mind. Mike explores the
            subtleties of the replies in depth and detail using his trademark
            wit and realism, in this intrepid explorer’s guide to the jungles of
            time and space.
