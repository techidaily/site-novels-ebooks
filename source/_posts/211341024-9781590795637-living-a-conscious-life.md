            Living a Conscious Life: How to Find Peace, Wholeness, and Freedom
            in a Chaotic World offers profound, prescriptive advice with a
            practical footing across a wide expanse of human experience.
            Grounded yet uplifting, factual yet inspiring, it can be considered
            a "user's manual for human beings" in its broad reach of topics, its
            depth of meaningful insights, and the transformation it brings to
            its readers. Johnson has brought a deep reverence to the diverse
            textures of his life experience in order to master the art of being
            human through awareness. Over the years, he has collected numerous
            incisive tools of consciousness to help bring success to every area
            of life. Not shying from difficult topics, in Living a Conscious
            Life, he delivers a thoughtful, one-of-a-kind guide to achieving
            perhaps the most-valuable goal in life: peace within oneself and
            success in the world. The book weaves together wisdom, humor, simple
            exercises and daily practices, and provocative questions to provide
            a read that is accessible, entertaining, easy to identify with, and
            profoundly effective.&nbsp;
