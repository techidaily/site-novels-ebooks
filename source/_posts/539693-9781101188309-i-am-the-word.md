            >The channeled Guides of <i>I Am the Word</i> provide a concise and
            immensely powerful program in self-awareness that can ease negative
            complexes and align your existence with its highest purpose. </b
          ><br /><br />Humanity has lost itself. Both as individuals and as a
          world culture, we have forgotten our true nature. In
          <b>I Am the Word</b>, writer and medium Paul Selig has recorded an
          extraordinary program for self- realization, as dispensed through
          beings of higher intelligence, sometimes called Guides or Ascended
          Masters. These figures seek, as they have in the past, to assist men
          and women in discovering the higher, purposeful nature-or "Christed
          Self"-that lies dormant within us all.<br /><br />In a series of
          enticing, irresistibly practical dialogues, the Guides of<b>
            I Am the Word</b
          >
          identify the emotional "boulders" that displace our authentic selves
          and consume our potential. The Guides provide to-the-point
          psychological and existential insights, along with self-developing
          exercises and affirmations, which begin to strip away residues of
          fear, self-doubt, and self-suffocating habits.

          <b>Praise for the author:</b><br /><br />“Generosity and compassion
          flow from Paul. His gifts help me find deeper connections to myself
          and to the world. His guidance is powerfully freeing, and, to me,
          indispensable.”&nbsp;<br /><b>—Joan Larkin</b><br />&nbsp;<br />“In a
          world of would-be psychics making great claims for themselves with
          little evidence to back them up, Paul Selig is the real
          thing.”&nbsp;<br /><b>— Rachel Pollack, author of </b
          ><i><b>78 Degrees of Wisdom: A Book of Tarot</b></i
          ><br /><br />“Paul and his Guides somehow manage to transmit and then
          explain ancient gnostic revelations in simple language that anyone can
          understand. The result is a kind of handbook on how to access and use
          the&nbsp;creative or 'out-picturing' powers of language and thought
          (our 'knowing') and the&nbsp;deep, still unconscious divinity of
          humanity (our 'worth'). A magical book.”<br /><b
            >—Jeffrey J. Kripal, J. Newton Rayzor Professor of Religious
            Studies, Rice University</b
          ><br /><br />“Through his clear, compassionate, and at times
          ruthlessly insightful spiritual guides, Paul Selig has written a
          breathtaking and powerful treatise on the importance of self worth to
          spiritual knowing. However, this is no armchair new age philosophy. It
          is a transformational manual dedicated to making this essential
          knowing accessible. I found this to be one of the most powerful and
          influential books I have ever read."<br /><b

          <span>About the Author</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Paul Selig&nbsp;</b>is an American medium and award-winning author
          of channeled literature. He was born in New York City and received his
          master's degree from Yale. In 1987, Selig had a spiritual experience
          that left him clairvoyant. As a way to gain a context for what he was
          beginning to experience, he studied a form of energy healing, working
          at Marianne Williamson's Manhattan Center for Living and in his own
          private practice. In the process, he began to "hear" for his clients,
          and much of Selig's work now is as a clairaudient, clairvoyant,
          channel, and empath. He has led channeled energy groups for many
          years. &nbsp; Selig has been featured on ABC's <i>Nightline </i>and on
          the Biography Channel series <i>The UneXplained</i>, and is the
          subject of the short documentary film <i>Paul &amp; the Word</i>. He
          often appears on <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> with George Noory. Also a
          noted playwright and educator, Selig serves on the faculty of NYU and
          directs the MFA in creative writing program at Goddard College. He
          lives in New York City, where he maintains a private practice as an
          intuitive.
