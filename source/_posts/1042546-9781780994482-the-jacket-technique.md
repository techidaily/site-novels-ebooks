        </h4>
        <p>
          Hans de Waard (1964), medical professional, developer, coach, trainer
          and now also an author. His passion is to support and encourage people
          to rely fully on their own strength and go through life relying on
          their own strength, in health and with the least amount of effort.<br />Starting
          from the end of history, the end of art and the failure of the future
          set out by such ends, Nuclear Futurism reinvigorates art, literature
          and philosophy through the unlikely alliance of hauntology and the
          Italian futurists. Tracing the paradoxes of the possibilities of total
          nuclear destruction reveals the terminal condition of culture in the
          time of ends, where the logic of the apocalyptic without apocalypse
          holds sway. These paradoxes also open the path for a new vision of the
          future in the form of experimental art and literature. By re-examining
          the thought of both Derrida and Heidegger with regards to the history
          of art, the art of history and their responses to the most dangerous
          technology of nuclear weapons the future is exposed as a progressive
          event, rather than the atrophied and apocalyptic to-come of the
          present world. It is happening now, opening up through the force of
          art and literature and charting a new path for a futural
          philosophy.<br />, <br /><br />
