          • Provides an extensive inventory of beginning, intermediate, and
          advanced tools and practices for meaningful lucid dreamwork and shows
          how dreams can shape our conscious reality if we incorporate them into
          waking life <br /><br />• Offers guidance to help you overcome mental
          or physical obstacles, including ways to stop sleep paralysis
          <br /><br />• Examines supplements to aid lucid dreaming practice and
          increase the vividness and recall of dreams <br /><br />Dreams offer a
          gateway into our psyche. Through lucid dreaming--when you have
          conscious awareness during sleep--you can access and interact with the
          subconscious mind for greater self-awareness, personal development,
          and transformation. <br /><br />In this step-by-step guide to
          dreamwork, Lee Adams provides tools and techniques for encouraging,
          remembering, and using lucid dreams for personal growth as well as how
          to have big dreams that leave a lasting impact. Beginning with an
          overview of the history of lucid dreaming, he shares tried-and-true
          foundational practices to get you started--practices for before sleep,
          during sleep, and after dreaming. <br /><br />Drawing upon Jungian
          depth psychology, recent research in neuroscience, and years of
          personal dream practice, Adams then offers an extensive inventory of
          intermediate and advanced methods to support meaningful dreamwork,
          such as the Wake Induced Lucid Dreams technique (WILD), where you fall
          asleep while conscious and transport your active awareness into a
          dream state. He also explores dream companions, symbols of the
          unconscious mind, dream interpretation, and working with the shadow
          side of the self. He examines how dreams can shape our conscious
          reality if we incorporate them or their symbols into waking life. He
          offers guidance to help you overcome any mental or physical obstacles
          you may encounter, including ways to stop sleep paralysis. He also
          examines supplements to aid lucid dreaming practice, improve dream
          recall, and increase the vividness of dreams, such as Alpha-GPC,
          5-HTP, Silene undulata, Mugwort, the mushroom Lion’s Mane, and
          Galantamine. <br /><br />With this practical guide, you can ignite
          your mind’s capacity to wake up to your own dreams and restructure
          your world to be more attuned to your deeper self.

          "Adams’ writing style is very conversational and entertaining in
          <i>A Visionary Guide to Lucid Dreaming</i>. He peppers his scientific
          data with personal examples and information from other authors, as
          well. He has definitely lived his material and it really shows in the
          pages of his book. I feel that this book is best for a serious lucid
          dreaming student. Someone who already has experience keeping a dream
          journal would really benefit from the techniques and tips Adams
          shares."
