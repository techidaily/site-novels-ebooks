            In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth because
            there was a war in heaven. At the end of that war, long before this
            new Adamic beginning, Almighty Father God gave Archangel Michael
            charge of leading the battle in casting Satan, the enemy of God, out
            of heaven. In the archangel's victory Satan was cast down to this
            God-created earth. In God's full knowledge of the pure evil that
            Satan possessed, He created man (the first one, Adam) in His own
            image. Each one of us that proceeded after that creation up to this
            very day are created as a person or piece of the Almighty God,
            endowed with the inheritance of who and what He is. God created man
            to be soldiers in His army. The purpose for our creation is to
            battle the evils that Satan would use to try to destroy us and this
            earth in his way of attacking God. In God's creation of man, we are
            "keepers of His footstool" because Almighty God is on His throne in
            heaven. Satan, having had the favor of God before he grew insanely
            jealous of Him, knew that not to be a good idea. So the very first
            man God created, Satan attacked and was successful. Satan knew that
            if he could insert his seed into the very first of God's creation,
            he would have a good chance of destroying all human beings that man
            would create. Psalm 139:14 says, "I praise you, for I am fearfully
            and wonderfully made. "In my opinion, there has never been a
            statement that has been proven more true. With Satan hiding behind
            the scene, he anxiously awaits man to explore his God-given
            creativity until man knows no limit, which ends us where we are
            today. Limitless possibilities! Constructive and destructive.
            Everything man creates is accompanied by an operating manual. In
            God's proof of all His creation, He accompanied us with one also.
            It's called the Holy Bible, which is not the story that we are able
            or want to create simply because we can, but it is His story that we
            are to follow. Like any other manual of instruction created by man
            that is unused or not read, you will undoubtedly end up with a lot
            of extra screws and pieces that do not fit. Give the Lord the
            mangled pieces of the life you have tried to put together. It's
            called surrender! It's the only way to true health, wealth, and
            spiritual freedom.&nbsp;
