          "Dr. Norman Rosenthal's <i>Transcendence</i> is the best-ever book on
          Transcendental Meditation: accessible and substantive, engaging and
          scientific, practical and profound. A very enjoyable read that can
          change your life, for good." - David Lynch <br /><br />
          "I have been meditating for over 10 years, and I found
          <i>Transcendence</i> to be a uniquely compelling introduction to the
          art and science of Transcendental Meditation. Dr. Norman Rosenthal's
          book will propel TM into the mainstream where it belongs." - Russell
          Simmons <br /><br />
          <b
            >In this definitive book on the scientifically proven health and
            stress-relieving benefits of Transcendental Meditation, a renowned
            psychiatrist and researcher explores why TM works, what it can do
            for you, and how to use it for maximum effect.
          </b>
          <br /><br />
          Norman E. Rosenthal, M.D., a twenty-year researcher at the National
          Institute of Mental Health and the celebrated psychiatrist who
          pioneered the study and treatment of Season Affective Disorder (SAD),
          brings us the most important work on Transcendental Meditation since
          the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's
          <i>Science of Being and Art of Living</i>-- and one of our
          generation's most significant books on achieving greater physical and
          mental health and wellness. <br /><br />
          <i>Transcendence</i> demystifies the practice and benefits of
          Transcendental Meditation for a general audience who may have heard
          about the method but do not necessarily know what it is, how it is
          learned, or what they stand to gain, physically and emotionally, from
          achieving transcendence. Dr. Rosenthal clearly and practically
          explains the basic ideas behind Transcendental Meditation: It is a
          nonreligious practice that involves sitting comfortably for twenty
          minutes twice a day while using a silent mantra, or nonverbal sound,
          to attain a profound state of aware relaxation. <br /><br />
          Alongside exclusive celebrity interviews-where figures like
          <b
            >Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Martin Scorsese, Russell Brand, Laura
            Dern, Moby</b
          >, and <b>David Lynch</b> openly discuss their meditation-Dr.
          Rosenthal draws upon experience from the lives of his patients and a
          wealth of clinical research amassed on TM over the past generation
          (340 peer-reviewed published articles). He provides the fullest and
          most accessible book ever on the broad range of benefits of this
          remarkably simple practice, from relief of anxiety, stress and
          depression to new hope for those experiencing addiction,
          attention-deficit disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

          "<b><i>Transcendence</i> </b>is a profoundly important book on a topic
          that you need to know a lot about... Dr. Rosenthal is one of those
          rare professionals who is able to mix authority and accuracy with
          riveting stories that read like a novel. In <b><i>Transcendence</i></b
          >, he has given us all a gift that will enlighten, entertain, and
          perhaps even transform. This will become the go-to book for those
          searching for the wisdom within meditation."<br />—<b

          read this book."<br />—<b>Candy Crowley, CNN anchor</b
          ><br /><br />“One of the striking features of this book is the
          empowering empathy with which Dr. Norman Rosenthal discusses the
          people with given health issues. It cannot but make the reader become
          more understanding of other humans and their anguish. In addition,
          there is all the neat science – explained simply yet not watered down
          to the degree of becoming trivial. Essentially, this is book about
          human condition in the modern world. But unlike the existentialists,
          Dr. Norman Rosenthal sees light at the end of the tunnel.”<br /><b

          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“The book makes a useful contribution to
          understanding the mind-body relationship in holistic ways, advancing
          ongoing dialogue among clinicians and just plain folks about how to
          live more healthfully.”<br /><b>—Publishers Weekly</b>
