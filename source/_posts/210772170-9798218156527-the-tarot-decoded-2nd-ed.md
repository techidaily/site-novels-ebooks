          "This book, The Tarot Decoded: Raziel's Interpretation, is
          revolutionary. I consider it to be the Tarot Bible for the Age of
          Aquarius, and at the same time a great instruction for how to
          integrate astrology with shadow work as a way to evolve spiritually
          and achieve enlightenment. The book unveils the correlations shared
          between Tarot &amp; biblical analogies conveyed with both Kabbalistic
          and Hermetic wisdom. Such Kabbalistic insights are drawn from the
          usage of the gematria hidden within the Rider-Waite deck. The book is
          truly mind-blowing!" - Doris Stovall

            need, but I would definitely say this is the only Rider-Waite book
            you need. I've learned more in one chapter of this book (Pisces)

          all the necessary correlations between Tarot, Kabbalah and other
          divination arts. Impressive work. It's not an easy book, one needs to
          have quite a good baggage of knowledge to properly understand it,
          however it's a very good starting point also, as it invites the reader
          to get deeper. I am highly recommending it." -Alex Surdea

            interested me. My copy arrived a few days ago, and I am totally
            captivated with the way Grant writes. In a few short pages, (65 to
            be precise, lol), he has revealed so much more than all the previous
            books I have read on the tarot. My previous readings about the Tree
            of Life and Kabbalah have prepared me well for this book. I am not
            sure that I could have followed the introduction as well, had I not
            had this prior knowledge. He repeats himself in ways that I find
            helpful, rather than annoying. These repetitive bits, refresh my
            memory while leading onward to new revelations. I can see myself
            reading this book through from cover-to-cover, which is unusual for
            me. I tend to dip into books, tire of them and lay them aside. I
            have a pencil, ruler and eraser handy next to me, to underline
            significant bits of information, and to write side notes in the
            margin. I am sure this book will become one I read and re-read. It
            is certainly NOT boring, but enthralling." - Janet Danes</span

            dig of the Ryder-Waite-Smith that leaves no stone unturned. I'm only
            halfway through the book at this point, and the revelations are
            jaw-dropping. Each chapter reveals hidden secrets in plain sight
            which deliver Divine Communications. Thank you Grant. You changed my
            ability to work with the tarot and caused a spiritual awakening." -
