            >“Working with spirits can be some of the most dangerous yet some of
            the most gratifying work a magickal practitioner can engage in. With
            Jason as your guide in this book, you are in some of the best hands
            out there when it comes to approaching and working with spirits.
            This is a book I wish I had fifteen years ago when I began working

          ><b>—Mat Auryn, author of&nbsp;<i>Psychic Witch</i></b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />Throughout history, humans have sought power and
          knowledge from spirits. Learning how to conjure, communicate, and
          negotiate with these unseen powers is one of the keys to success in
          magic.<br /><br /><b><i>Consorting with Spirits</i></b
          >&nbsp;presents a detailed explanation of what spirits are, their
          different classifications, and how they exist in relation to the world
          we normally perceive. The reader will then learn a system of practices
          that will cultivate three main skills: The capacity to perceive
          spirits clearly, the ability to interact with them effectively, and
          the tools to deepen your relationships. It is this focus on deepening
          relationships and increasing clarity in communications that has been
          missing from much of the material about spirits. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This
          book will teach you different ways of interacting with spirits, from
          offerings and invitations to forceful conjurations. With these tools
          in hand, you can work with your spirit allies to achieve any goal,
          from protection, to wealth, to vast knowledge.<br />&nbsp;<br /><b
            ><i>Consorting with Spirits</i></b

          with spirits.How to evaluate the messages you receive.A full view of
          different modes of contact and what situations each mode lends itself
          toWhy the best sorcery is local.The tools to establish and maintain a

          manifestations of spirits and their corresponding magickal operations,
