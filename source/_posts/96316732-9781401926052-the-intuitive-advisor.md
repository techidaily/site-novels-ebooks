            >Whether it’s the loveless marriage, family frustrations, the
            dead-end job, or all the other stressors that result in a health
            issue that won’t go away, most people have some prototypical problem
            that has caused them to get stuck in a rut and feel lost and
            confused. . . . And in just about every city or town, you can find a
            psychic advisor who will offer to advise you about these topics . .
            . often for a hefty sum of money. <br /></b
          ><br />But these types of "fortune tellers" give you only limited
          advice—more like a weather report. They tell you if things will get
          better or get worse, whether the boyfriend or girlfriend you just
          broke up with come back, whether that check you’ve been waiting for
          will be in the mail, or whether your loved one’s health will improve.
          All that’s left is for you to go home and wait for things to happen.
          Well, there must be a better way to learn how to deal with issues that
          affect your health . . . and there is! <br /><br />In this
          enlightening book, Mona Lisa Schulz, M.D., Ph.D., shows you how to
          combine intuition with intelligence to solve your most pressing health
          problems. But she’s not your run-of-the-mill intuitive. Described as a
          psychic doctor with humor, solutions, and credentials, Dr. Mona Lisa
          gives you no-nonsense, grounded, practical, in-your-face solutions on
          how to fix the relationship, or job/family/physical/emotional problem.
          <br /><br />She also explains how to deal with many ailments that
          affect your well-being, including fatigue, allergies, skin problems,
          weight, digestion, depression, anxiety, and much more. By mastering
          the "7 Rules for Intuitive Health," you can learn to intuitively
          conquer pain and suffering and create a life filled with health and
          happiness.

          provides a different perspective on challenging health issues. In her
          signature no-nonsense, humorous style, Dr. Mona Lisa guides the reader
          through a process of understanding his or her illness on an energetic
          level and then offers practical strategies to address each health
          problem. If you’re tired of tolerating pain and stress, you’ll want to
          use this book to learn a whole new way of welcoming health into your
          life.”<br /><b>— Cheryl Richardson</b>, the author of&nbsp;<i
            >The Art of Extreme Self-Care: Transform Your Life One Month at a
            Time</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>The Intuitive Advisor&nbsp;</i>is a magnificent,
          wise, bracing, and extremely helpful book. It puts anyone with
          goodwill in touch in the most sparkling way with their own powers of
          intuition. It is written with directness, hilarity, and savvy; and
          will have you sometimes laughing out loud and sometimes gasping for
          breath. I loved this book and recommend it heartily.”&nbsp;<br /><b

          >, the author of&nbsp;<i>The Hope:&nbsp;A Guide to Sacred Activism</i
          ><br /><br />“Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz is a rare genius. With stunning
          clarity and insight, she shows how health issues are guides to
          emotional healing. Brilliant, funny, and completely down to earth, she
          provides a chakra- based map of the human energy system with the power
          to evoke your best self and bring your body back to balance. This book
          is a must-read for every human being.”<br /><b

            Change</i
          ><br /><br />“Dr. Mona Lisa normalizes, simplifies, and helps you
          implement tools that can transform your body while entertaining the
          reader (helping the brain make all those good neurotransmitters) while
          doing it. She also makes the best cookie batter on the planet. From
          teenagers to those of us who remember when pong was the only video
          game on the market, Dr. Mona Lisa has a voice to reach everyone (and
          every cell)!”<br /><b>— Laura Day</b>, intuitive business consultant
          and best-selling author<br /><br />“Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz is an
          astoundingly accurate intuitive and a brilliant scientist who delivers
          lifesaving wisdom with twisted humor and a pop music score. You’ll be
          so entertained you may be amazed to realize how easily she has taught
          you to use your own intuition to solve your health problems.&nbsp;<i
