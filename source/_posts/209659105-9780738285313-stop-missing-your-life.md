            >Many of us live on autopilot, often so guarded that we don't
            experience the richness that life has to offer–so how can we find
            real happiness amid the chaos, so we don't reach the end of our life
            and feel like we missed it?</b
          ><br /><br />In <i>Stop Missing Your Life</i>, mindfulness teacher
          Cory Muscara takes us on a journey into the heart of what is required
          for real change, growth, and happiness. He exposes how the phrase "be
          present" has become little more than a platitude, imbued with the
          misguided message to be present just for the sake of being present,
          and reveals how to achieve true <i>Presence</i>: a quality of being
          that is unmistakably attractive about a person, and one that only
          comes when we've peeled back the layers of guarding that prevent us
          from being our full, honest, and integrated selves in the world.<br /><br />Muscara
          shows how we build internal walls, what he describes as a "Pain Box"
          inhibiting us from living a deeply connected and meaningful life. He
          offers a four-part FACE model (Focus, Allow, Curiosity, and
          Embodiment) that helps chip away at those walls and builds our
          capacity to experience the richness of our lives <i>Stop </i
          ><i>Missing Your Life</i> ultimately teaches how we can find peace in
          the chaos and become better people for our families, our communities,
          and our world.
