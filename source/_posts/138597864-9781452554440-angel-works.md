          Have you ever yearned to soar above a world of trouble? If so, prepare
          to fly! Barbara Anne Rose tells a true story of childhood joy dragged
          to earth by the weight of confusion, pain, and betrayal. But she gives
          wing to a spiritual journey and, a little at a time, recognizes the
          heavenly nature within herself and all of us. And she begins to soar,
          finding success, renewed happiness, the peace that comes from loving
          forgiveness, and her own inner divinity (with the help of a very
          special spirit-friend). How this worked for herand how it can work for
          youis now revealed in Angel Works. Richard D. SmithThis book is a

          later in life into the arms of a husband who was controlling and
          abusive. Truth, Love and forgiveness were what young Barbara was
          searching. Even though Barbara Anne Rose lived through such atrocities
          she was always a woman who has never given up on her dreams and in

          Truths. She writes in a way that is easily understood giving readers
