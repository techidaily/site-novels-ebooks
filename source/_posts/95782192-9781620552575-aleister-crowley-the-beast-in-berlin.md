          A biographical history of Aleister Crowley’s activities in Berlin from
          1930 to 1932 as Hitler was rising to power <br />
          <br />• Examines Crowley’s focus on his art, his work as a spy for
          British Intelligence, his colorful love life and sex magick exploits,
          and his contacts with magical orders <br />
          <br />• Explores Crowley’s relationships with Berlin’s artists,
          filmmakers, writers, and performers such as Christopher Isherwood,
          Jean Ross, and Aldous Huxley <br />
          <br />• Recounts the fates of Crowley’s friends and colleagues under
          the Nazis as well as what happened to Crowley’s lost art exhibition
          <br />
          <br />Gnostic poet, painter, writer, and magician Aleister Crowley
          arrived in Berlin on April 18, 1930. As prophet of his syncretic
          religion “Thelema,” he wanted to be among the leaders of art and
          thought, and Berlin, the liberated future-gazing metropolis, wanted
          him. There he would live, until his hurried departure on June 22,
          1932, as Hitler was rapidly rising to power and the black curtain of
          intolerance came down upon the city. <br />
          <br />Known to his friends affectionately as “The Beast,” Crowley saw
          the closing lights of Berlin’s artistic renaissance of the Weimar
          period when Berlin played host to many of the world’s most outstanding
          artists, writers, filmmakers, performers, composers, architects,
          philosophers, and scientists, including Albert Einstein, Bertolt
          Brecht, Ethel Mannin, Otto Dix, Aldous Huxley, Jean Ross, Christopher
          Isherwood, and many other luminaries of a glittering world soon to be
          trampled into the mud by the global bloodbath of World War II. <br />
          <br />Drawing on previously unpublished letters and diary material by
          Crowley, Tobias Churton examines Crowley’s years in Berlin and his
          intense focus on his art, his work as a spy for British Intelligence,
          his colorful love life and sex magick exploits, and his contacts with
          German Theosophy, Freemasonry, and magical orders. He recounts the
          fates of Crowley’s colleagues under the Nazis as well as what happened
          to Crowley’s lost art exhibition--six crates of paintings left behind
          in Germany as the Gestapo was closing in. Revealing the real Crowley
          long hidden from the historical record, Churton presents “the Beast”
          anew in all his ambiguous and, for some, terrifying glory, at a
          blazing, seminal moment in the history of the world.

        </h4>
        <p>
          “<i>The Beast in Berlin</i> is an inspiring and engaging narrative of
          Aleister Crowley in the turbulent and cathartic years of Berlin in the
          early 1930s. Meticulously researched and filled with just enough
          biographical fact, informed speculation, dirty gossip and esoteric
          philosophy to keep you riveted from first word to last, Crowleyan
          scholar Tobias Churton has spun an entertaining and eye-opening tale
          documenting the reckless life of outsider artists living on the edge
          in a city on the brink of Apocalypse. Along the way we see the Beast
          play chess with Fernando Pessoa, correspond with Aldous Huxley, night
          crawl with Christopher Isherwood, spy, paint, incant, exorcise and
          interact artistically and sexually with a wide range of colorful,
          bizarre and nondescript characters—the absolute dregs of Berlin
          society. Perhaps the most readable and interesting book to catch the
          true spirit of Frater Perdurabo.”
