              >A powerful new approach to natural, intuitive whole-body
              healing.</b
            ><br /><br /><i>The Body Code</i> is a truly revolutionary method of
            holistic healing. Dr. Bradley Nelson, a globally renowned expert in
            bioenergetic medicine, has spent decades teaching his powerful
            self-healing method and training practitioners around the globe, but
            this is the first time his system of healing will be available to
            the general public in the form of
            <i>The Body Code</i>.<br /><br /><i>The Body Code</i> is based on
            the simple premise that the body is self-healing and knows what it
            needs in order to thrive and flourish. The Body Code method allows
            readers to tap into this inner knowing, and find imbalances in 6 key
            areas—Energies, Circuits and Systems, Toxicity, Nutrition and
            Lifestyle, Misalignments, and Pathogens—that are the root causes of
            our physical, mental and emotional issues. By identifying and
            releasing these imbalances, readers become empowered to activate
            their body's innate healing power.<br /><br />Featuring a foreword
            from George Noory, host of <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>, and filled with
            powerful first-hand accounts of healing, hundreds of color
            illustrations, and concrete, actionable steps,
            <i>The Body Code</i> is a road map to healing based in deep study of
            the human body, time-proven ancient practices, and the unlimited
            power of the subconscious mind.

          "I read Dr. Bradley Nelson’s <i>Emotion Code</i> book several years
          ago and started using the information in it to help my patients,
          family and friends. Many of my experiences with The
          <i>Emotion Code</i> were amazing and quite beneficial for each of the
          recipients of that process. When Brad asked me to read his new book
          <i>The Body Code</i> and to write an endorsement, I gladly accepted.
          <i>The</i> <i>Emotion Code</i> was a very good book, but I think
          <i>The Body Code</i> is even better. I really like the methodical way
          that Dr. Nelson has presented the principles and practice of
          <i>The Body Code</i>. The many life-changing testimonials and case
          examples in <i>The Body Code</i> provide great encouragement and
          specific actionable examples for its readers. It is a book that, if
          the information in it is properly applied, can positively improve not
          only the reader’s life but also the lives of whoever the reader
          chooses to help using its information. I highly recommend
          <i>The Body Code</i>!" <br /><i>—William Lee Cowden MD, MD(H), </i
