            In his book, "Who Told You That?", Don delivers a profound, yet
            practical opportunity to stimulate and exterminate the covert
            operation of status quo thought. Within its pages, you will find a
            calculated provocation that encourages both intentional honesty and
            uninhibited transparency, while providing inspiration, information
            and insightful transformation. Through various snapshots of his life
            journey, Don passionately calls one's mind to attention, to
            participate and even perspire mentally, emotionally and spiritually
            in the pursuit of a new-found freedom from self-sabotage and
            ultimate defeat. Spring-boarding from that noteworthy inquiry of
            "validating the voices and qualifying your choices," HandCrafted
            Soul'utions provides a collection of "internal investigative" tools
            to identify the missing "WHOLE" in your soul.&nbsp;

          "Hand Crafted Soul'utions" is the perfect complement to his first
          volume, "Who Told You That?". As an answer naturally follows a
          question, so does this volume come to us as the "traveling companion"
          to his first offering to us the readers. Don gives to us the wakeup
          call that the missing solutions we seek can only truly be seized upon
          when we focus less on our rights and more upon our responsibilities.
          As you read and absorb the "hand tools" and "power tools" offered to
          you, you will inescapably come to three conclusions. First, Don Hand
          has personally been in deep conversation with the "Master Mentor" and
          under His tutelage. Second, the necessary work of heart will lead to a
          spiritual/mental internal investigation which will free you from the
          hindering encumbrance of a faith that has been quietly poisoned for
          perhaps, a great portion of your life. Third, your own personal,
          extended wilderness wandering (and all the aimlessness and frustration
          that go with it), reflect the missing "whole" in your own soul. Truth
          is, you will see how confronting yourself and making the necessary
          course corrections for your life will absolutely change your destiny!
          This book will both challenge and change you - for the
          best.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          Don has done it again.&nbsp;With the "ditches" in life at every
          corner, it is refreshing to find a detailed handbook on how to get
          "unstuck." This book is a ready guide to all of us as we go through
          the often perilous path of life.&nbsp;
