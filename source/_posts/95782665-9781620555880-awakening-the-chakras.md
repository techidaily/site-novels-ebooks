          An in-depth guide to understanding and balancing the chakras<br /><br />•
          Provides meditations, mantras, and other methods to work with each
          chakra<br /><br />• Details each chakra’s positive and negative
          qualities, their gifts and challenges, and how they interact with each
          other<br /><br />• Examines the psychological causes of blocked energy
          in the chakras<br /><br />• Shares chakra wisdom and profound
          spiritual insights from Sri Harish Johari, Guruji Pilot Baba, Mataji
          Narmada Puri, Sri Aurobindo, and other spiritual leaders
          <br /><br />By understanding the chakras, you can better understand
          the ways you interact with the world around you and the energetic
          roots of your inner being. Offering an in-depth guide to this powerful
          ancient yogic science, authors Victor Daniels, Kooch N. Daniels, and
          Pieter Weltevrede--all longtime students of the late tantric scholar,
          philosopher, and temple artist Sri Harish Johari--explain the essence
          of each of the 7 chakras and provide practical tools to work with
          these energetic “wheels of light.” <br /><br />Revealing how each
          chakra is connected with specific patterns of thinking, feeling,
          sensing, and acting, the authors explore how the chakras offer a
          vertical map of consciousness beginning with the root chakra at the
          base of the spine and ascending to the crown chakra on top of the
          head. They provide dynamic meditations, mantras, and other methods to
          work with the chakras. You will learn how to enhance each chakra’s
          positive features and transform the difficult ones. You will discover
          the complementary ways they affect each other, the gifts and strengths
          each can bestow, and the psychological causes of potential imbalances
          within them. Coauthor Pieter Weltevrede provides visual portrayals of
          traditional images of the chakras and their deities, explaining the
          spiritual secrets embedded in each. Sharing profound insights from
          their studies with Harish Johari, the authors also include chakra
          wisdom from other gurus they have studied with such as Guruji Pilot
          Baba and Mataji Narmada Puri.<br /><br />Offering practical wisdom for
          help in daily life and freedom from the tethers of your past, chakra
          work provides a powerful way to hear your inner self more deeply and a
          systematic path for activating higher levels of consciousness.

          indeed, a map for the attainment of Enlightenment. The authors’
          multilayered knowledge adds special color, resonance, and
