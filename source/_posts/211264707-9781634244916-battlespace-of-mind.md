          The Nazi's never surrendered and planned their 4th Reich using
          neurocognitive weapons. Going underground their technology made it's
          way to S. America, the Soviet Union, the United States, among other
          places. We all are bound by the new rules of corporate fascism, long
          planned by Himmler, and his main strategy for a 4th Reich, financial
          control. Are we all just living in a computer-controlled information
          battlespace continued from World War II? This book dissects the matrix
          of control used by advanced military industrial powers; it breaks down
          the technology bit by bit so you have an understanding how technology
          is being used in a battle for your mind. I address these issues from a
          veteran's insight as a former Signal Intelligence specialist and with
          some background in the Intelligence Community, I bring forth
          countermeasures to this control, showing you how you can safeguard
          your mind from these attacks. Countermeasures that are not available
          anywhere in the commercial world, yet without them you will be easy
          prey for these directed targeted pulse modulated attacks first used by
          the Nazis.
