            downloadable digital audio tracks offering Silvia's guidance through
            many of the exercises, here is a definitive resource for

          <b>Silvia Nakkach</b><br />An internationally known pioneer in the
          field of sound and transformation of consciousness, Silvia Nakkach,
          MA, MMT, has cultivated a voice that transports listeners into the
          heart of devotion. Her vocal work ranges from traditional chants to
          contemporary vocal improvisations. She is also an award-winning
          composer, former music psychotherapist, teacher, and recording
          artist.<br />Nakkach is the founding director of Vox Mundi School of
          the Voice, an international project devoted to teaching and preserving
          sacred-music traditions. Vox Mundi students study the integrative use
          of sound and chant to transform consciousness, to support healing, and
          to revitalize singing as spiritual practice. Vox Mundi has schools in
          the San Francisco Bay Area, Brazil, and Argentina.<br />Nakkach is on
          the faculty of the California Institute of Integral Studies in San
          Francisco, where she created the Sound, Voice, and Music Healing
          certificate and also designed the academic master’s degree in
          integrative health with a focus on sound healing. She travels
          worldwide to lead trainings in Yoga of the Voice, her signature
          program.<br />Nakkach’s interest in indigenous music cosmology and
          spirituality has led her to collaborate with renowned Indian healers
          and South American shamans. In addition, she has studied Hindustani
          music with the late maestro Ali Akbar Khan, and Dhrupad singing with
          Dr. Ritwik Sanyal in Benares, India, where she travels annually with
          her students.<br />Nakkach, who holds degrees in music composition,
          psychology, music therapy, and music education, has written an opera
          (<i>Amazonia Insight</i>), released nine albums, and written many
          scholarly articles on the healing power of music. Her album,
          <i>Ah: The Healing Voice</i>, is played in hospitals and health-care
          centers to create a healing atmosphere before and after surgery. She
          has contributed to an extensive body of therapeutic vocal techniques
          that have become landmarks in the fields of sound healing and music
          therapy training.<br /><br /><b>Valerie Carpenter</b><br />Valerie
          Carpenter is the founding director of The Vestibule Center for Sound
          Healing and cofounder of the Bay Area Sound Healing Alliance. She is a
