            ><i>A Course in Miracles</i>&nbsp;(ACIM)—the self-study
            spiritual-thought system that teaches the way to love and
            forgiveness—has captured the minds and hearts of millions of people,
            and delivered inner peace where fear and pain once prevailed.</b
          ><br /><br />Its universal message is unsurpassed in its power to
          heal. Yet many students report that they have difficulty grasping the
          principles, or encounter resistance to the lessons. So, even while
          they yearn for the spiritual freedom the Course offers, they put the
          book aside, hoping one day to get to it.<br /><br />Alan
          Cohen,&nbsp;<i>ACIM</i>&nbsp;student and teacher for over 30 years,
          takes the Big Picture ideas of the Course and brings them down to
          earth in practical, easy-to-understand lessons with plenty of
          real-life examples and applications.<br /><br /><i
            >A Course in Miracles Made Easy</i
          >&nbsp;is the Rosetta stone that will render the Course understandable
          and relatable; and, most importantly, generate practical, healing
          results in the lives of students. This unique reader-friendly guide
          will serve longtime students of the Course, as well as those seeking
          to acquaint themselves with the program.

          treat. Thanks, Alan!”<br />— <b>Tom Carpenter</b>, author of
          <i>Dialogue on Awakening<br /><br /></i>“For many, the impenetrability
          of <i>A Course in Miracles</i> is such that it might as well be
          written in a foreign language. Fortunately, books like this one exist.
          Coming from insight, heart, and joy,
          <i>A Course in Miracles Made Easy&nbsp;</i>is one of the best primers
          to ACIM I’ve ever read. Highly recommended.”<br />—
