          With the words, "Do not try to change people; they are only messengers
          telling you who you are. Revalue yourself and they will confirm the
          change," Goddard invites us to resist the temptation toward judgment
          and to look at ourselves for the change we want to see in the world an
          in others. Neville shows how change of consciousness is the critical
          factor in life, for consciousness is the only reality, the first and
          only cause-substance of the phenomena of life. Increase your
          mindfulness with ten easy exercises, devised by a prominent leader of
          the spiritual movement known as New Thought.<br />Neville Lancelot
          Goddard was born in Barbados in 1905. He came to the United States to
          study drama at the age of seventeen and whilst touring with his dance
          company in England he developed an interest in metaphysics after
          striking up a conversation with a Scotsman. The Scotsman lent him a
          series of books on the powers of the mind. On his return he gave up
          the entertainment industry to devote his full attention to the study
          of spiritual and mystical matters. After traveling extensively
          throughout the United States, Neville eventually made his home in Los
          Angeles where, in the 1950s, he gave a series of talks on television
          and radio, and for many years lectured regularly to capacity
          audiences. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he confined most of his
          lectures to Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. In his early
          lectures and books, Neville dealt solely with what he called The Law,
          the technique of creating one's physical reality through imagining. It
          is this portion of his expression that most closely accords with the
          teachings of the New Thought movement.
