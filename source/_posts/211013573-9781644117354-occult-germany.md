          • Examines the survival and revival of the old pre-Christian gods,
          investigates prehistoric sacred sites, and reveals ancient shamanic
          traditions<br /><br />• Looks at Rosicrucianism and the distinctive
          Germanic forms of astrology, alchemy, and the Kabbalah<br /><br />•
          Discusses German poets, philosophers, and mystics, such as Dr. Johann
          Faust, Wolfram von Eschenbach, Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen,
          and Jakob Boehme<br /><br />Recounting the longstanding magical
          tradition of Germany, Christopher McIntosh investigates the numerous
          prehistoric sacred sites that point to a nearly forgotten ancient
          shamanic civilization. He examines the survival and revival of the old
          pre- Christian gods in folklore, customs, and practices as well as
          witchcraft. He looks at Germany’s rich and many-faceted spiritual
          heritage and explores Christian mysticism and theosophy as exemplified
          by Meister Eckhart, Hildegard of Bingen, and Jakob Boehme.<br /><br />Examining
          Rosicrucianism, which originated in Germany, the author also looks at
          other secret societies that flourished in Germany, such as speculative
          Freemasonry, the Fraternitas Saturni, and the Golden and Rosy Cross.
          He explores how the Church sought to stamp out the old gods and pagan
          beliefs as well as how periods of the Church’s heaviest oppression
          produced immortal poets, philosophers, theologians, artists, and
          mystics.<br /><br />Exploring more recent centuries, the author looks
          at the Nordic revival in the 19th century and the influence of
          Theosophy and the movements that grew out of it, such as Steiner’s
          Anthroposophy. Examining the esoteric traditions of the 20th century,
          he looks at the work of neo-Nordic occultists and esoteric writers
          like Meyrink and Hesse. He explores certain occult aspects of the
          Third Reich, which resulted in a backlash against the occult.<br /><br />Revealing
          both the enlightened and the dark sides of occult Germany, the author
          shows how this country has long been a cauldron in which esoteric
          ideas have flourished, spread, and been lauded as well as condemned,
          leaving an enduring mark.
