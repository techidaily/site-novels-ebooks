          In 2010, Richard Merrick took a family trip to Scotland's Rosslyn
          chapel—the enigmatic fifteenth-century temple made famous by Dan
          Brown's <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. Little did he know he was about to
          embark upon an intellectual and personal journey that would lead to
          the discovery of a real-life lost symbol—one that reveals the
          connection between the world's most sacred temples and opens up a
          treasure trove of lost science and ancient secrets.<br /><br />
          The symbol he discovers—the Venus Blueprint—is based on that planet's
          orbital pattern, which takes the shape of a five-pointed star when
          seen from Earth. As Merrick digs deeper, he realizes the Venus
          Blueprint was an integral part of the design template of some of the
          most significant religious architecture around the world--including
          St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, the Roman Pantheon, the Greek
          Parthenon, the Temple of Jerusalem, and the Great Pyramid of Giza, as
          well as many buildings designed by the secretive Freemason society.<br /><br />
          Upon further examination, Merrick is astounded to discover that
          temples designed using the Venus Blueprint are endowed with
          extraordinary acoustics that, when supplied with the right tones and
          frequencies, are capable of harmonizing with Earth's resonant
          frequencies and evoking altered states of consciousness. He then
          proposes a fascinating idea: Could it be that the ancients used these
          harmonics to enhance entheogenically induced visions—to commune with
          the divine and liberate the gods within?<br /><br />
          Supported by an impressive array of historical research and scientific
          analysis, <i>The Venus Blueprint</i> offers compelling evidence of an
          ancient lost culture that was both spiritually and scientifically
          advanced.

          "An exciting new theory of sacred art, sacred architecture, and the

          "... a convincing case for a profound cosmic connection between
          Venus's orbital geometry and the architectural template underlying

          "Original and thought-provoking, <i>The Venus Blueprint</i> challenges

        </h4>
        <p>
          Richard Merrick is an award-winning pioneer in the high-tech industry,
          developing sound- and language-recognition systems, graphics and
          animation engines, and AI game engines designed to mirror and mimic
          human behavior. He retired in 2006 to further develop his theory of
          music perception, called harmonic interference theory. In addition to
          writing several books on topics related to harmonics, he has written
          for <i>Nexus</i> and <i>Caduceus</i> magazines and has spoken as a
          guest lecturer at Rosslyn chapel in Scotland.
