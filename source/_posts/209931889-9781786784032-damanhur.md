          Damanhur in Italy has for nearly 45 years been an experiment in human
          consciousness and in this fully illustrated book Jeff Merrifield
          outlines the exciting discoveries that the community is making.<br /><br />Short
          steps for humans, a giant leap for humankind. For more than four
          decades the spiritual-artistic community of Damanhur has grown from
          humble beginnings to become a prime mover in terms of spiritual
          research and the ecological protection of the planet.<br />A group of
          people which has remained a stable and active entity over all those
          years, they have developed a sociological tool to enhance their shared
          experiences, the concept of a Superindividual, where groups of people
          or even whole communities become as one, and&nbsp;function and create
          as one.<br />The best news is, Damanhur is opening out to the world.
          It will no longer be a closed and introspective collective, but will
          be sharing its discoveries with humanity at large. Already, groups of
          indigenous peoples are treading a path to Damanhur, sharing shamanic
          knowledge and forming mutual bonds on a mission to save the planet and
          make the world a better place.<br />An ambitious and exciting
          programme of new building has already started in and around the now
          famous&nbsp;<i>Temples of Humankind</i>. At the same time, Damanhur is
          going out into the world, establishing active centres around the
          globe, as far afield as Iceland and Australia, not as clones of the
          Italian version, but as thriving vibrant entities in their own
          right.<br />It's an inspiration to families, to workplaces, to other
          communities and to movements like Extinction Rebellion. How do we
          transform society from the ground up? How can we both flourish as
          individuals and work together in community for a common cause? This
          book will show you how.
