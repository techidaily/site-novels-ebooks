          <b>Dick Sutphen had two very distinct careers in his lifetime</b>. He
          studied art and became an Art Director and eventually opened his own
          studio in Scottsdale, Arizona. His second career was in Self-Help and
          Metaphysics. When he developed an interest in a subject, he would
          spend hours researching and developing his thoughts. He was introduced
          to hypnosis and past-life regression from an artist he employed who
          convinced him to go to have a past-life regression. That first
          regression took him to a time in ancient Mexico and the experience was
          so profound, his interest in his Art Studio began to take a back seat
          to metaphysics. He decided to turn part of his studio into a seminar
          room and began the Hypnosis Center so he could experiment with
          different ways to conduct hypnosis and past-life regressions. His
          Wednesday night sessions were very popular. Many of his students
          requested private sessions, which gave him an opportunity to do
          in-depth research and write about his discoveries. He developed his
          own style of hypnosis session, which he termed, Spirit Contact
          Therapy.<br /><br />Dick Sutphen was an amazing artist,
          Hypnotherapist, lecturer and writer. He left behind hundreds of
          columns and articles he wrote over the years. Wanting to carry out his
          wishes, his wife, Roberta organized his most important articles into
          the years in which he wrote them. This is the first time they have
          been published in a book.<br /><br />Dick was a Master who came here
          to enlighten and challenge us to become our authentic selves. You will
          find some wondrous ideas within these pages and be amazed how his
          wisdom still holds today as it did when he wrote these over the past
          five decades.
