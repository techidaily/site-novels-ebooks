          This insightful, easy-to-read handbook offers a non-traditional
          perspective on meditation. Written primarily for American insight
          meditation students, it delivers the Buddha's essential teachings
          clearly, straightforwardly, and without spiritual jargon, and helps
          make sense of practices often laden with traditional terminology.
          Practical explanations of the meditation process, its benefits and
          applicability to daily life, and warmly humorous advice and
          encouragement give new practitioners the help necessary to continue
          practicing meditation on a regular basis.

          "A wise, clear, and playfully irreverent account of a meditator’s
          journey. Patrick Ophuls speaks from experience as he points out the
          depth of the teachings and the seductions along the way."<br />—Joseph
          Goldstein, author of <i>One Dharma: The Emerging Western Buddhism</i
          ><br />
          <br />"Erudite, humorous, intelligent, deeply insightful, extremely
          well written, accurate, accessible.… I want all my sangha here to read
          it."<br />—Robert K. Hall, founding teacher of the Lomi School, Santa
          Rosa, California, and El Dharma retreat center, Todos Santos,
          Mexico<br />
          <br />"A good introduction for the beginner and a fresh perspective
          for the experienced practitioner. Alternately makes us laugh at
          ourselves and reminds us of the poignancy of the teachings."<br />—Sharon
          Salzberg, author of <i>A Heart as Wide as the World</i> <br />
          <br />"Ophuls gives us a no-nonsense, commonsense tour of
          mindfulness-based <i>meditation</i> practice, pointing out
          contradictions and pitfalls, and laughing at our pretentions. ... This
          book will help you swim to the other shore."<br />—Wes Nisker, editor
          in chief, <i>Inquiring Mind</i><br />
          <br />“Patrick Ophuls’ style is straight-forward and engaging. He
          doesn’t cut any corners, and he doesn’t fluff up his writing… [<i
            >Buddha Takes No Prisoners</i
          >
          is] approachable yet elevating… The book is like a FAQ for your
          Buddhist practice. I definitely recommend it.”<i
            ><br />—Home Brew Dharma<br /><br /></i
          >“Ophuls has done us all a favor by reframing meditation and the
          essentials of Buddhism in imaginative terms that are both appealing
          and edifying. Meditation, he says, is like spring-cleaning your heart
          and mind.”<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          Patrick Ophuls graduated in 1955 from Princeton University with a
          degree in Near Eastern area studies and obtained a PhD from Yale in
          political science in 1973. He joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1959,
          was a political analyst on the Afghanistan desk at the State
          Department, and was also posted to American embassies in Abidjan,
          Ivory Coast, and Tokyo, Japan, as a personal aide to two ambassadors.
          Leaving the Foreign Service in 1967, he became a professor of
          political science at Northwestern University. Patrick Ophuls has
          practiced insight meditation intensively for over 30 years. He began
          sitting with the Thai teacher Dhiravamsa in 1974, graduating from his
          teacher training program in 1977 and going on to assist him during
          several retreats in 1978. He began studying with Insight Meditation
          Society founders Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg
          in the late seventies, an association that continues to this day.Jack
          Kornfield was trained as a Buddhist monk in Thailand, Burma and India.
          Kornfield has become one of the key teachers to introduce Theravada
          Buddhist practice to the West. For many years his work has focused on
          integrating and bringing alive the great Eastern spiritual teachings
          in an accessible way for Western students and Western society. His
          books, audio tapes, and teachings have acted as an inspiration for
          countless Western students of Buddhism. His books include the
          bestselling <i>A Path With Heart</i> and
          <i>After the Ecstasy, the Laundry. </i>Jack Kornfield holds a Ph.D. in
          clinical psychology. He is also a founding teacher of the Spirit Rock
          Center in Woodacre, California, where he currently lives and teaches.
