              >This epic study unveils the esoteric masters who have covertly
              impacted the intellectual development of the West, from Pythagoras
              and Zoroaster to the little-known modern icons Jean Gebser and
              Schwaller de Lubicz.</b
            ><br /><br />
            Running alongside the mainstream of Western intellectual history
            there is another current which, in a very real sense, should take
            pride of place, but which for the last few centuries has occupied a
            shadowy, inferior position, somewhere underground.<br /><br />
            This "other" stream forms the subject of Gary Lachman’s epic history
            and analysis, <b><i>The Secret Teachers of the Western World</i>.</b
            ><br /><br />
            In this clarifying, accessible, and fascinating study, the acclaimed
            historian explores the Western esoteric tradition – a thought
            movement with ancient roots and modern expressions, which, in a
            broad sense, regards the cosmos as a living, spiritual, meaningful
            being and humankind as having a unique obligation and responsibility
            in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The historical roots of our “counter tradition,” as Lachman
            explores, have their beginning in Alexandria around the time of
            Christ. It was then that we find the first written accounts of the
            ancient tradition, which had earlier been passed on orally. Here, in
            this remarkable city, filled with teachers, philosophers, and
            mystics from Egypt, Greece, Asia, and other parts of the world, in a
            multi-cultural, multi-faith, and pluralistic society, a synthesis
            took place, a creative blending of different ideas and visions,
            which gave the hidden tradition the eclectic character it retains
            today.<br /><br />
            The history of our esoteric tradition roughly forms three parts:<br />
            &nbsp;<br />
            <b>Part One</b>: After looking back at the earliest roots of the
            esoteric tradition in ancient Egypt and Greece, the historical
            narrative opens in Alexandria in the first centuries of the
            Christian era. Over the following centuries, it&nbsp;traces our
            “other” tradition through such agents as the Hermeticists;
            Kabbalists; Gnostics; Neoplatonists; and early Church fathers, among
            many others. &nbsp;We examine the reemergence of the lost Hermetic
            books in the Renaissance and their influence on the emerging modern
            mind.<br /><br />
            <b>Part Two</b> begins with the fall of Hermeticism in the late
            Renaissance and the beginning of “the esoteric counterculture.” In
            1614, the same year that the Hermetic teachings fell from grace, a
            strange document appeared in Kassel, Germany announcing the
            existence of a mysterious fraternity: the Rosicrucians. Part two
            charts the impact of the Rosicrucians and the esoteric currents that
            followed, such as the Romance movement and the European occult
            revival of the late nineteenth&nbsp;century, including Madame
            Blavatsky and the opening of the western mind to the wisdom of the
            East, and the fin-de-siècle occultism of the Hermetic Order of the
            Golden Dawn.<br /><br />
            <b>Part Three</b> chronicles the rise of “modern esotericism,” as
            seen in the influence of Rudolf Steiner, Gurdjieff, Annie Besant,
            Krishnamurti, Aleister Crowley, R. A Schwaller de Lubicz, and many
            others. Central is the life and work of C.G. Jung, perhaps the most
            important figure in the development of modern spirituality. The book
            looks at the occult revival of the “mystic sixties” and our own New
            Age, and how this itself has given birth to a more critical,
            rigorous investigation of the ancient wisdom.<br /><br />
            With many detours and dead ends, we now seem to be slowly moving
            into a watershed. It has become clear that the dominant, left-brain,
            reductionist view, once so liberating and exciting, has run out of
            steam, and the promise of that much-sought-after “paradigm change”
            seems possible. We may be on the brink of a culminating moment of
            the esoteric intellectual tradition of the West.

          "It is no mean feat to make good sense of the Arcana and to cast light
          on the occult, but Lachman has pulled it off with this most engaging

          ambitious undertaking most successfully completed." <br />--<b

          “Gary Lachman spoils his readers -- after encountering his prose you
          will find no other writing on esoteric and occult subjects that
          displays such fluidity, vibrancy, and gentle but assertive purpose. .

          “Gary Lachman has become an increasingly prolific engine of literate,

          --<b>Erik Davis, author of <i>TechGnosis</i></b
          ><br /><br />
          “Thinking outside the box, Lachman challenges many contemporary
          theories by reinserting a sense of the spiritual back into the

          “Gary Lachman presents the Western esoteric tradition as a richly
          detailed parade of characters, seething with political ambitions,
          follies, even infamy. He teaches by example that to understand their
          psychology and historical contexts is far more useful than moralizing
          or partisan reactions.”<br />

          “The invisible Rosicrucian brothers of the seventeenth century, the
          ‘Unknown Superiors’ of high-grade Freemasons, French utopian
          occultists, and Traditionalists of the twentieth century trace a
          continuous tradition of esoteric idealism applied to political
          thinking. Gary Lachman offers a panoramic spectacle of occultists and
          millenarian visionaries who seek to translate an absolute gnosis into
          a radical program of regeneration.”<br />
