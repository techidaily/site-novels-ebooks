            Kim Dawson Hodson is an occupational therapist, mother of six,
            grandmother of four, widow, author, farmer, and animal lover. She
            has lived on the Big Island of Hawaii for 32 years and a little farm
            with miniature goats, chickens, dogs, cats, a rabbit, and two rescue
            potbellied pigs, and one rescue sheep. She is also back in school,
            getting her certification as an animal-assisted therapist. She has
            been on a long journey for the past seven years. This journey has
            been one of painful loss, almost insurmountable grief, coupled with
            healing and new self-discovery. The healing began when she started
            to listen to the subtle "promptings" or "gut feelings." As she began
            to listen to these, she had a deep realization that they are truly a
            gift providing her with hope. She has had many adventures--large and
            small--ranging from life and death to saving an animal who is in
            trouble to witnessing the amazing birth of an animal on her farm.
            It's as if these "promptings" are bread crumbs to guide her through
            this thing called life. As she continued on this journey, she knew
            that she needed to share her true life miracle stories, so she began
            to write them down. As she started to write them, she began to learn
            even more about how to really "look" and "listen" to the
            "promptings" or "gut feelings." These signs are all around us. She
            has written this book to bring a message of hope to everyone who
            reads it, and maybe, just maybe, can learn to hear the "promptings"
            too.
