            >Discover the life, work, and magic of Pamela Colman Smith, the
            visionary artist behind the Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot Deck, the most
            popular and renowned divination deck in the world.&nbsp;</b
          ><br /><br />With rich imagery, stunning colors, and an iconic place
          in the realm of divination, the Rider-Waite Tarot is perhaps the best
          known deck in the world. Seasoned readers and fledgling diviners alike
          turn to these cards in search of inspiration, understanding, and even
          a hint at the future. But the story of their origin is less well
          known, with their brilliant creator's name stripped away from them for
          decades. Now, for the first time, mystics, art-lovers, and
          fortune-tellers will uncover the magical story of Pamela Coleman
          Smith, rendered in full-color illustrations by artist Cat Willett, and
          inspired by the work of Pamela herself.&nbsp;<br /><br />From a
          childhood spent between the United Kingdom and Jamaica, to early
          artistic success in New York, to involvement in the secret occult
          society Order of the Golden Dawn, Pamela -- or Pixie, as she was known
          to many -- had a life full of enchanted inspiration and profound
          hardship. Through it all, her art acted as a guiding force,
          culminating in her custom illustrations for the deck that would become
          the Rider-Waite Tarot. Though she received little money and almost no
          credit for her contributions to the magical realm in her lifetime,
          Pixie's impact on tarot, divination, and the worlds of mysticism and
          the arts have reverberated for nearly 150 years, and her story serves
          as an enchanted spark. Depicted in whimsical, full-color detail, with
          interludes tying Pamela to the resurgence of modern magic and the
          world of tarot throughout, this singular work is a must-read
          for&nbsp;witches, creatives, and activists.

        <p>
          <b>Cat Willett </b>is a Brooklyn-based artist and author who holds an
          MFA in Illustration from the Fashion Institute of Technology. She
