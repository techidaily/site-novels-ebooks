            >“The gift of Eva Pierrakos’s Pathwork&nbsp;has been with me for
            twenty years. It is the deepest and most effective spiritual work I
            have found, and it has helped me realize my dreams. Each time I read
            it, I am amazed at the depth and breadth of wisdom and love it
            teaches. It is a practical way of truth that will change your
            life.”—Barbara Ann Brennan, author of
            <i>Hands of Light<br /><br /></i></b
          >For more than twenty years, Eva Pierrakos was the channel for a
          spirit entity known only as the Guide. Combining rare psychological
          insight with an inspiring&nbsp; ision of human possibility, the
          Guide's teachings, known as the Pathwork, have influenced many key New
          Age thinkers who have studied at Pathwork centers in the United States
          and abroad. Now, the core teachings of the guide have been collected
          in one volume synthesizing the essential wisdom of the Pathwork.<br /><br />Under
          such headings as&nbsp;“The Idealized Self-Image,”&nbsp;“The Forces of
          Love, Eros, and Sex,”&nbsp;“Emotional Growth and Its
          Function,”&nbsp;“Real and False Needs,” and “The Spiritual Meaning of
          Crisis,” the Pathwork outlines the entire process of personal
          spiritual development. Unlike many over-idealized philosophies, the
          Pathwork confronts our devils as well as our anges, our all-too-human
          failings and petty ego concerns as well as our divine strengths. It
          shows us how to accept ourselves fully as we are now, and then ot move
          beyond the negativity, or&nbsp;“lower self,” that blocks our personal
          and spiritual evolution. It offers a practical, rational, and honest
          way to reach our deepest creative identity.<br /><br /><b
            >“I would advise that this book be read with a willingness to take
            time to digest what the Guide says. This is not ‘light’ reading,
            thought it is Light reading, I assure you. I find an enormous
            compatibility between these lectures and Emmanuel's teachings. What
            a wonderful gift to a wonderful world.”—Pat Rodegast, author of
            <i>Emmanuel’s Book</i></b

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Eva Pierrakos&nbsp;</b>was born Eva Wassermann in Austria in 1915.
          She grew up in Vienna during the political unrest of the post–World
          War I years while the darkness that was about to descend and culminate
          in World War II was gathering over Europe. However, Eva loved life,
          nature, animals, the pleasures of dancing and skiing and of
          friendship. She was able to leave Austria and lived for a while in
          Switzerland before settling down in New York. During this time she
          became the channel for a highly developed spirit guide who gave the
          series of lectures from which this volume was compiled. Hers is the
          perennial story of transmitters of spiritual truth: first,
          astonishment at the manifestation of the gift, then reluctance to
          accepting it, finally, humbly taking on the task with total
          commitment. Quietly, she drew to herself an ever-growing number of
          people who became attracted to the path of self-transformation taught
          by the Guide. From the materials of these lectures Eva Pierrakos
          developed&nbsp;<i>The Pathwork</i>, a psychological method which leads
          to the Godself through facing and transforming the lower self.Eva died
          in 1979, leaving behind her the rich legacy of 258 Guide lectures, two
          flourishing Pathwork centers, and thousands of students and followers
          of the teachings which she transmitted with such devotion for
          twenty-five years.
