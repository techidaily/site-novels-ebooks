            >In this compelling exploration of life, Gregg Braden merges the
            modern discoveries of nature’s patterns (fractals) with the ancient
            view of a cyclic universe. The result is a powerful model of
            time—fractal time—and a realistic window into what we can expect for
            the mysterious year 2012 . . .&nbsp;and beyond.</b
          ><br /><br />Applying fractal time to the history of the world and
          life, he proposes that everything from the war and peace between
          nations to the patterns of human relationships mirror the returning
          cycles of our past. As each cycle repeats, it carries a more powerful,
          amplified version of itself.<br /><br />The key: If you know where to
          look in the past,you know what to expect when the same conditions
          return in the present and future. For the first time in print, the
          Time Code Calculator gives you the toolto do just that!
          <br /><br />Through easy-to-understand science and step-by-step
          instructions, discover for yourself:<br /><br />• How the conditions
          for 2012 have occurred in the past, and what we can expect when they
          repeat!<br />• The “hot dates” that hold the greatest threats of war
          and greatest opportunities for peace, as well as economic cycles such
          as the stockmarket collapse of 2008!<br />• How Earth’s location in
          space triggers cycles of spiritual growth for humans!<br />• Your
          personal Time Codes for the key events of business, relationships, and
          change in your life!<br />• How each cycle carries a window of
          opportunity—a choice point—that allows us to select a new outcome for
          the returning pattern!<br />• What the 1999 ice cores from Antarctica
          reveal about past cycles of climate, global warming, Earth’s
          protective magnetic fields, and what these things mean for us today!

        </h4>
        <p>
          New York Times best selling author Gregg Braden is internationally
          renowned as a pioneer in bridging science and spirituality. Following
          a successful career as a Computer Geologist for Phillips Petroleum
          during the 1970s energy crisis, he worked as a Senior Computer Systems
          Designer with Martin Marietta during the last years of the Cold War.
          In 1991 he became The First Technical Operations Manager for Cisco
          Systems, where he led the development of the global support team
          assuring the reliability of the internet in its early days.For more
          than 22 years, Gregg has searched high mountain villages, remote
          monasteries, and forgotten texts to uncover their timeless secrets. To
          date, his work has led to such paradigm-shattering books as The Isaiah
          Effect, The God Code, The Divine Matrix, and his most recent, Fractal
          Time: The Secret of 2012 and a New World Age.Gregg’s work has been
          published in 27 languages and 30 countries and shows us beyond any
          reasonable doubt that the key to our future lies in the wisdom of our
          past.
