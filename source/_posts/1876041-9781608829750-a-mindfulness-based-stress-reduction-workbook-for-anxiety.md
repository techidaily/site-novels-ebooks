          If you have anxiety or suffer from panic attacks, little things like
          driving, being at a party where you don’t know anyone, or even going
          to the grocery store can seem overwhelming. But these little things
          are a part of everyday life, and if you try to avoid them, you may end
          up feeling alienated, lonely, and unfulfilled. Furthermore, simply
          avoiding anxiety-causing situations will not help you to conquer your
          anxiety. If anything, it can make it worse! So how can you take
          control of your anxiety symptoms, once and for all?&nbsp;In The
          Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Workbook for Anxiety, three
          mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) experts provide mindfulness
          meditations and exercises to help sooth anxiety, understand common
          triggers, and live more fully in the moment. Developed by Jon
          Kabat-Zinn, MBSR is a powerful, evidence-based treatment model that
          fuses mindfulness meditation and yoga, and has been proven effective
          in treating a wide range of chronic disorders and diseases. The
          mindfulness practices in MBSR help you to cultivate a greater
          awareness of the connection between your body and mind, and can help
          you identify and move past the toxic thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
          that lie at the root of your anxiety.&nbsp;If you are ready to take
          the first step toward managing your fears, anxiety, and worry, this
          book can help show you the way.

          “Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is currently the gold
          standard of mindfulness training, and this workbook [features] the
          essentials of MBSR written entirely for the anxious person. It’s like
          having the finest MBSR teachers speaking personally with you and
          guiding you on the path to emotional freedom.&nbsp;The course material
          is presented in a gentle, easy-to-read, carefully sequenced manner. If
          you follow along closely—using the downloadable guided meditations for
          support—your life will surely change for the better.&nbsp; I highly
          recommend this book for anyone who struggles with anxiety.”<br /><strong
