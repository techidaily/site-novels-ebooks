          From the outset, Hynek and Vallee make their position clear: UFOs
          represent an unknown but real phenomenon. The far-reaching
          implications take us to the very edge of what we consider known and
          real in our physical environment. Perhaps, say the authors, UFOs
          signal the existence of a domain of nature as yet totally
          unexplored.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In this mind-stretching book, the authors sample UFO reports,
          including those allegedly involving humanoids, and describe the
          perceived patterns in the behavior of the phenomenon. They also
          establish a framework for further study. Where might such study lead?
          What can be studied, and how? What is the real nature of the UFO
          phenomenon? Does it originate with the actions of other intelligences
          in the universe? If so, where and what might they be? Does the UFO
          phenomenon have a purely physical explanation, or is there a vast,
          hidden realm that holds the solution?<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In this invaluable work, we gain insight into the thinking of Hynek
          and Vallee’s research and investigations into UFOs, including Project
          Blue Book, the Pascagoula case, and the Betty and Barney Hill
          experience

        </h4>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          <b>Dr. J. Allen Hynek </b>(1910–1986) served as official astronomical
          consultant to the US Air Force’s Project Blue Book. He was an
          astronomer and professor of astronomy at Ohio State University and,
          later, chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University
          in Chicago. He is widely considered the father of the concept of
          scientific analysis both of reports and especially of trace evidence
          purportedly left by UFOs. His books include
          <i>The UFO Experience </i>and <i>The Hynek UFO Report</i>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><b>Dr. Jacques Vallee </b>has long been regarded as the
          most respected and senior scientific investigator of unidentified
          aerial phenomena (UAP). In 1962, he began working as an astronomer at
          the University of Texas at Austin, where he codeveloped the first
          computer-based detailed map of Mars for NASA. He went on to work for
          Hynek and Project Blue Book to create the first interactive computer
          database of UFO observations. He also worked as a member of the
          scientific advisory board of Bigelow Aerospace and conducted private
          research for Bigelow and its partners, including the Pentagon’s now
          declassified UAP program known as AATIP.<br /><br /><b>Paul Hynek</b>
          is a Wharton MBA, an Adjunct Professor of Finance and Accounting at
          Pepperdine University, and the creator of startup financial
          projections software that has raised over $1 billion for thousands and
          startups. Paul works with numerous startups as either a Board member,
          advisor, or part-time CFO. He was also consultant on The History
          Channel's “Project Blue Book” show. He is the son of J. Allen Hynek.
