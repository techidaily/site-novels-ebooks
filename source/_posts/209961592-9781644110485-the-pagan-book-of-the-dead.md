          An extensive look at the cartography and folklore of the afterlife
          worlds as seen by our ancestors <br /><br />• Examines how ancient
          European cultures viewed the beyond, including the Blessed Isles of
          early Greek and Celtic faith, the Hebrew <i>Sheol</i>, Hades from
          Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i>, Hel and Valhalla of the Norse, and the Aralu
          of Babylon <br /><br />• Shows how medieval accounts of journeys into
          the Other World represent the first recorded near-death experiences
          <br /><br />• Connects medieval afterlife beliefs and NDE narratives
          with shamanism, looking in particular at psychopomps, power animals,
          the double, the fetch, and what people bring back from their journeys
          to the spirit realms <br /><br />Charting the evolution of afterlife
          beliefs in both pagan and medieval Christian times, Claude Lecouteux
          offers an extensive look at the cartography and folklore of the
          afterlife worlds as seen by our ancestors. Exploring the locations and
          topographies of the various forms taken by Hell, Purgatory, and
          Heaven, he examines how ancient European cultures viewed the beyond,
          including the Blessed Isles of early Greek and Celtic faith, the
          Hebrew <i>Sheol</i>, the pale world of Hades from Homer’s
          <i>Odyssey</i>, Hel and Valhalla of the Norse, and the Aralu of
          Babylon, the land where nothing can be seen. The author also explores
          beliefs in Other Worlds, lands different from our own that are not the
          afterlife but places where time flows differently and which are
          inhabited by fantastic or supernatural beings such as fairies or
          dwarfs. <br /><br />Sharing medieval tales of journeys into the
          beyond, Lecouteux shows how these accounts represent the first
          recorded near-death experiences (NDEs) and examines how they compare
          with modern NDE narratives as well as the work of NDE researchers like
          Raymond Moody. In addition, he also explores tales of out-of-body
          experiences, dream journeys, and travels made by a double or fetch and
          connects these narratives with shamanism, looking in particular at
          psychopomps, power animals, and what people bring back from their
          journeys to the spirit realms. <br /><br />Analyzing the afterlife
          beliefs of the Middle Ages as a whole, Lecouteux concludes with a
          collection of medieval afterlife-related traditions, such as placing
          polished stones in the coffin so the departed soul can find its way
          back to friends and family at those times of the year when the veil
          between the worlds grows thin.
