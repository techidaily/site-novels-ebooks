          The Whole Elephant Revealed offers clear insights into the existence
          and operation of universal laws and the golden ratio. It is a
          synthesis based on common insights found in all wisdom traditions into
          the operation of universal laws on the one hand and on cutting-edge
          scientific discoveries that are in line with those insights on the
          other hand. These principles are called universal because they work on
          all levels of existence, apply to everything that exist and create
          order and harmony in the universe. Insights into the operation of the
          universal laws reveals a whole new worldview. It helps us to
          understand how everything works in the universe, who we really are and
          how we can make conscious choices that are more in line with these
          universal laws. Above all it helps us to understand what works and
          what doesn’t work in the long term. Everything that operates in line
          with the universal laws, follows the path of least resistance and is
          in harmony with the greater whole. It makes us realize that while
          everything in the universe works in harmony with these principles,
          many aspects of our personal life and our Western culture are not in
          line with the operation of these underlying principles. If we choose
          to act in line with the operation of the universal laws, it will go
          easier, will be more in tune with who we really are and more in
          harmony with the greater whole. This choice is hard to make though, if
          we don’t know those principles. For that reason the rediscovery of the
          working of these principles seems to be of extreme importance. In this
          time of great changes and global unbalance a growing number of people
          begin to feel the need for a clear and well-founded insight into the
          universal laws, because this gives an understanding of what is needed
          to restore the balance and harmony in ourselves as well as worldwide.
          Because the nature of these principles is universal, they apply to all
          aspects of our individual and social life. Therefore they can be used
          as a frame of reference for all personal and social transformations
          which aim at a greater harmony within ourselves and with the greater
          whole.<br />, <br />
