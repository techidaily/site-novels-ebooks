          Reveals a structured mind-body system for cultivating effortless
          action and intelligent spontaneity for peak performance <br /><br />•
          Details 4 fundamental habits and routines that are essential for
          developing peak performance and explains how to incorporate them into
          daily life <br /><br />• Explains the cognitive science behind the
          development of expert skills and how the teachings of ancient Eastern
          sages align with these scientific findings <br /><br />• Offers
          practices for cultivating physical and mental intelligence, fasting
          the mind, and harnessing creativity to achieve your desires
          <br /><br />Integrating the wisdom of the ancient sages with modern
          science, Jason Gregory explains how world-class artists and athletes
          reach peak performance--and how you, too, can harness this “lifestyle
          technology” to make your actions effortless, enjoy intelligent
          spontaneity, and reach optimal performance at a peak level. Drawing on
          modern cognitive science, Gregory explains dual process theory, which
          divides mental activity into two spheres: cold cognition, analogous
          with rational thought, and hot cognition, based on emotional
          intuition--a theory anticipated by ancient Eastern thought, especially
          the teachings of the Chinese sages. The author explains that peak
          performance is impossible to achieve by relying solely on cold
          cognition as it cuts you off from the energy reserves necessary to
          excel. He shows how the athletic concept of being “in the zone” is
          based on practices that have become energized by hot cognition and
          thus instinctive. <br /><br />Outlining a structured training system
          that blends hot and cold cognition, the author identifies four
          fundamental habits and routines that lay the foundation for a healthy
          embodied mind and mindful body and thus are essential for developing
          peak performance and success. He explains how these training methods
          are practical applications of ancient wisdom from Zen and Taoist
          traditions, such as wu-wei, as well as how they are supported by
          recent medical research. Building on the four fundamentals, he offers
          practices for cultivating physical and mental intelligence, fasting
          the mind, and harnessing creativity to achieve your desires.
          <br /><br />Gregory explains how, with regular practice, we can use
          the four fundamentals to create masterpiece days. And, as the
          masterpiece days compound, you build an unstoppable momentum where
          success is inevitable.
