          A guide to connecting with the wisdom and energies of ancient Africa
          and awakening the lion-hearted spiritual warrior within <br /><br />•
          Reveals the wisdom and love of the White Lions of Timbavati, who have
          returned to help us remember our divine origins <br /><br />• Explores
          how to reconnect to our original roots in Africa hidden deep within
          our DNA and remember our sacred contract to guard and protect the
          natural world <br /><br />• Offers shamanic journeys to connect with
          African power animals as well as the energetic hologram of the 31st
          meridian, the spine of Mother Earth <br /><br />It was predicted by
          indigenous tribes in Africa that when the White Lions return to their
          sacred lands in Timbavati we would be in a time of evolutionary and
          spiritual awakening. On Christmas Day in the year 2000, Marah the
          White Lion was born, the first “way-shower” to arrive and help us
          awaken to our divine origins, when we were one with all life in Zep
          Tepi, the land of first time. Our spiritual warrior selves are being
          summoned to heal the separation between us and nature, to be the
          change agents of heart, as we evolve to a higher consciousness.
          <br /><br />Exploring how to awaken to the energies and messengers of
          ancient Africa that reside along the 31st meridian, the spine of
          Mother Earth, Carley Mattimore and Linda Star Wolf take you on a
          journey to connect with our original roots in Africa, hidden deep
          within our DNA. They share shamanic journeys and teachings to connect
          with the strengths of Africa’s spirit animals, including the inner
          authority and heart of Lion, the loyalty and wisdom of Elephant, the
          love and compassion of Giraffe, and the shadow side of Hyena. They
          explore the power of shamanic sacred sites and offer teachings on the
          African Tree of Life and the energetic hologram of the 31st meridian.
          Sharing wisdom from Mhondoro Mandaza Kandemwa, Grandmother Twylah
          Nitsch, and other wisdom keepers, the authors explain how, as we
          connect with the messengers along the 31st meridian, we begin to
          remember our sacred contract to protect the natural world.
          <br /><br />Offering a guide to reconnect with the ancient African
          wisdom of love and higher consciousness buried in our cellular memory,
          the authors show how we can help reopen the heart of humanity and heal
          the world around us.

          “<i>Sacred Messengers of Shamanic Africa</i> offers a rich tableau of
          personal healing, access to archetypal lion wisdom, and guided
          journeys, all this while visiting significant and relatively unknown
          sacred sites in the cradle of early human evolution. As you travel
          along the golden meridian of South Africa, you return to your origin
          to end separation from nature. Highly recommended!”
