          An innovative, spiritual workbook that integrates the Tarot and the
          Kabbalistic tradition of Counting the Omer <br /><br />• Explores the
          origins and meaning of the 49-day Kabbalistic meditative practice of
          Counting the Omer and how it can lead to spiritual revelation,
          personal insight, and connection with the Divine <br /><br />• Reveals
          the correspondence of the Tarot’s minor arcana with the Sephirot of
          the Tree of Life and explains how both relate to the Omer meditation
          <br /><br />• Provides a daily practice workbook that explores the
          related Sephirot and Tarot cards for each day, examines their
          Kabbalistic and spiritual meanings, and provides questions for daily
          reflection and meditation guidance <br /><br />The 49-day mystical
          practice known as Counting the Omer is an ancient Jewish ritual
          observed between the holidays of Passover and Shavuot (also known as
          Pentecost). As practiced by Kabbalists, it is designed to cleanse and
          purify the soul in preparation for spiritual revelation and a personal
          connection with God. The ritual creates a spiritual inner journey that
          follows the path of the ancient Israelites from the moment of their
          physical freedom from slavery in Egypt to the establishment of their
          spiritual freedom forty-nine days later when they arrived at Mt.
          Sinai. <br /><br />Adeptly integrating this mystical practice with the
          transformative symbolism of the Tarot, Mark Horn uses the ritual of
          Counting the Omer as a template for a guided meditative practice that
          gives readers insight into their personal life journey and help in
          overcoming the issues that hinder their growth and spiritual
          awakening. Examining the correspondence of the Tarot’s minor arcana
          with the Sephirot of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, he shows how using
          the cards in connection with Counting the Omer can unlock the gates to
          a deep experience of the sacred. In the detailed daily practice
          workbook section, Horn provides day-by-day descriptions of the 49-day
          meditative practice of Counting the Omer. He divides the journey into
          seven week-long segments, which in turn are broken down into seven
          daily practices. For each day, he explains the related Sephirot and
          Tarot cards and their Kabbalistic and spiritual meanings, providing
          the reader with questions for daily reflection, guidance for
          meditation, and insight from traditional Jewish texts as well as
          teachings from Christian, Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim traditions.
          <br /><br />Unveiling the relationship between Tarot and the Kabbalah,
          Horn shows readers how uniting these two practices can open them to a
          deeper experience of the Divine.

          “Offers a spiritual practice for self-transformation, based on the
          tarot and the mystical practice of counting the 49 days prior to the
          revelation holiday of Shavuot/Pentecost. For each of the 49 days, Horn
          offers a combination of tarot cards as a meditative opening to growth
          and self-knowledge. Horn’s work displays a deep appreciation of tarot
          as a language for the soul and applies that language to a mystical
          technology for daily transformation. His book will appeal to diviners
          and spiritual seekers, Kabbalists and New Age practitioners. The
          practice laid out in this book is openhearted and challenging,
          ecumenical and ethically astute. It has the potential to set us on the
          path to enlightenment.”
