            George R. Noory is the host of America's top late-night radio talk
            show, <i>Coast to Coast AM</i>, which is broadcast to more than 500
            radio stations in the U.S. and Canada and streamed over the Internet
            to more than ten million people, five nights a week. Noory truly
            believes that there are forces, both good and evil, at work on
            Earth, forces that can be harnessed by human beings. Fueled by a
            transcending experience at a very young age, Noory turned his life
            into an investigation of the possibilities and influence of such
            forces, and how we can use them to enhance our lives. <br />Now
            George Noory has woven his life's work into both an amazing memoir
            and a miraculous key that readers can use to unlock the secret to
            their own sensual transcendence and liberate their limitless
            potential. Through <i>Worker in the Light</i>, George Noory will
            show readers how to:<br /><br />*Unlock the secrets to unlimited
            spiritual growth<br />*Transcend all doubts and fears<br />*Shatter
            the prison walls of their five senses<br />*Deploy the power of
            intuition to see the future<br />*Free themselves from the confines
            of time<br />*Facilitate the power of lucid dreaming
            <br /><br /><br />Through easily understood, step-by-step
            instructions, and examples from his own life, George Noory shows how
            he has surpassed his own limitations and frustrations, how he has
            freed himself from doubts and fears, and how he glimpsed the right
            way out of life's desperate straits. He will teach readers how to
            overcome fear and doubt and find happiness and success.
            <br /><br /><br /><br />At the Publisher's request, this title is

          “If you've ever wanted to travel in time, see your own future, and
          spread the wings of your spirit, this book is for you. One of the best
          books on human empowerment I have ever read.” —<i
            >Uri Geller, world-renowned psychic on Worker in the Light</i
          ><br /><br />“Even dyed-in-the-wool skeptics will enjoy this
          intriguing and often spooky exploration of George Noory's
          extraordinary world. <i>Worker in the Light</i> helps explain why
          <i>Coast to Coast AM</i> is one of the most popular radio shows in
          history.” —<i
            >Tess Gerritsen, New York Times bestselling author of Vanish</i
          ><br /><br />“From a chilling and chaotic on-air confrontation with a
          Ouija Board through a series of personal encounters with the unknown
          ranging from an out-of-body experience as a child to a terrifying
          discovery about Voodoo, <i>Coast to Coast AM's </i>mesmerizing host
          George Noory absolutely riveted me. What a life! I envy him these
          great adventures at the edge of reality...and a little farther beyond
          than most of us would dare to go. George is a very warm guy who has
          seen and done some very scary things. Late at night you can get a
          thrill by listening to George on the radio--and then, when it's really
          late, you can pick up his book...if you dare.” —<i
            >Whitley Strieber, New York Times bestselling author The Grays</i
          ><br /><br />“The ultimate primer for all those who believe there is
          more to life than simply death and taxes, written by a man who has
          made a career of bringing to light the world's experts with the rest
          of us who seek to be informed. Easy to follow, fascinating in its
          revelations, <i>Worker in the Light</i> is simply a must-read.” —Steve
