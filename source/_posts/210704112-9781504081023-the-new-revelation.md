            >The bestselling author of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries delves into
            the roots of his Spiritualist beliefs. </b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          After finishing his medical education in 1882, Arthur Conan Doyle
          considered himself a staunch materialist in regards to our personal
          destiny. But his subsequent research into Spiritualism led to his
          amazement that a great number of people—whose names were foremost in
          science—believed that the spirit was independent of the body and could
          survive it. Then, as the <i>New York Times</i> describes, “The deaths
          of his oldest son, Kingsley (in 1918), his brother (the following
          year) and two nephews (shortly after the war) led him to embrace
          Spiritualism with all his heart, convinced it was a ‘New Revelation’
          delivered by God to console the bereaved.”<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          This treatise is a summation of Doyle’s research and views, from his
          first forays into Spiritualism through mediums, seances, and his
          membership in the Psychical Research Society. He explores
          communication through automatic writing dictated by the dead, trance
          utterances, and direct voices. Also included are chapters on what has
          been proven to happen after death and the underpinnings of psychic law
          in Christianity. Doyle concludes with the assertion that divine
          sources have given to us a new revelation which alters the whole
          aspect of death and the fate of humanity. And it is not a revelation
          to be ignored.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) practiced medicine in the resort town
          of Southsea, England, and wrote stories while waiting for his patients
          to arrive. In 1886, he created two of the greatest fictional
          characters of all time: the detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner,
          Dr. Watson. Over the course of four novels and fifty-six short
          stories, Conan Doyle set a standard for crime fiction that has yet to
          be surpassed.
