              the door to your new identity, because across the threshold there
              is only the lightness of Being, and infinity in all
              directions."—Deepak Chopra</b
            ><br /><br />In <i>The Wisdom Principles</i>, Dr. Ervin Laszlo,
            authority in the fields of new science, consciousness, and
            spirituality, bridges the chasm between our understanding of science
            and the truths of spirituality, bringing an essential and timely
            message of wisdom to the world. Laszlo offers readers principles of
            empowerment that will guide the choices they make for years to come
            and will allow them to move confidently toward a better future.<br /><br />This
            book is the distillation of Laszlo’s sixty plus years spent delving
            into the mysteries of science and a lifetime of keen spiritual
            insight. The nuggets of timely wisdom offered in
            <i>The Wisdom Principles, </i>and the timeless truths revealed on
            its pages, are a precious resource for wise thinking and living. As
            we stand at a crossroads of civilization there has never been a
            greater need for them than today. Deepak Chopra, Neale Donald
            Walsch, and Gregg Braden are among the renowned thought-leaders who
            lend their voices to Laszlo’s work, framing the book and
            underscoring the power of its life-changing principles.

          "Relish the writer’s thoughts and words but at the same time be open
          and willing to meet yourself. Wisdom can inspire you when it belongs
          to someone else; it can transform you only through direct experience.
          By opening this <i>Handbook for Our Time</i>, you open the door to
          your new identity, because across the threshold there is only the
          lightness of Being, and infinity in all directions."—Deepak Chopra<br /><br />"One
          of the wisest among us has written a stellar book on wisdom. What is
          revealed is astonishing in its depth and relevance. This luminous work
          provides the missing piece to counter the missteps of our time and
          open the reader to serious reflection and potent action."—Jean
          Houston<br /><br />"...if you have a genuine interest in the purpose
          of your life, and how to make life better for yourself, your loved
          ones, and all those whose lives you touch, you have put yourself in
          the right place with this book at just the right moment."—Neale Donald
          Walsch<br /><br />"While knowledge is gained from outside, wisdom is
          brought forth from within. There are various levels of wisdom, but the
          highest wisdom is that which comes from the divine spark—the sacred
          source of our being. This new book by Ervin Laszlo will help restore
          the divine spark in the spirit of humanity."<br />—Hiro &amp; Masami
          Saionji, President &amp; Chair, The Goi Peace Foundation, Japan<br /><br />"[In
          <i>The</i> <i>Wisdom Principles</i>] Laszlo melds science and
          spiritual practice in... [a] shrewd guide to enlightened living." —<i
