          An initiatic journey into the Mysteries of the Goddess and humanity’s
          return to an age of peace and celestial light<br /><br />• Details the
          ceremonies and rituals of initiation into the Fellowship of Isis<br /><br />•
          Reveals the lost teachings of Jesus about the Divine Mother and Father
          and how the goddess Sophia is connected to Mary Magdalene as the
          Female Christ<br /><br />• Explores the many archetypes of the
          Goddess, including Isis, Brigit, and the Black Madonna, and how we can
          transform into <i>Homo luminous</i>, spiritual beings of light<br /><br />Called
          through her dreams by the Priestesses of Isis, Tricia McCannon set out
          on a spiritual journey into the Mysteries of the Goddess. After a
          fateful encounter with a high initiate of the ancient Fellowship of
          Isis, she began researching the history of Judaism and Christianity to
          find out how and when the Divine Feminine became lost. She discovered
          a forgotten age when the Creator was honored as female and humanity
          lived in peaceful societies completely free of war. She shows how we
          can return to an age of peace and celestial light if we work to bring
          the masculine and feminine energies of the world back into balance.
          <br /><br />Sharing her journey into the heart of the Divine Mother,
          McCannon details her initiation into the Fellowship of Isis, a process
          rich with ceremony, ritual, and myths of the Goddess from ancient
          Egyptian, Celtic, Greek, Hebrew, and Native American traditions. She
          reveals how the many archetypes of the Goddess, including Isis,
          Ishtar, Brigit, and the Black Madonna, can become our allies for
          self-transformation. She explores Mysteries at the heart of
          Christianity that have remained hidden for nearly 2,000 years and how
          the Gnostic goddess Sophia is tied to the Second Coming, Mary
          Magdalene, and the Female Christ. She reveals the lost teachings of
          Jesus about the Divine Mother and Father and about the Divine Daughter
          and Son.<br /><br />Through her story and her in-depth research,
          McCannon takes us on a journey to awaken the creative power of the
          Divine Feminine within each of us. Equipped with the teachings of the
          Goddess, we gain the mastery to overcome the deeply rooted
          masculine-feminine imbalance of the patriarchy and to embark into the
          future as <i>Homo luminous</i>, beings of light.
