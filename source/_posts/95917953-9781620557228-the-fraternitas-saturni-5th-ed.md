          The most in-depth work in English on the most influential secret magic
          group of 20th-century Germany, the Fraternitas Saturni, or Brotherhood
          of Saturn <br /><br />• Explores the history of the Order from its
          founding the late 1960s <br /><br />• Transcribes many rituals and
          practices in such detail that readers will be able to undertake their
          own experiential work <br /><br />• Examines the Order’s teachings on
          cosmology, the Kabbalah, the Saturnian Sacraments, electrical magic,
          and sexual mysticism--the Yoga of the Dark Light <br /><br />•
          Includes biographies of prominent members, including founder Gregor A.
          Gregorius, Karl Spiesberger (Frater Eratus), and Albin Grau (Master
          Pacitius) <br /><br />The most influential magical group in Germany
          during the 20th century, the Fraternitas Saturni, or Brotherhood of
          Saturn, is still the most active and important magical society in
          Germany today. But from its formal beginnings in 1926 in Weimar Berlin
          until around 1970 it was almost totally secret. Most of what is known
          about the Order in the English-speaking world is fragmentary and
          focuses exclusively on the sensational sex-magic practices and
          Luciferian tendencies of this magical lodge.<br /><br />Presenting the
          most in-depth work in English on the Fraternitas Saturni, Stephen
          Flowers examines the history of the Order from the mid-1920s to the
          late 1960s when the Order was fundamentally reformed. He details their
          path of initiation, secret doctrines, ritual practices, and magical
          formulas and offers biographies of the Order’s most prominent members,
          including founder Gregor A. Gregorius, Karl Spiesberger (Frater
          Eratus), Albin Grau (Master Pacitius), and Franz Saettler (Dr.
          Musallam). Exploring the Brotherhood’s guiding principles, he shows
          that at the heart of Saturnian ideology is the idea of Saturn-Gnosis:
          the interplay of opposing forces in the universe leading to the
          realization of the individual self as a god-like entity. He examines
          the Order’s teachings on cosmology, the Kabbalah, the Saturnian
          Sacraments, electrical magic, sexo-cosmology, sex-magic rites, and
          sexual mysticism--the Yoga of the Dark Light--and transcribes many of
          their actual rituals and practices, including the highly controversial
          Gradus Pentalphae, in such detail that readers will be able to
          undertake their own experiential work. <br /><br />Explaining the
          meanings of all 33 grades of the Order, the author also looks at the
          infamous Freemasonic Order of the Golden Centurium, the cult of
          Adonism, the links between Thelema and the Fraternitas Saturni, and
          the rare teachings of Master Pacitius (Albin Grau), the visual genius
          behind the film Nosferatu. He also includes rare reports by Aleister
          Crowley concerning his interaction with some of the forerunners to the
          Order and letters from the Order’s founder, Gregor A. Gregorius, to
          the “Great Beast.”

        <p>
          “Germany’s contribution to the Western magical tradition reaches back,
          in modern form, to the medieval Grail myths, the founding of the
          original Rosicrucian Order and its many later derivatives, the
          quasi-masonic operations of the Bavarian Illuminati, Germany’s
          legendary influence on the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and, of
          course, its role in the founding and early development of the Ordo
          Templi Orientis. The Fraternitas Saturni Order is heir to all of
          these, and Stephen Flowers, Ph.D., has devoted decades to expanding
          and deepening the research that led to his first groundbreaking book
          on the Order. This fourth revised and enlarged edition may at last
          represent the completion of that herculean task as it more deeply
          explores and communicates the Order’s mysteries to a yet wider
          audience. Critically, Flowers elucidates at length on the primary
          characteristic that makes the Fraternitas Saturni so unique--its dual
          emphasis on social lodge work and group ritual, balanced by its
          curriculum of disciplined individual practices that must be
          accomplished in silence by each member.”
