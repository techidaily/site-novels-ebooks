              >Could it be possible that there is a man alive on the Earth today
              that has been here for two thousand years?</strong
            >&nbsp;How has he lived so long? And why? What secrets does he know?
            Can his knowledge save the Earth or is it doomed? The humble little
            world of Caravan Master, Lazarus of Bethany, is about to get much
            bigger!&nbsp;Inception, the first book of the Secret Earth series,
            reveals the hidden beginnings of the strange, secret life of
            Lazarus. Bloodthirsty brigands attacking his caravans to Egypt
            suddenly are the least of his worries. Despite his reluctance, he is
            swept into a magical web of perilous intrigue involving his
            mysterious sister Miriam and a myriad of challenging dangers
            spanning dimensional space and time that never seem to end and are
            quite a shock for a man from 33 AD! Some say Miriam is an angel,
            while others are vehement that she is a witch. Lazarus learns the
            improbable truth about his powerful sister, and along with
            twenty-three other courageous men and women, is endowed with the
            secrets of immortality. But he learns that living the secrets is not
            as easy as knowing them. And living them comes at a price; one that
            needs to be paid in unwavering courage, stained with blood, built
            with toil, and endured with millenniums of sacrifice, defending the
            Earth from all the horrors that might have been. Beginning in a time
            and place of great, historical religious significance, Lazarus
            embarks upon a fateful stewardship that will last 2,000 years and
            change the course of human history.&nbsp;Inception&nbsp;is just the
            beginning of the odyssey.

          Embrosewyn is a very great writer. Having read the Oracles of
          Celestine Light, I was really excited to find out he had another book,
          and that was what had prompted me to get it and read it. The book
          reads like an adventure. Having read and familiarized myself with the
          Oracles of Celestine Light; this story picks up with Lazarus, who is
          acquainted with Yeshua of Nazareth through his sister Miriam. The book
          runs parallel to the Oracles of Celestine Light and is told primarily
          through Lazarus' own experiences. We travel with Lazarus through the
          Celestine Realm, where he meets Bityah, his grandfather, and back to
          Earth, all the way to the Fifth Kingdom. Be prepared for a surprise at
          the end! A very great read, awesome story that kept me glued to it the
          entire time. Hard to put down!&nbsp; – Matt Pepple

          Very touching book. If you open your heart, and switch off all your
          ordinary world, when reading the book you will see the story in its
          fullness, colours and deepness, sometimes finishing with eyes full of
          tears by emotion and deep understanding. It is necessary to leave all
          preconceptions in front of the "door" and enter barefoot and with
          humility to be witness of these outstanding events.&nbsp; Highly
          recommended.&nbsp; – Sajlixquel

          Fantastic book! If you are someone who enjoys reading something
          thought-provoking or a good adventure, Inception is for you. The
          characters are all fascinating and I find Lazarus particularly
          humorous :D I am hooked and can't wait for Book 2 to come out!&nbsp; –

          Non-fiction literary presented in fiction style. Amazing
          revelations.&nbsp; – Edgar Wilson Roial

          Powerful, page turner. Could barely put this book down. So looking
          forward to book 2 in this series.&nbsp; - Shady Spirit

          Captivating stories! I don't usually enjoy reading, and end up putting
          a book down before the end of the first chapter. This book on the
          other hand is hard for me to put down!&nbsp; – Lyndi L.

          The events are told from the perspective of Lazarus, mostly going back
          to events taking place in the book of Vivus from the Oracles of
          Celestine Light. His account of the Celestine realm is amazingly
          beautiful. The way Lazarus has come to view the killing of animals for
          meat is very moving. These books have changed the way I live life day
          to day as well as how I think of other people, animals, and even the
          plants around me. For anyone wishing to grow spiritually, these books
          are a must read.&nbsp; – Shan F.

          The book kept me turning each page to see what happens next. Very
          fascinating. It makes you think and ponder about the story. Can hardly
          wait to read the next book.&nbsp; – &nbsp;Electa K.
