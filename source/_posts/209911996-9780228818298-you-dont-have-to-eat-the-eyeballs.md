          <p>
            One day, on a remote island, Katrina Bos found herself faced with
            having to literally eat fish eyeballs. When she told her friends
            later about it, some asked her why she did it... Why didn’t she just
            say “no”?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, because she had never considered that she could say “no”. She
            was a longtime people-pleaser who almost never considered her own
            desires, preferences or comfort if it meant possibly disappointing
            someone else. She had been metaphorically “eating the eyeballs” for
            her whole life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Does this sound like you? Are you the kind of person who tends to
            sacrifice your own happiness for the sake of others? Are you too
            polite? Is it hard to be honest if it means disappointing someone?
            Are you living to please everyone except yourself?
          </p>
          <p>
            In You Don’t Have to Eat the Eyeballs, Katrina Bos shares her
            journey from eternal people-pleaser to finding true self-love and
            connection, leaving her days of eating eyeballs (real and in
            everyday life) behind her.

            >“This book was such an amazing read! I devoured it in one sitting
            and was sad when it was over. So many times in this book I caught
            myself 100% relating to the words on the page. I am sure any reader
            will have similar moments during the book. It was such a thought
            provoking read and made me question why we do what we do. Why do we
            look to others for our acceptance when we need to learn to just be
            who we truly are. and love every last unique cell of our being. This
            will be a book that I will read and reread it many times. Thank you
            Katrina for your personal journey that you shared with us!” Shelley

            >"Oh, I just love this book. The story you start the book with is
            written so well, I laughed through it.. and entered your journey,
            which soon became my journey. I love how you write in a way where
            you stick to your experience, and then so smoothly you open it up
            for me (the reader), you invite me into a state of introspection,
            without ever asking me to do so. And this is what I love the most
            about a book, the (silent) invitation to stop, be awake, and meet
            oneself - it's the kindest way to share good stuff!</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >This book has this quality of widening the awareness of the reader,
            so life cannot be the same anymore, things start to shift, different
            states of mind or emotions start to occur, even mix up in a chaotic
            way, dreams communicate more. It really spoke to me!</strong

          <strong
            >I think, or shall I say - feel, I'm a more firm woman today, yet
            more soft, and the book had to do something with it. I think you
            have laid a beautiful foundation with it for us women to unite, to
            feel this 'across-the-globe' connection with each other. I don't
            know, maybe it's because I've been watching your videos and could
            hear you actually telling me your book, but I could really relate
            also to all the friends of yours that took places in stories. I
            could really feel this universal woman-hood. You actually start all
            of the chapters with a story, where a woman friend is mentioned
            (also the ones from the island, you mostly focus on your hostess).
            So, what I want to say here is that I sense it's a book women could
            totally relate to." Arna, Slovenia</strong
