            Behind the Scenes The Heart of the Matter Volume 4 (God Cleansing My
            Insides, Me Facing Truth about Myself) is just what this book is
            about. The Lord began to do a deep cleansing of my insides, the
            inward sins that was killing me. The inward hatred and unforgiveness
            that was fueling my bad behavior. The issues that made my spirit
            sick and flesh weak. And when He began to do His work in me, I had
            to face the real truth about myself that I was no good for anything
            or anyone. I appeared to be very happy, nice, and helpful but I knew
            everything I said, did, or thought was distorted. My motives were
            all clouded and wrong. They all were coming from a place of
            falseness, it wasn't real because I wasn't real. I was detached
            emotionally and physically from everything and everyone. You can be
            making and having babies, married, working, and helping people,
            while being detached from it all. Read how the Lord Jesus cleansed
            me from my sins, washed me from my iniquities, blotted out all my
            transgressions, purged me with hyssop, and created in me a clean
            heart and right spirit that I might know truth in my inward parts
            and wisdom in my hidden parts. "Thank, thank God for you. Be
            encouraged, you are going a great work, mighty woman of God. Bless
            you." --Rev. Charles Caston Sr. (Brookhaven, MS) "Powerful writing,
            God has really done something great in you. How, when, do you find
            the time to write and in detail of every account? I am very proud of
            you." --Rev. Amos Bridges (Monticello, MS) "Sometimes the best story
            you can tell is yours. You never know what a person is going through
            or been through. Keep doing what God has called you to do. Don't let
            no one stop you. I am very proud of you and no matter where God take
            you, you are always my member first. I love you." --Rev. Wyatt Lewis
            (Hazlehurst, MS)
