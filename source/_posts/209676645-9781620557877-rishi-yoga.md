          A step-by-step guide to a powerful yet simple practice to make every
          moment an act of meditation and connect to the joy within
          <br /><br />• Details the simple practices of Rishi Yoga: easy
          physical movements, done slowly and with full awareness, combined with
          breathing exercises, sensory perception, concentration, and meditation
          <br /><br />• Explains how the practices work progressively to allow
          you to tune in to your body and cellular memory, facilitate
          concentration, and cultivate self-awareness <br /><br />• Reveals how
          to integrate Rishi Yoga into daily life to make every moment an act of
          meditation and access the peace and joy inherent within each of us
          <br /><br />In this detailed guide, yoga and meditation teacher Pierre
          Bonnasse reveals the simple movement, breathing, and awareness
          techniques of the Rishi Yoga tradition, passed down through
          generations of yogis in the Himalayas. He shows how to integrate Rishi
          Yoga into daily life for discovering and recognizing the Universal
          Self, or Pure Awareness, and unveiling the peace and joy inherent in
          each of us. <br /><br />The author begins by detailing the
          foundational practices of Rishi Yoga: easy physical movements, done
          slowly and with full awareness, combined with breathing exercises,
          sensory perception, and concentration. These moving-meditation
          exercises are physically simple enough to be performed seated,
          standing, or lying down and work progressively to allow you to tune in
          to your energetic body centers and cultivate a natural and effortless
          sense of self-awareness, which is the hallmark of Rishi Yoga, in every
          situation and at every moment. The author explores how Rishi Yoga
          trains us to become receptive to all levels of being--the physical
          body, emotional body, and subtle body--and enables access to
          tissue-level awareness and cellular memory. He also looks at this
          dynamic meditation’s rapport with traditional forms of yoga, such as
          Raja Yoga, Jnana Yoga, Hatha Yoga, and Yoga Nidra, and with the
          philosophy of nonduality, Advaita Vedanta, and modern methods of
          mindfulness. <br /><br />The author explains how, as Rishi Yoga
          advances you from personal awareness to a state of universal
          consciousness, it also becomes more and more integrated into the
          ordinary activities of daily life, making every moment--from the time
          you wake up to the time you fall asleep--an act of meditation, active
          perception, undivided attention, and expanded awareness. And once the
          practice of Rishi Yoga has permeated all facets of your waking life,
          it brings the realization that true happiness or Enlightenment is
          neither a state nor an experience to attain or acquire; it is an
          ever-present reality to be recognized behind every thought, emotion,
          speech, and action--the “ultimate Bliss” described by the ancient
          Indian scriptures.
