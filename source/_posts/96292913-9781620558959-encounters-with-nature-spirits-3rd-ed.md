          A fascinating, first-hand account of the vast powers and true nature

          <br /><br />• Includes chapters by Mike Scott, David Spangler, Dorothy

            >“To anyone who may have expressed a wish to see and talk to nature
            spirits . . . remember it took 63 years for my wish to be granted,
            so don’t lose hope.”</i
          >
          <br /><br />Have you ever wished for something with your whole heart?
          As a child, R. Ogilvie Crombie (Roc) made a wish as he dropped a penny
          into a wishing well - he asked to be able to see fairies and talk to
          them. In <i>Encounters with Nature Spirits</i>, we follow Roc’s path
          as, many years later, he meets the faun Kurmos in the Royal Botanic
          Garden in Edinburgh, discovers the realm of the elementals, and,
          eventually, meets the great god Pan himself. In his conversations with
          Pan, elves, and other nature spirits Roc realizes that the elemental
          realm is vastly more powerful than our human kingdom and possesses an
          ability to create far beyond our human means. <br /><br />Through his
          experiences Roc becomes closely involved with the Findhorn Community
          in northeast Scotland where he meets further elementals who give him
          sound advice as to how the famous Findhorn gardens should be cared for
          in order to work in harmony with nature. <br /><br /><i
            >Encounters with Nature Spirits</i
          >
          is a reminder to us all of the importance of our relationship with the
          nature kingdom. Through his example, Roc places emphasis on connecting
          and working in harmony with nature spirits. True co-creation with
          nature, working <i>with</i> rather than <i>against</i> the elemental
          kingdom, can bring about vital positive change to our endangered
          eco-system. The elementals are open to working with mankind--the
          question is, are we humans open to engaging with and respecting them
          again?

        <p>
          Trained as a scientist in his early years, R. Ogilvie Crombie (Roc)
          (1899-1975) was a self-taught mythologist, psychologist, historian,
          and esotericist. A thespian at heart, he also displayed great interest
          in the fine arts, music, and theatre. Roc lived in and around
          Edinburgh and had a close connection to the Findhorn Community,
          Scotland.
