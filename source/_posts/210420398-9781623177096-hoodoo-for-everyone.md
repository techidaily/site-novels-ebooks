              >A beginner’s guide to an inclusive Hoodoo practice--history,
              spellwork, folklore, and herbs</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />Hoodoo is a folklore tradition that was created by and
          for enslaved African Americans in the southern United States. And
          before there were honey jars, red brick dust, and everything else you
          may associate with Hoodoo, there was the need to be free.<br /><br />This
          is not the #kitchenwitch Hoodoo you’ve seen on social: it’s magic for
          those who seek liberation and healing, for those who have been hurt,
          misunderstood, or cast aside. This is Hoodoo, updated: history,
          foundations, spellwork, and spiritual guidance made accessible to
          everyone, inclusive of all backgrounds and genders.<br /><br />Written
          with three guiding Hoodoo tenets--Intention, Faith, and Direction--in
          mind, <b><i>Hoodoo for Everyone</i></b> offers everything you need to
          know about the practice: rituals, conjure, rootwork, divination,
          herbs, plants, and ancestor work.<br /><br />Shone’s modern Hoodoo
          also goes in-depth into discussions of gender, religion, and cultural
          appropriation. She answers the questions:<br />&nbsp;
          <b>•</b> &nbsp;Is Hoodoo the same as Voodoo, Lucumi, or Santeria?<br />&nbsp;
          <b>•</b> &nbsp;How do I connect to an ancestor if I don’t know my
          family’s history?<br />&nbsp; <b>•</b> &nbsp;Is Hoodoo accessible to
          queer folks?<br />&nbsp; <b>•</b> &nbsp;Can I practice Hoodoo even if
          I’m agnostic or Christian?<br />&nbsp; <b>•</b> &nbsp;How can I
          practice Hoodoo respectfully and with sensitivity?<br /><br />&nbsp;<br />With
          spells and verses organized by topic and a list of spices, herbs, and
          spellwork objects, <i><b>Hoodoo for Everyone</b></i> is for all
          readers called to Hoodoo, new and experienced alike. For anyone
          seeking a natural spiritual practice, a connection to their history,
          or a deeper connection to non-judgmental life energy, Shone offers a
          comprehensive guide to manifesting deliverance through Hoodoo magic.

          "Shone offers hoodoo ethics; an extensive index of useful Bible
          verses; a glossary of spices, herbs, and roots; and versatile chants,
          prayers, offerings, and blessings to help equip the new practitioner.
          [Her] gift is to be expansive, earthy, and inclusive."<i

          ><br /><i><br /></i><br />“From the first opening words, this book
          GRABS you! Shone is a master at painting a picture of what Hoodoo is,
          and what a Hoodoo practitioner looks like… which is anybody. She walks
          you through her own beginnings and how she came to recognize that she
          is a Hoodoo practitioner. Shone takes the reader into the richness of
          Hoodoo’s origins and history, and her personal self-discoveries that
          give the practice of Hoodoo a place in everyday life for anyone
          wishing to examine it. I found so much connection to my own practices
          in both rituals and content. I believe this book will help any person
          exploring the metaphysical arts find real-world foundations to build
          upon and enhance their own experiences. Thank you, Sherry, for sharing
          another part of your spiritual journey to help enlighten the path of
          others.”<br />—Brenda M Hardwick, energy healer and author of
          <i>Allowing the Magic, Allowing the Miracles</i><br /><br />“Sherry
          Shone shines again. In her second book, Hoodoo for Everyone, Shone
          serves as a warm and compassionate guide through her updated practice
          of Hoodoo for the modern world. Her joie de vivre radiates in her
          writing, but she never tempts readers to look away from harsh truths.
          Rather, Shone helps us face reality head on and, armed with her
          stories, wisdom, knowledge, and the tools of her magic, heal.”<br />—Amy
          Torok, coauthor of <i>Missing Witches</i>
