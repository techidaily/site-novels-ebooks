              >A guide to reading Tarot as a spark for community engagement and
              social change</b
            ><br /><br /><b>“A beacon of insight and action.”</b> —<b
              >Nyasha Williams</b
            >, author of <i>Black Tarot </i>and <i>I Affirm Me</i
            ><br /><br />The cards in the Tarot deck offer seventy-eight
            invitations for change, not only in our inner life, but beyond. Lane
            Smith invites us to read each card with an eye toward the
            collective—how we can contribute to liberation in the world.<br /><br />Smith
            shares, “Behind every story about Tarot—and about the world—are
            power relationships which are often invisible.”
            <i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> examines the structure, history, and
            components of Tarot through the lens of power, helping us better
            understand power dynamics in our life and in society.<br /><br />After
            a brief history that highlights often-ignored aspects of Tarot’s
            past, Smith guides us through each card with reflections about
            clarifying our values and putting them into action. The cards are
            organized numerologically so that each number corresponds to a type
            of action, from Ones as Acts of Initiation to Tens as Acts of
            Generation. Every individual card offers questions for personal
            reflection and social consideration. Each Major Arcana card is
            illustrated with an example from a social movement—from the
            Indigenous Water Protectors to #MeToo—that illuminates how we can
            put the power of these timeless archetypes into action today. Every
            Minor Arcana card is linked to a practical and actionable term to
            know or skill to practice. <i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> helps us
            explore:<br /><br />• What our core values are, and how we can put
            them into action<br />• How we can be socially engaged, whatever our
            life circumstance—whether it’s through what we teach our children or
            through collective action and protest<br />• How to sustain
            ourselves over time and through challenge<br /><br />As Smith
            explains, “Truth alone will not set us free. We have to act on it.”
            This guide offers inspiration for action—action that can feel
            joyful, hopeful, freeing, and empowering.

          “This book is potent, smart, and ridiculously readable. It serves to
          reminds us that Tarot is political, not only in terms of what is
          platformed, published, and discussed, but also in terms of how the
          cards offer medicine for collective healing. Lane Smith weaves the
          energies of the cards seamlessly together with key figures, events,
          and movements of resistance, connecting the reader with a time line of
          activism to appreciate and learn from. The many opportunities for
          reflection have led me to define the nature of my own activism more,
          giving me clarity on what I’m capable of and where my strengths lie.
          Lane Smith welcomes all cardslingers of conscience to not only feel
          the cards but decisively act on them, for the good of all.” —<b
            >Kelly-Ann Maddox</b
          >, author of <i>Rebel Witch</i> and <i>Witch in Darkness</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> is a book that I, a Tarot
          enthusiast and personal reader, have longed for. We are in charge of
          our destinies, and the Earth (and stars) are demanding more from
          us—how do we utilize the planetary materials we have, such as Tarot,
          to lead us toward revolution? This book is all about how the Tower
          falls. An important guide to existing more authentically with the
          world.” —<b>Fariha Róisín</b>, author of
          <i>How to Cure a Ghost </i>and <i>Who Is Wellness For?</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> is hugely informative,
          inspiring, and crucial, bringing the transformative power of Tarot to
          the realm of collective human struggle. A powerful addition to Tarot
          literature.” —<b>Michelle Tea</b>, author of <i>Modern Tarot</i
          ><br /><br />“As we navigate turbulent times and grapple with
          entrenched injustices, Lane Smith offers a prompt in collective
          liberation—a call to action in the profound wisdom of our communal
          power for the betterment of our world. In reimagining the Tarot cards
          as freedom movements and collectivists rather than individuals,
          readers will find guidance and inspiration to bridge the gap between
          insight and impact, between knowing and doing, beyond the sole into
          kinfolx. <i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> emerges as a beacon of insight
          and action in an era seeking liberation and abolitionary change, ready
          for a revolution. The book is my chosen gift for others for the
          foreseeable future.” —<b>Nyasha Williams</b>, author of
          <i>Black Tarot</i> and <i>I Affirm Me</i><br /><br />“With
          <i>78 Acts of Liberation</i>, Lane Smith lifts Tarot out of the realm
          of ungrounded archetypal psychology, shakes off the dust of elitist
          esotericism, and roots it firmly in the Earth, where it has the power
          to create real change. Through careful analysis, Smith reveals the
          myths and historical fallacies that have so often been used to
          neutralize Tarot’s revolutionary potential and restores Tarot to its
          origin as an oracle for the people. Sharing insight based on lived
          experience in justice work with deep compassion, Smith shows us how to
          engage the Tarot as a tool to unravel the lies that preserve systems
          of oppression, while reminding us that all freedom struggles are
          connected. This book is a beacon, reorienting us to the necessity of
          moving as a collective, to create change today, empowered by the
          wisdom of liberation movement ancestors who have gone before us.” —<b
            >Langston Kahn</b
          >, author of <i>Deep Liberation</i><br /><br />“I so appreciate Lane
          Smith’s thoughtful, inclusive, and thorough scholarship, which ranges
          from revolutionary to poetic. I recommend this book to beginner and
          seasoned Tarot readers alike because it is both approachable and
          filled with fresh perspectives and voices not often spotlighted.” —<b
            >Jezmina Von Thiele</b
          >, coauthor of <i>Secrets of Romani Fortune-Telling </i>and cohost of
          <i>Romanistan</i> podcast <br /><br />“<i>78 Acts of Liberation</i>
          syncretizes the history and practice of Tarot with the history and
          practice of justice, elegantly outlining the unbreakable connection
          between these divination tools and the changing world that created
          them. There is plenty here for the Tarot professional and the novice,
          both of which will learn much about bringing their work with Tarot
          congruent to how they live their beliefs. This book asks, and answers,
          many thought-provoking questions, and the writer’s style is brisk and
          engaging!” —<b>Logan Grendel</b>, TikTok creator of Focused on
          Infinity <br /><br />“<i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> is a shockingly
          enticing Tarot read that I will return to again and again. It has all
          my favorite elements of Tarot books—rethinking classic writing on the
          cards, rich examples both literal and metaphorical for us to pull
          from, and tangible ideas to take away. It’s also an INCREDIBLE
          resource for the radical history nerds among us, like myself. Lane
          Smith should teach a master class on how to make a book so in depth
          yet so approachable and downright good at the same time.” —<b
            >Cassandra Snow</b
          >, author of <i>Queering the Tarot</i> and coauthor of
          <i>Lessons from the Empress</i><br /><br />“<i
            >78 Acts of Liberation</i
          >
          is at once an incisive Tarot reference work and activist call to
          action—which is exactly the kind of insight and reflection we need to
          push the practice of Tarot forward and make it relevant, not just to
          ourselves but to ALL of our communities.” —<b>Asali Earthwork</b>,
          author of the Asali Earthwork blog and #TarotoftheQTPOC project<br /><br />“Lane
          Smith’s incredible work shows us a Tarot for today, focused on
          clear-eyed, un-sugared awareness of the power structures that
          privilege some but harm us all. This is Tarot that knows change is
          possible and that divination is a revolutionary act: a rebellious,
          antiestablishment magic with the power to destabilize the status
          quo—but only if we can see things as they are, not just as we want
          them to be. This book, a deliciously rebellious and antiestablishment
          work of power itself, reexamines everything we think we know about
          this deck of cards.” —<b>Tom Benjamin</b>, author of
          <i>Tarot on Earth</i> and <i>Your Tarot Toolkit</i><br /><br />
          “The word ‘liberation’ has been used a lot lately, especially among
          Tarot practitioners. Perpetual discussions of freedom, what it
          entails, and how to use divination to achieve it fill our social media
          and podcast feeds. But what comes next after we switch off our devices
          and face the real world? How do we put what we've gleaned from our
          spiritual practice into practice? <i>78 Acts of Liberation</i> offers
          us a way to make the cards—and our interpretations of them—more
          meaningful, more socially conscious, and more in tune with how we
          experience the world in the here and now so we can achieve freedom on
          our own terms.”—<b>Rashunda Tramble</b>, co-author of
