            Must religion and morals go together? Can one be taught without the
            other? It is a practical question for educationists, but apart from
            education, the question of the bedrock on which morals rest, the
            foundation on which a moral edifice can be built that will stand
            secure against the storms of life - that is a question of perennial
            interest, and it must be answered by each of us, if we would have a
            test of Right and Wrong, would know why Right is Right, why Wrong is
            Wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mysticism cannot be spoken of as a basis of morality in the sense in
            which Revelation, Intuition, Utility and Evolution are bases, for it
            is valid only for the individual, not for everybody, for the true
            Mystic, the dictates of the Outer or Inner God are imperial,
            compelling, but to any one else they are entirely unauthoritative.
            None the less, as the influence of the Mystic is wide-reaching, and
            his dicta are accepted by many as a trustworthy revelation - are not
            all revelations communicated by Mystics? - or as the intuition of an
            illuminated conscience, or as showing the highest utility, or as the
            result of an evolution higher than the normal, it is worth while to
            consider their value.
          </p>
          <p>
            The true Mystic, realising God, has no need of any Scriptures, for
            he has touched the source whence all Scriptures flow. An
            "enlightened" Brahmana, says Shri Krshna, has no more need of the
            Vedas, than a man needs a tank in a place which is overflowing with
            water. The value of cisterns, of reservoirs, is past, when a man is
            seated beside an ever-flowing spring. As Dean Inge has pointed out,
            Mysticism is the most scientific form of religion, for it bases
            itself, as does all science, on experience and experiment -
            experiment being only a specialised form of experience, devised
            either to discover or to verify.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Mystics are a law unto themselves, for the inner law has
            replaced the external compulsion. More rigid, for it is the law of
            their own nature; more compelling, for it is the Voice of the divine
            Will; more exacting, for no pity, no pardon, is known to it; more
            all-embracing, for it sees the part only in the whole.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it has, it ought to have, no authority outside the Mystic
            himself. It may persuade, it may win, it may inspire, but it may not
            claim obedience as of right. For the Voice of the God within only
            becomes authoritative for another when the God within that other
            self answers the Mystic's appeal, and he recognises an ideal that he
            could not have formulated, unaided, for himself. The Mystic may
            shine as a Light, but a man must see with his own eyes, and there
            lies the world's safety; the materialised Mystic, strong as he is,
            cannot, by virtue of the God within him, enslave his fellow-men.
