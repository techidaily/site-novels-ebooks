              >Introducing a revolutionary healing method that uses emotional
              freedom techniques (EFT) to resolve the traumas of our past and
              the issues of our present—for fans of <i>The Tapping Solution</i
              ><br /></b
            ><br />Karl Dawson has adapted his revolutionary practice outlined
            in&nbsp;<i>Matrix Reimprinting Using EFT</i>&nbsp;to ensure that
            practitioners focus on core beliefs to achieve lasting change in
            their clients’ lives. New science proves that it is our core beliefs
            that drive the chemical changes in the body, control our thought
            patterns, and essentially produce our reactions to the external
            world.&nbsp;<br /><br />If we can change what we believe about
            ourselves and the world around us, we can change our thoughts, and
            if we can change our thoughts . . . well, we can change anything.<br /><br />Whether
            you are new to Matrix Reimprinting with EFT or have known its
            transformative power since the early days, this book gives you a
            step-by-step guide to changing core beliefs for yourself or for your
            clients—whatever the life issue.<br /><br /><br />“Brings together
            the power of EFT with the epigenetic understanding that negative
            beliefs . . . need to be addressed if a person is to heal from
            stress-related issues in their life.” —<b

          ‘<i>Transform Your Beliefs, Transform Your Life</i> brings together
          the power of EFT with the epigenetic understanding that negative
          beliefs, formed and held subconsciously during early childhood, need
          to be addressed if a person is to heal from stress-related issues in
          their life.’<br /><b>Bruce H. Lipton</b> pHD,

          the future. These deceptively simple processes have the power to help
          you overcome the most debilitating of emotions, from grief to
          depression. By wedding two disciplines, this book offers a
          comprehensive toolkit to help reprogramme your thoughts and reclaim
          your life.’ <br /><b>Lynne McTaggart</b>, international

          control our destiny are unconscious.
          <i>Transform Your Beliefs, Transform Your Life</i> provides a
          tremendous resource for anyone who wants to learn how to gain new
          awareness, take their power back and live the life they choose! This
          book draws on the experiences of the thousands of people who have
          trained in this technique, and the information and expertise is rich

          examples to make it easy for anyone to grasp the essence of the Matrix
          Reimprinting technique. It’s also a great refresher and enhancer for

          many people fail to understand the power of their belief system and
          how it affects their lives. Reading this book will help anyone to
          examine their perceptions of the world – and more importantly,
          transform them. It’s rare to find such advice and practical tools in
          such a simple format.’<br /><b>Donna&nbsp;Gates</b>,

          ><br /><br />‘During my work as a radio presenter I have interviewed
          hundreds of experts in the self-development field. Whilst interviewing
          Karl Dawson I found that EFT Matrix Reimprinting joined together many
          scientifically proven ideas I know to be true with a practical answer
          for personal transformation. I was so excited that I decided to bring
          EFT Matrix Reimprinting into my own work with clients, with jaw
          dropping results! Now, with
          <i>Transform Your Beliefs, Transform Your Life</i>, Karl and Kate have
          created an easy-to-understand, practical guide to transforming your
          life that anyone can pick up and start to reap the benefits from
          immediately. By reading this book you are joining a wave of personal
          transformation that is building momentum and has the potential to free
          humanity from the unconscious beliefs holding us back. I’m delighted
          you have found this book and I thank Kate and Karl for bringing it to
          life.’<br /><b>Becky&nbsp;Walsh</b>, author, presenter,
