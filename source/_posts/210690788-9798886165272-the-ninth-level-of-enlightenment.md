            This book is about one man's experience of traveling beyond this
            world into the light of God.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            During Bill's near-death experience in 1994, the light he was in and
            the love within it revealed to him the answers of all humanity from
            three guardian angels in heaven. These beautiful angels emitted so
            much love and knowledge. The gifts that were given to him were the
            nine principle s of enlightenment. These principles, if implemented,
            can change our world forever.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            This is a poignant true story with a powerful message. A top
            Hollywood writer and producer said the ninth level of enlightenment
            makes for a wonderful Christian faith/spiritual screenplay or
            nonfiction book.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            In the vein of Heaven Is for Real or the Five People You Meet in
            Heaven--Bill's story begins when he leaves New York City and moves
            to Miami, Florida, as a young man not being able to find work in his
            field. This was in response to an ad in the Miami Herald to become a
            paramedic for Miami-Dade County. Bill took the job for county rescue
            and went to Mount Sinai medical school. Right before that happened,
            a chance encounter happened with a man by the name of Nigel
            Nottage--he was the lawyer for Mr. Howard Hughes. Nigel lived and
            worked in Nassau, Bahamas. In that meeting, Nigel chartered a course
            for Bill's life. It was not a recommendation. He told Bill something
            that would change his direction in life and take him on business
            travels to many parts of the world with adventure and intrigue!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Was it coincidence or prophecy that led Bill to the evening of his
            near-death experience in Tucson, Arizona, in 1994? It became a night
            of light and love, a journey to heaven.
