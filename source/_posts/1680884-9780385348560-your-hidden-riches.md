            >From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors of
            <i>The Passion Test</i> comes a book that will teach readers to
            harness the power of ritual to unlock their unique gifts and create
            a life of love, wealth, and happiness.</b
          ><br /><br />
          Rituals are the common feature of every ancient culture on Earth. Yet,
          modern society has lost touch with the power and value of ritual to
          create a rhythm for daily life, balance, and a connection with others.
          In the process, many of us have lost touch with ourselves. <br />
          <i><br />Your Hidden Riches</i> is a call to reignite the power of
          personal and community rituals--to sustain us in the midst of an
          ever-increasing onslaught of information and expectations, and to
          sustain our world by reawakening the awareness of our interconnection
          with all life.<br /><br />
          In the book you will learn to engage with: <br />
          o&nbsp;&nbsp; Rituals for Magical Relationships<br />
          o&nbsp;&nbsp; Rituals for Diet, Health, and Beauty<br />
          o&nbsp;&nbsp; Creating Wealth Through Ritual<br />
          o&nbsp;&nbsp; Rituals for the Seasons of Life<br />
          o&nbsp;&nbsp; Rituals for a Closer Family Circle<br /><br />Embracing
          ritual will allow you to finally live the life of health, wisdom, and
          love that you deserve.
