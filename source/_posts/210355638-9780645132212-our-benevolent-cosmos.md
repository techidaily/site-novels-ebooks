          <p>
            I have always been inspired by Albert Einstein's quotation that 'the
            fairest thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the
            fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true
            science. He who knows it not and can no longer wonder, no longer
            feel amazement, is as good as dead, a snuffed-out candle.'
          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst this quotation challenges the scientist, the artist and the
            spiritualist, it also has implications for all of us - to accept and
            embrace the 'mysterious' aspects of life - whilst continuing our
            unending quest for answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Science seeks answers to all unresolved questions - including its
            cosmological search for the 'Holy Grail' or in Stephen Hawking's
            words, the 'Theory of Everything'. However, as science moves closer
            to the ultimate truth, even more questions and challenges emerge,
            with quantum physics being one prime example.
          </p>
          <p>
            The question is then posed - can science now join forces with
            spirituality and religion to better understand and experience
            Einstein's prime emotion?
          </p>
          <p>
            My response in this book is to highlight recurrent themes from a
            number of eminent authors in an endeavour to seek answers, albeit
            insufficient, to such questions. These authors range from brain
            scientists, to cosmologists, to spiritual leaders, to philosophers,
            to artists, to theologians, to historians, to sceptics. In excess of
            160 references from a range of different genres have been accessed.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are some of the topics? What is God; What is the nature of
            consciousness, soul and spirit; Are we all connected - to each other
            and to the natural world; Can we confirm the suggestion that we are
            all co-creators of the cosmos? Most importantly, how can we unveil
            our 'pure essence' which is shared by all on this planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, what are the implications of these mainly empirically based
            findings on religion, using Christianity as a case study. Could we
            say that we are witnessing the green shoots of the Next Reformation
            of the Christian Church, totally different in nature from the first,
            500 years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            I trust that my book provides a useful contribution to a greater
            understanding of Einstein's fundamental notion of the 'mysterious'
            or unresolved questions in life, and how we can fully embrace the
            enchantment of this mystery. Most importantly, it aims to support
            the breaking down of the barriers that separate people, communities
            and nations. After all, we all have a responsibility for the
            stewardship of this precious Earth!
