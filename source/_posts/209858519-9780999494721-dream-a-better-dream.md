            DREAM A BETTER DREAM is a call to action. The turbulent nature of
            current events is indicative of major imbalances in personal and
            global energy fields. Judging from history, there has never been an
            era of peace and harmony, which begs the question–why is that? The
            answers to this enigma have been buried in the shrouded mystery of
            our past – before time – when our collective energies created this
            physical Universe. As a result, the Earth and everything on it
            became solidified into heavy matter and encapsulated in physical
            form, while being steeped into darkness. Over time, our thoughts,
            which are energy as we are, became darker and heavier, setting the
            stage for chaos and suffering. As all energy is in a state of
            continuous movement, it is cast out into our atmosphere, affecting
            as well as infecting others. In order to change our present
            condition, we need more people to think differently by changing
            their attitudes and minds, bringing more positive energy, or Light
            and Love, into our world. People, who are concerned about daunting
            world problems and how it will affect their own future, will find
            solutions here to heal themselves and our planet. Instead of living
            in fear and darkness, change the dream to light and love. The future
            starts now and within you! The world needs you to save it! After
            reading this inspiring and thought-provoking book, you will: •
            Understand the nature of your thoughts and harness their power •
            Discover the value of being positively selfish • Find out how to
            take stress out of stress • Learn to de-clutter your brain through
            mindfulness

          "It is not only well written and easy to read, it is fascinating
          and&nbsp;very profound and relevant at the same time.<strong>
            Marina </strong
          >delves effortlessly into deep topics that get to the very root of who
          we are and where we come from.&nbsp;By following the blueprint she
          outlines in her book, we can all work together to make the world the
          place we want it to be."

        <p>
          "Mixing history, philosophy, spirituality and practical common
          sense,<strong> Marina</strong>&nbsp;effortlessly convinces that we all
          have the power to change the world. She confirms through countless
          examples and with easy to follow explanations how change starts from
          within and how to connect to our inner selves."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Marina&nbsp;</strong>has added her eloquent voice to a growing
          number of writers who recognize that the way to heal the world is to
          begin with ourselves.&nbsp;She describes beautifully how our ego-minds
          have separated from the heart’s center and feed off conflict, drama
          and fear. The answer being to recognize that we are One and will
          become One again when we change our thoughts and emit positive
          vibrations into the world.&nbsp;
