            mean? To nurture a life? And what if that life is your own? When Dr.
            Petry loses her daughter Alexandra, she looks for ways to connect
            with loved ones in the afterlife. Along her journey, she encounters
            a literal and figurative resurrection, a transcendence of time and
            space, and a life transformed beyond whatever was imagined possible.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Dr. Paula Petry’s journey of self-discovery, healing, and personal
          empowerment began with the birth of her daughter, Alexandra, who was
          born with Spina Bifida. Complicating things, the birth and earliest
          care took place in the Dominican Republic, where in 1984, the lack of
          adequate healthcare and skilled providers forced Paula to pave a new
          path not only her daughter but for many others. She became a strong
          advocate for children with disabilities, forming what is now one of
          the leading parent advocacy organizations in the country. She brought
          that knowledge and her passion for family-centered care services to
          her faculty position at the University of Miami, School of Medicine,
          Department of Pediatrics— for over a decade preparing pediatricians to
          work with children with special health care needs. Alexandra’s death
          at age twelve brought great loss, suffering, and new beginnings. On
          her journey to healing, Paula studied energy medicine, sound healing,
          and the expressive arts, which she now blends together in retreats,
          workshops, and individual shamanic healing sessions. Her passion is to
          help women awaken to their inner truth and power, a theme and focus of
          her book, A Mother’s Courage to Awaken. Paula resides in Cooperstown
          and is a co-owner of the Light of Heart Sanctuary, the former St.
          Matthew’s church, near Sharon Springs, New York.
