            >Maximize your professional and personal potential with this
            “delightful, actionable guide” (Marie Forleo, #1
            <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of
            <i>Everything is Figureoutable</i>) that distills the wisdom of the
            zodiac into three distinct types and provides advice for each, from
            the renowned astrologers to the stars Ophira and Tali Edut, a.k.a.
            The AstroTwins.</b
          ><br /><br />Did you know that astrology can unlock unprecedented
          professional and personal success? Most people are familiar with their
          zodiac sign, but few people understand how to interpret it—and even
          fewer have any clue how to take action on it. In
          <i>The Astrology Advantage</i>, renowned astrologers Ophira and Tali
          Edut, a.k.a. The AstroTwins, present a revolutionary system that
          distills zodiac wisdom into three distinct archetypes, providing
          actionable advice to maximize your potential. To help understand your
          entire horoscope and maximize its power, The AstroTwins created the
          I*AM Method, a simple archetype that helps you use astrology to
          optimize the way you work, relate to others, and find your zone of
          thriving. The method averages the thirteen major points in your birth
          chart to one of the three archetypes:<br />
          -I (Innovator): trailblazers, pioneers, visionaries<br />
          -A (Authority): experts, award winners, achievers<br />
          -M (Maven): creator, trend spreader, artist<br />
          <br />Understanding your archetype empowers you in every aspect of
          life. The I*AM Method offers practical applications for everyday life,
          from improving relationships and optimizing time to making confident
          decisions and setting up a productive workspace. The I*AM Method helps
          you use astrology to figure out how to efficiently invest your energy
          amid competing demands of work, family, and relationships.<br />
          <br /><i>The Astrology Advantage</i> is an “easy, illuminating, and
          effective” (Bonnie Wan, author of <i>The Life Brief</i>) book that
          combines the best of <i>Atomic Habits</i> and
          <i>The Wisdom of the Enneagram</i> with astrology. This
          transformational book revitalizes how astrology is used, providing
          individualized tools and strategies, helping you make better decisions
          and optimize strengths. In short, <i>The Astrology Advantage</i>,
          teaches you how to use astrology to give you a significant edge in
          business and in life.
