          <p>
            This is a guide-book to joy. It is for the use of the sad, the
            bored, the tired, anxious, disheartened and disappointed. It is for
            the use of all those whose cup of vitality is not brimming over.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world has not yet seen enough of joy. It bears the reputation of
            an elusive sprite with finger always at lip bidding farewell. In
            certain dark periods, especially in times of international warfare,
            it threatens to vanish altogether from the earth. It is then the
            first duty of all peaceful folk to find and hold fast to joy,
            keeping it in trust for their embattled brothers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if this were not their duty as citizens of the world, it would
            be their duty as patriots. For Jean Finot is right in declaring that
            "people who are nobly happy constitute the power, the beauty and the
            foundation of the state."
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is a manual of enthusiasm - the power which drives the
            world - and of those kinds of exuberance (physical, mental and
            spiritual) which can make every moment of every life worth living.
            It aims to show how to get the most joy not only from traveling
            hopefully toward one's goal, but also from the goal itself on
            arrival there. It urges sound business methods in conducting that
            supreme business, the investment of one's vitality.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would show how one may find happiness all alone with his better
            self, his 'Auto-Comrade' - an accomplishment well-nigh lost in this
            crowded age. It would show how the gospel of exuberance, by offering
            the joys of hitherto unsuspected power to the artist and his
            audience, bids fair to lift the arts again to the lofty level of the
            Periclean age. It would show the so-called "common" man or woman how
            to develop that creative sympathy which may make him a 'master by
            proxy,' and thus let him know the conscious happiness of playing an
            essential part in the creation of works of genius. In short, the
            book tries to show how the cup of joy may not only be kept full for
            one's personal use, but may also be made hospitably to brim over for
            others.
