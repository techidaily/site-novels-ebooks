            Author Jack Watson narrates the story of his lifes journey, from his
            meager beginnings in his grannys four-room shack in Oregon to his
            career as a successful entrepreneur. In his memoir, Homers Son, he
            tells the tale of a boy who overcame a host of adversities to become
            prosperous and live to old age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watson remembers growing up during the tough times of the Great
            Depression, living with his brother in a childrens home, being
            raised by his Baptist grandmother, attending Oregon State College,
            excelling at boxing, starting a family, and working in the
            manufacturing business for forty-six years. Against the backdrop of
            being abandoned by his father, Watson tells how he persevered to
            achieve his dreams.
          </p>
          <p>
            He shares a story not only of success, but also of indiscretions,
            alcohol, separation, betrayal, loss, and sorrowa life that was
            shaped early on by a wandering and absent father and a conflicted
            mother. He acted without conscience, inflicting hurt and sorrow on
            the people he loved, and who loved him. Even so, his second wife and
            love of his life, Martina, brought tranquility and redemption into
            his life; his transgressions became a distant, sad memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Homers Son communicates how Watsons professional ambition, hard
            work, and selfish self-gratification drove his life as an adultand
            also demonstrates the inspirational power of perseverance and of
            pursuing your dreams, regardless of your circumstances.
