            >"My all-time favorite collection of poems . . . [Gibran's] poetry
            always roots me in my humanity." --Rupi Kaur, #1
            <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of
            <i>Milk and Honey, The Sun and Her Flowers,</i> and <i>Home Body</i
            ><br /><br />A stunning new hardcover edition--with a full linen
            case, copper stamping, turquoise gilded edges, and colored
            endpapers--of one of the world's most beloved and popular spiritual
            classics, featuring a new foreword by Rupi Kaur<br /><br />A Penguin
            Classics Hardcover</b
          ><br /><br />The most famous work of spiritual fiction of the
          twentieth century, <i>The Prophet</i> is rooted in Kahlil Gibran's own
          experience as an immigrant and provides inspiration to anyone feeling
          adrift in a world in flux. As a prophet named Almustafa is about to
          board a ship to travel back to his homeland after twelve years in
          exile, he is stopped by a group of people who ask him to share his
          wisdom before he leaves. In twenty-eight poetic essays, he does so,
          offering profound and timeless insights on many aspects of life,
          including love, pain, friendship, family, beauty, religion, joy,
          sorrow, and death.<br /><br />An immediate success when first
          published in 1923, <i>The Prophet</i> is a modern classic, having been
          translated into more than forty languages and sold more than ten
          million copies in the United States alone. The message it imparts, of
          finding divinity through love, made it the bible of 1960s culture and
          continues to touch hearts and minds across generations and national
          borders. This edition is illustrated with twelve of Gibran's famous
          visionary paintings and features a foreword by Rupi Kaur.<br /><br /><b

          “This book cracked my heart wide open. And I think it’s going to do
          the same to yours. . . . I’ve read&nbsp;<i>The Prophet</i>&nbsp;more
          times than I can count. I’ve owned and given away dozens of copies. I
          have one packed permanently in my travel bag. . . .&nbsp;<i
            >The Prophet,</i
          >&nbsp;and the man behind it, freed the poet in me. . . . Almost a
          hundred years later, it still feels as fresh and as relevant as ever.
          Why have I read it dozens of times? Because it doesn’t feel like
          reading. It feels like listening to my favorite song. . . . [Kahlil
          Gibran] is the conductor, the words are his orchestra, and he makes
          them dance off the page and land softly in your belly. . . . This book
          is not just for poetry lovers. It is for anyone wondering what this
          thing we call life is about. [It is] an anchor, a lifeline, and a
          friend.” —<b>Rupi Kaur, from the Foreword</b><br /><br />
          “Cadenced and vibrant with feeling, the words of Kahlil Gibran bring
          to one’s ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes. . . . If there is a
          man or woman who can read this book without a quiet acceptance of a
          great man’s philosophy and a singing in the heart as of music born
          within, that man or woman is indeed dead to life and truth.” —<b
            ><i>Chicago Post<br /></i></b
          ><br />
          “Exquisite . . . simply a masterpiece.” —<b
            ><i>The Independent </i>(London)<i><br /></i></b
          ><br />
          “Like most wisdom, most of what&nbsp;[Kahlil Gibran] has to tell is
          ancient, the possession of all men who have thought much and hard
          about fundamental things. . . . But on it all there is also the
          imprint of a rich and unusual personality. . . . Gibran offers no
          short-cuts to happiness, no easily mastered formulae for successful
          living. Essentially, he bids you look closely into your own heart and
          mind.” —<b><i>The New York Times</i></b>

          copies in English alone and have won the love of readers all over the
          world. His mystical drawings and paintings were compared by Auguste
          Rodin to the work of William Blake. Gibran died in 1931.<br /><br /><b
