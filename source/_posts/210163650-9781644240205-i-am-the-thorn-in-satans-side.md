          <p>
            I didn't know that I was supposed to be looking for Jesus.
            Apparently, the Son of God Almighty decided that it was time to
            introduce himself to a young boy at the tender age of twelve.
            However, his brain had not even completely developed. In hindsight,
            he thought God Almighty had set him up because a man of God named
            Dale Bishop came to his school, offering summer camp, and as he
            lived in the hood, summer camp was just something . . . what's the
            word . . . demonically just kept out of reach. He would only see
            images on TV or in the movies, minibikes, horses, canoes, and
            campfires, because once he showed up excitedly to sign up to go to
            camp, the white man had sprung Jesus on them, as if it was some
            last-minute precondition to go to summer camp. However, unknown to
            him, some things are just too wonderful for mere men to understand.
            God himself showed and told him in a dream, in a moment of time, all
            the ways that he could please him. And it was more than the number
            of stars!Even grown up, hardened criminals run from God with even
            the slightest proposal of us being decent and upright, and of
            course, a child can't handle that spiritual reality. But it was a
            perfect match made in heaven, because the first moment that Tony
            heard the story of Jesus's life, death, and resurrection-in
            hindsight, after so long a time of associating Jesus, the Son of
            God, with Christmas toys, he hadn't even read the Bible-instantly
            his entire being was saturated, infused with the knowledge that this
            Jesus loved him with a love that was so past this understanding, a
            love that was totally complete. Excitedly, and armed with this
            incredible knowledge, he set out to tell everyone he knew or saw of
            this great love that Jesus has for us.But not understanding what he
            was truly up against, no one wanted to hear it then. A lot of the
            people don't want to hear it now. But the only thing that's
            different now is that he doesn't give a damn what they want to hear!
            But with an undeveloped brain, he freaked out, knowing that he'd
            never signed up for the moment that Satan had come with God and
            introduced himself, a being he'd associated with Halloween and
            candy, and in that moment, everything changed. A supernatural,
            living fear had gripped his heart, and of course, he stopped talking
            about Jesus, because people didn't want to hear about him anyway.But
            the more he ran, the more the powerful and
            up-and-very-personal-in-your-face supernatural events engulfed his
            entire being, until he had even become afraid a lot of times to go
            to sleep. However, after each supernatural encounter, unknown to
            him, Jesus filled in the blanks for him just to save him and set him
            free.While others stood around, posturing, looking all
            self-dignified, trying to feel or search for God in the holy
            Scriptures, he ran. But after each divine chastisement, he quickly
            realized that what God Almighty wanted him to do far outweighed what
            he wanted to do."Keep my commandments, and live" (Prov. 7:2).
