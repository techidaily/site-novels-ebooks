          >The channeled literature of Paul Selig--who receives clairaudient
          dictation from unseen intellects called the Guides--has quickly become
          the most important and celebrated expression of channeling since
          <i>A Course In Miracles</i> rose to prominence in the 1970s.<br /><br />Selig's
          previous trilogy of channeled wisdom--<i
            >I Am the Word, The Book of Love and Creation</i
          >, and <i>The Book of Knowing and Worth</i>--won a large following
          around the world for its depth, intimacy, and psychological insight.
          The first book of his new Mastery Trilogy, <i>The Book of Mastery</i>,
          likewise attained popularity and praise. Now, Selig continues the
          "Teachings&nbsp; of Mastery" with the widely anticipated second volume
          in his new series: <i>The Book of Truth.</i><b><br /></b>

        </h4>
        <p>
          In his breakthrough works of channeled literature, author and medium
          <b>Paul Selig </b>has recorded an extraordinary program for personal
          and planetary evolution. Selig was born in New York City and received
          his master's degree from Yale. He had a spiritual experience in 1987
          that left him clairvoyant. As a way to gain a context for what he was
          beginning to experience, he studied a form of energy healing, working
          at Marianne Williamson's Manhattan Center for Living and in his own
          private practice. In the process, he began to "hear" for his clients,
          and much of Selig's work now is as a clairaudient, clairvoyant,
          channel, and empath. Selig has led channeled energy groups for many
          years. Recently featured on ABC's Nightline, he is the subject of the
          short documentary film Paul &amp; the Word, and is also featured on
          the A&amp;E/Biography channel series The UneXplained. He often appears
          on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Paul's recent and upcoming
          workshops include The Kripalu Center in Stockbridge, Massachusetts,
          The Omega Institute in Rhinebeck, New York, and the Esalen Institute
          in Big Sur, California. Also a noted playwright and educator, Paul
          serves on the faculty of NYU and directs the MFA in creative writing
          program at Goddard College. He lives in New York City, where he
          maintains a private practice as an intuitive.
