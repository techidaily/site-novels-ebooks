          <br /><br />A practical book on meditation and enlightenment, a must
          read for any spritual seeker. A less rational and more poetic Eckhart
          Tolle; Kahlil Gibran meets Krishnamurti.<br /><br />Ilie Cioara's
          message is original and unique, as he never travelled to India and
          never belonged to any traditional school. <br /><br />By practising
          the silence of the mind, through an all-encompassing attention, we
          discover and fulfill our innermost potential of becoming one with the
          divine spark that lies dormant within us.<br /><br />I Am

        </h4>
        <p>
          Ilie Cioara was an enlightened mystic who lived in Eastern Europe. His
          writings in 16 books describe the experience of meditation and
          enlightenment, as well as the practice of Self-knowing using
          all-encompassing Attention. Like Ramana Maharshi, Krishnamurti, Ekhart
          Tolle, his is a simple message of discovering our inner divine nature
          through the silence of the mind. The Silence of the Mind is the first
          in a tetralogy by Ilie Cioara to be published by OBooks, to be
          followed by The Wondrous Journey into the Depth of Our Being , Life is
          Eternal Newness and I Am Boundlessness. <br /><br />The author's
          description of enlightenment. <br /><br />
          'I was 55 years old. One morning, waking up from my sleep, I noticed
          that, psychologically, I was functioning differently from the night
          before. The mind had lost its usual turmoil. In a state of serenity I
          had never felt before, I was functioning in perfect communion with my
          whole somatic structure. <br /><br />Only after a couple of hours I
          realized what had happened to me, without pursuing this 'something' as
          an ideal to accomplish. I was, to use a simile, in the situation of a
          man blind from birth, who had just gained his sight after undergoing
          surgery. Everything around me was as new. I had an overall perspective
          on things. A silent mind allows the senses to perceive things as they
          are. <br /><br />The mind in its totality had become, through silence,
          an immense mirror in which the outside world was reflected. And the
          world I was perceiving directly through my senses revealed its own
          reality to me. My fellow beings, close friends or complete strangers,
          were being regarded indiscriminately, with a feeling of love I had
          never felt before.If any reaction of the mind surfaced, it disappeared
          immediately in contact with the sparkle of impersonal Attention. A
          state of quiet and all-encompassing joy characterized me in all
          circumstances, whether pleasant or painful. My behaviour was that of a
          simple witness, perfectly aware of what was happening around me,
          without affecting my all-encompassing state of peace.'<br />,
