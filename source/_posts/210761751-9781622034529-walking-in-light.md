            A shaman can serve as a healer, storyteller, and a keeper of
            wisdom—but most of all, teaches Sandra Ingerman, “Shamans radiate a
            light that uplifts everybody. In our culture, we tend to focus on
            methods and forget that the greatest way we can offer healing to the
            world is to become a vessel of love.” With Walking in Light, this
            renowned teacher offers a complete guide for living in a shamanic
            way—empowered by purpose, focus, and a deep connection to the
            spiritual dimensions.<br /><br />“Shamanism remains so relevant
            because it continues to evolve to meet the needs of the times and
            culture,” teaches Sandra. Here you are invited to participate in the
            modern evolution of this ancient and powerful form of spirituality,
            featuring:<br /><br />• Foundational practices—lucid instruction on
            the shamanic journey, ceremonies, and other techniques for accessing
            the hidden realms of spirit<br /><br />• Compassionate spirits,
            allies, and ancestors—how to contact and build a relationship with
            your power animals and spiritual helpers<br /><br />• Healing from a
            shamanic perspective—practices that can integrate with and enhance
            any healing modality<br /><br />• Guidance for deepening your
            connection with the environment and the rhythms of the natural
            world<br /><br />• Ways to cultivate a rich inner landscape that
            empowers your intentions and actions in every aspect of your life,
            and much more<br /><br />Walking in Light is a comprehensive
            resource filled with practical techniques, indigenous wisdom, and
            invaluable guidance for both new and experienced shamanic
            practitioners. Most importantly, Sandra Ingerman illuminates the
            meaning behind the practices—revealing our universe as a place where
            spirit is the ultimate reality, where our intentions shape our
            world, and where unseen allies support us on every step of our
            journey.
