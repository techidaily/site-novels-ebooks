          <p>
            Is there a lineage of goddesses that claims the evolutionary power
            of female sexuality? And if so, why were they pushed to the shadows
            and demeaned as harlots? Was Mary Magdalene one of them, and what
            were her teachings?
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Joanna Kujawa argues that in the process of recovering the
            healing power of the Goddess we have focused solely on the mother
            archetype and left out the other Goddess, who is often represented
            in mythical, historical, and Gnostic sources as wise, mysterious,
            and in the possession of the healing power of Eros.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking into esoteric traditions that celebrated the Goddess and her
            art of sexual alchemy, Dr. Joanna Kujawa sets out on a detective
            journey to answer these questions. She discovers that Mary Magdalene
            stands at the center of this investigation. Learn about her
            portrayal in the gnostic gospels as a teacher in her own right and
            Jesus' intimate partner, the possibility of her life as an alchemist
            in Egypt, and her last years in Southern France. Find out if Mary
            Magdalene was the same person as Mary the Prophetess of Egypt and
            her connection to the mysterious Cathars, Black Madonnas, and
            Knights Templar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether looking at Mary Magdalene, Sophia, Aphrodite, Inanna,
            Hathor, Isis, or the goddesses of esoteric Hinduism, Dr. Kujawa
            finds the archetype of The Other Goddess-the bearer of the mysteries
            of sexual alchemy that ends the division between sexuality and
            spirituality.

          Dr. Kujawa presents a very compelling, intelligent, well-researched
          account of goddesses and goddess energy that rises far above any
          typical discussion on the subject.&nbsp;Her writing is personal as
          well as historical, fresh as well as insightful. &nbsp;Her work
          fundamentally transforms knowledge about who we are and who we might
          become if we open our eyes, our minds, and our hearts. This is
          essential reading for anyone interested in new femininity and
          masculinity, exploring ancient archetypes, and deepening spiritual
          development.<strong> -Zeus Yiamouyiannis, Ph.D.</strong>, author, The

          Who was Mary Magdalene? In The Other Goddess, scholar Joanna Kujawa
          explores historical and folkloric sources and uncovers an esoteric
          tradition of women's power. This tradition is embodied in the stories
          and artistic representations of the historical woman, Mary Magdalene.
          Kujawa releases the power of Magdalene and instructs readers on how
          they can utilize the transformative potentials that Mary represents
          and personifies. <strong>-Diana Walsh Pasulka</strong>, author of
          American Cosmic: UFOs, Religion, Technology and Heaven Can Wait
        </p>
        <p>
          For our collective evolution, The Other Goddess explores and empowers
          the vital reclaiming of all aspects of the Divine Feminine and above
          all the healing grace of Her erotic wisdom and its embodiment in human
          love. <strong>-Dr Jude Currivan</strong>, cosmologist, author and
