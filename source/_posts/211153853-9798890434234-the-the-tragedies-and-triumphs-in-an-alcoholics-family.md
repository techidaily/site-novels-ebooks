          <p>
            Are you watching the self-destruction of a loved one struggling with
            substance abuse, or are you the one addicted? Perhaps you are an
            observer standing outside the arena watching the chaos and asking
            yourself, "Why don't they just quit?" If you find yourself in one of
            these situations, this book is written with you in mind. By sharing
            our family's story of tragedy and triumph, we have an opportunity to
            encourage those whose life's pathways have taken them to some of the
            same dark places our family has been.
          </p>

            If ever a story of miraculous recovery--from the agonizing valley of
            alcoholism and addiction to the mountaintop of recovery and
            service--should be told, it is the story of Gene Duffy, my dad. His
            journey took him from the gutters of Chicago's skid row, including a
            trip to the morgue to be prepped for burial, to the peace and
            serenity of California's beautiful Napa Valley, where he pioneered
            an amazing work and became one of the most prominent voices for
            recovery in his day.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is my hope and desire that this book, with my dad's life story
            serving as a platform for carrying the message of hope, and my
            sharing some lessons I learned along the way, may inspire someone
            who may be spiraling downward in cycles of misery and destruction to
            seek help. It may also encourage someone whose life has become
            difficult as they are being sorely impacted by another's deadly
            addiction. Let me assure you, there is hope! Although no one can go
            back and change their beginning, anybody can begin to change their
            ending! One does not have to live out the rest of their life captive
            to the misery and horrors of a difficult past; rather, they can
            begin today to embrace a happy and fruitful future.
