          "You are the first person I have ever heard of that deals in the
          Spiritual realm at the level that you do. You are like a “Green Beret
          “or “Navy SEAL” in the spiritual, and I don’t think that there are
          that many like you in the world." Rochelle H. – USA

          “After training, one of the lady students prayed with my sister for
          healing of cervical cancer and she was instantly healed. She also
          received spiritual activation, the spiritual gifts in her doubled in
          operation. Just last week she was at her house sitting under a tree.
          She felt the Holy Spirit urged her to turn and look across to her
          neighbor’s house opposite a soccer field. There a child had just died
          and his parents were mourning. The Holy Spirit urged her to pray in
          tongues. She continued to pray until the child rose from the dead. The
          parents and all those around were very surprised but did not know what
          or how it happened. All the while my sister never approached them or
          even gone near them."&nbsp; Many blessings, Martin R., Papua New
          Guinea

          "I read your book last week, and it is the most powerful and most
          knowledgeable book I have read on spiritual warfare. In fact, I taught
          aspects of it to my Prayer Group of about 20 prayer warriors. I also
          applied the book at a recent crusade we had last Friday attended by
          2500 people in Dubai. I have shared the book with up to 10 Pastors in
          Dubai and more than 10 Brothers and Sisters in the UK, my home
          country. I have also shared it with more people in Dubai, Doha, and
          Lagos Nigeria. TO GOD BE THE GLORY FOR SUCH GREAT REVELATION. My
          prayer is that God will continue to establish and reward you for your
          faithfulness."&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
