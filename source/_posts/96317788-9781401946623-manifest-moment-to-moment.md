          “I am in awe of the clarity these women bring to such a potentially
          transforming mission. To simplify access to the world’s mysteries we
          ourselves house is by far the most sophisticated task in the world,
          and to achieve this you don’t have to be a member of any clan—you can
          just enter with this book.”<br /><b>— Charlotte Beers</b>, CEO,
          Chairman, Undersecretary of State, and Teacher<br /><br />“If you are
          a high achiever who is interested in experiencing success without
          struggle and strain, this book will show you the pathway.&nbsp;<i
            >Manifest Moment to Moment</i
          >&nbsp;is now my new favorite book on listening to, trusting, and
          acting on my intuition. I love that I can take it in tiny bite-size
          pieces as my busy schedule allows and experience the huge results that
          come from the subtle, gentle shifts in my awareness. This book
          nourishes my own self-understanding and gives me the courage to go
          deeper.”<br /><b>— Baeth Davis</b>, Innovative Purpose Mentor and The
          Palm Pilot for the Soul of Your Business™<br /><br />“Within each of
          us runs a deep river of truth—a wide body of wisdom desiring to know
          itself, longing to manifest into relevant expressions of service to
          human evolution and ultimate freedom of the soul. Our lives can carry
          this interior wisdom from soul to body . . . from inspiration to
          manifestation. How?&nbsp;<i>Manifest Moment to Moment&nbsp;</i>takes
          on this question. Rather than finding a way to this truth, Tejpal and
          Dr. Carrol McLaughlin encourage you to find your way out of all the
          ways in which you are stuck. Unstuck, the truth becomes self-revealing
          . . . manifesting moment to moment!”<br /><b>— Deborah Jones</b>,

          intuition and understands the energy of the chakras, can elevate your
