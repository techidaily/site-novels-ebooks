          Following the success of 'Healing for Horses', in this book, Margrit
          Coates explains how readers can learn to interact with equines on a
          deep level. She gives practical advice on how to tune into your horse
          and understand what he or she is trying to communicate to you about
          wellbeing. You will discover how to sense what your horse is feeling
          and when it is healthy or suffering. You will also learn how to
          exchange healing messages, soul to soul, with your horse in order to
          improve their health and yours, and to strengthen the bond between
          you. Included are many fascinating case histories of horses and those
          who care for them, showing how they have mutually benefited by
          learning to open channels of communication. Intended for every horse
          owner, rider and handler - and the many thousands of people around the
          world who work with horses including vets, complementary therapists,
          grooms, stable hands, trainers, instructors and breeders. This book is
          for anyone who loves horses.
