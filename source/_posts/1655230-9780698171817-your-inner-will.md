              >The bestselling psychotherapist and author of The Power of
              Kindness provides concrete, meaningful lessons in developing
              internal willpower during times of personal crisis.</b
            ></b
          ><br /><br />We all experience periods of gloom, fear, and
          uncertainty. But we each possess deep reserves of inner strength and
          wisdom for dealing with such setbacks. Indeed, it is the very arrival
          of darkened circumstances that can summon our untapped energies.<br /><br />In
          <b><i>Your Inner Will</i></b
          >, therapist and philosopher Piero Ferrucci explores how to play on
          the iron chords of our interior selves. In this stirring and deeply
          practical work, Ferrucci provides a full program for the cultivation
          of the will by employing insights from classical mythology and wisdom
          teachings, neuroscience research, case studies, and psychological
          exercises.<br /><br />Each chapter focuses on a specific aspect of
          will and is followed by exercises that guide the reader in its
          development. Chapters include: Mastery, Autonomy, Freedom, Courage,
          Integrity, and Resilience. Ferrucci describes the pitfalls we face
          when our inner strength is lacking, and shows us what we can expect
          when it is healthfully developed. An effective will can guide us in
          our search for inner freedom; it helps us to take risks and to renew
          ourselves; it makes us feel strong and confident.<br /><br /><b

          is an immensely practical study that helps readers navigate crises and
          pursue more purposeful lives.

          “This book, written by a collaborator of Roberto Assagioli, presents
          the best of the emerging trends in philosophy, neuroscience, and
          cognitive therapy in order to help readers shift their focus of
          attention and regain power in their lives. Ferrucci is realistic,
          supportive, and confident in his readers’ ability to find their way
          through the labyrinth and into the light of conscious choice and
          self-determination. The book is filled with suggestions for pursuing
          individual inner wisdom, for putting what is learned into practice,
          and for opening the door to further personal growth via internal
          exploration.”<br />--<b><i>Retailing Insight</i></b
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“The author is a psychotherapist and a long-time
          student and practitioner of Roberto Assagioli’s psychosynthesis. He
          blends his clinical experience and insight with experimental studies
          to discuss the development of personal qualities that apply to the
          spiritual path: for example, depth, resilience, integrity, courage and
          the state of grace. Practical advice.”<br />--<b

          reading his balanced sentences unties knots and encourages
          openness.”<br />--<b><i>Los Angeles Times</i></b
