            This book is in memory of&nbsp;Vladimir Stepanov a.k.a. Master G.
            Epitaph: "The Lord's knight, Master G, you've been accepting
            everyone coming to you, as you followed the word of the Lord. You've
            been warming us by the warmth of your heart and tirelessly have been
            admonishing us to study ourselves and the Holy Scriptures, and to
            aspire to God's Holy Spirit."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>The Author's Introduction</p>
          <p>
            The concept of inner development has always attracted me. Since my
            early childhood I have wanted to plunge into the mystery of our
            existence, to look behind so to say an unseen curtain which limits
            our perception. The majority of people do not believe that there is
            mystery behind the visible world. Therefore I could discuss these
            matters and my experiences with just a few friends who just like me
            had more questions than answers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I once met a person who pointed out to me a very unusual spiritual
            Path to which my heart felt irresistibly attracted. However it took
            me a year to put aside my old views and intentions and leave behind
            my old life and follow him on his continuous journey. The adventures
            and new experiences and the growth of my being were necessary in
            order to accept an incomprehensible teaching that this man has been
            carrying in his heart. The best definition of this teaching could be
            in my opinion 'Russian Christian Hermeticism', and its main practice
            was spiritual alchemy. However it did not seem to me appropriate to
            write another condensed and incomprehensible alchemical treaty and I
            just described it all as it happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I should like to express my gratitude to my friends Gouri
            and Maria for their help in writing this book. They did a great job
            of preparing and editing the materials for this book and Gouri, in
            addition to it, has enriched the text with many details which had
            almost disappeared from my memory.
