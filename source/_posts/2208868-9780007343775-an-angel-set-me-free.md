            Inspiring and powerful true stories of communication with beings
            from the Afterlife from one of the country's most successful and
            sought after psychics. Includes amazing accounts of guardian angel
            interventions, mysterious rescues, miraculous recoveries,
            unexplained powers of psychic children and animals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her new book, outstanding psychic Dorothy Chitty presents an
            incredible collection of real-life stories taken from both her own
            life and from others who have experienced the power of the
            Afterlife. Find out the truth behind what happens when our guardian
            angels appear to us in various guises when we need them most – and
            often when we least expect it.
          </p>
          <p>Stories include:</p>
          Guardian angels we know – like the woman's family who cheated death on
          the Zeebrugge ferry when she heard her mother's warning from beyond
          the grave Not our time to go – when unknown forces save us, like the
          rock climber who was saved when he was lifted up by invisible hands
          when he fell thirty feet Healing miracles – when asking the angels for
          help can save us, like the young woman with a brain tumour who asked
          the spirits for and her next scan showed it had gone, leaving just a
          cross where it had been Guidance from the other side – signs that
          point you on your life path, like the man who's life changed when he
          was told to go to Canada and he discovered his ideal career Psychic
          children – how children are more open to seeing spirits and guardian
          angels, like the little girl who saw how she had died in a previous
          life, and now passed on messages from her dead brother Psychic animals
          – the bond between animals and their owners that continues after
          death, like the man whose dead dog carried on leaving his newspaper on
          the front porch
