            Stark Raving Zen&nbsp;is the story of how one woman came home to her
            soul on a road trip from Minnesota to California, a journey both
            terrifying and beautiful. Her only physical companion through each
            stage of this sudden awakening was her dog, Arya, who kept her
            grounded through shocking revelations, heavenly and hellish
            visionary experiences, and an intuitive opening including a voice in
            her left ear that guided her, working to keep her safe as her mind
            unraveled.
          </p>
          <p>
            This heroine's journey is also the story of Kristy Sweetland's life,
            including a childhood and young adulthood of trying to desperately
            control a chaotic family history filled with a parental legacy of
            addiction and mental illness that kept her psyche locked in a
            perpetual state of survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            After an outwardly successful career in the field of veterinary
            medicine, (while inwardly falling apart), she finally hit the wall,
            left her twenty-year profession, loaded Arya into her car and headed
            southwest on what she thought was a trip to see a mentor and
            counselor in California. As it turns out her soul had wildly
            different plans. This riveting true story of a road trip filled with
            benevolent ghosts and gods, angels, demons, monsters, mythology, and
            guiding voices will keep the reader glued to the page for the
            duration. Through the volcanic gift of those ten days on the road in
            January of 2009, Kristy broke through her own chains forged of
            trauma, and finally came alive.&nbsp;

          "Sensing her mental well-being unraveling, a woman embarks on a road
          trip that proves to be a mind-expanding voyage of spiritual discovery
          in this memoir...those open to ideas of mediums and the existence of
          higher dimensions should find this book enthralling. A bold, if
          occasionally terrifying, personal account of spiritual
          transformation." -- Kirkus Reviews
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>

          "Life Coach Sweetland (The Fascinated Observer) recounts in this
          gripping memoir the "spontaneous shamanic initiation" she experienced
          during a road trip from Minnesota to New Mexico...her writing conveys
          the joy and terror of mystical experience. Sweetland's surrender to
          unbidden visions will appeal to believers in mediums and channeled
          wisdom." -- Publisher's Weekly &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          "Author Kristy Sweetland delivers a masterful and emotive work that
          combines some very powerful and fascinating out-of-the-ordinary
          experiences with a reflective look at life, psychological trauma, and
          how we all have the strength and capacity to rise up and change...I
          felt for the author very deeply throughout, which is a testament to
          the book's raw exploration of feelings, and the bold narrative style
          that lets us right into Kristy's head as each moment unravels. It was
          a unique reading experience like no other. Overall, I would certainly
          recommend Stark Raving Zen: A Memoir of Coming Alive to anyone
          intrigued by the lesser-known paranormal and spiritual experiences of
          life, as well as those looking for a powerful, inspiring story of
          survival." -- Reader's Favorite (5-Star Review)

          "A uniquely powerful and thought-provoking read, Stark Raving Zen: A
          Memoir of Coming Alive speaks directly to those who find their lives
          sapped of meaning...Her descriptions of otherworldly encounters are
          simple, not overly poetic, just the memories of someone who
          experienced the indescribable and then found the best words to
          describe it. For many readers, it will raise questions to the most
          pressing questions they may have about the purpose of life. To others,
          it may provide the answers they have knowingly or unknowingly been
          seeking. Either way, Sweetland's words are likely to broker much in
          the way of reflection...A highly accessible account of spiritual
          enlightenment with broad appeal, Stark Raving Zen: A Memoir of Coming
          Alive is certainly deserving of your attention and is strongly
          recommended." -- BookViral Reviews &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

          "When you read the pages of this extraordinary book, expect to take a
          journey unlike one you've ever imagined. Kristy's vivid life
          experiences and her deft ability to express them with vulnerability,
          insight and a mastery of language is a raw and beneficent revelation
          that leaves the reader awed, shell-shocked and renewed." -- Stephanie

          "Spontaneous shamanic initiation is the theme of Kristy Sweetland's
          riveting account of a life-changing road trip, from her home in
          Minnesota to southern New Mexico and back, in company with her beloved
          dog, Arya.&nbsp;Readers will travel every step of this journey with
          Kristy-thrilled by the fearsome beauty of the Southwestern landscape,
          comforted by the calm presence of her angel dog, hearts beating
          double-time in anticipation of whatever new challenge will present
          itself, just around the next curve in the road." -- Valentine McKay,
