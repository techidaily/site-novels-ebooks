            Are you looking for a better life—one filled with true contentment
            and joy? Everyone wants to be happy, but somewhere along the way, we
            fall into “traps” that prevent us from reaching our potential, our
            goals, and the lives we want. Sure to be a classic in the self-help
            genre, Practicing Happiness utilizes a cutting-edge transdiagnostic
            approach at the forefront of contemporary behavioral therapy to help
            you break free from these psychological traps, once and for all.
          </p>
          In this important and groundbreaking workbook,
          internationally-recognized mindfulness expert Ruth Baer discusses the
          four most common psychological traps that people get stuck in:
          rumination, avoidance, emotion-driven behavior, and self-criticism. To
          help you get past these traps, Baer provides powerful,
          proven-effective mindfulness strategies, exercises, and worksheets to
          guide you, step-by-step, to the life that you deserve.<br />
          <p>
            Chapter by chapter, you will learn how to apply these mindfulness
            skills in everyday situations. And with practice, you’ll find
            yourself taking control of your thoughts and feelings in a new way.
            Instead of falling back on familiar habits, such as self-criticism,
            you will learn to foster an attitude of kindness and curiosity
            toward both yourself and the world around you.
          </p>
          By following the exercises and tips outlined in this clear, helpful
          guide, you will learn to truly transform your mind—and your life!

          “In The Practicing Happiness Workbook, Ruth Baer draws from decades of
          her own and others’ research, as well as her personal experience, to
          provide concise, accessible tips for living a meaningful, satisfying
          life. She clearly illustrates the natural human habits or ‘traps’ that
          can interfere with our well-being, while providing simple,
          step-by-step guidance to promoting new habits that will enhance and
          expand readers’ lives. Vignettes and worksheets bring concepts to life
          and help readers apply them immediately to their own lives. This book
          may be life-changing for those who have never practiced mindfulness.
          It provides valuable structure and guidance for those who have
          practiced but not yet seen the benefits they seek, and useful
          reminders even for seasoned practitioners. I highly recommend this
          workbook and plan to buy copies for many people I know.”<br />—<strong
