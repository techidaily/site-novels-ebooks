            >Come take an epic journey from darkness into the light with one of
            today’s foremost spiritual masters!<br /></b
          ><br />Noted teacher, healer, and <i>New York Times</i> best-selling
          author <b>Deborah King</b> leads you on an excursion into the inner
          sanctum of your own soul, so you can understand why you are here and
          the purpose of the age-old battle between light and dark that’s being
          waged within you.<br /><br />This book will deepen your insight into
          how and why you can be entangled in darkness and give you practical
          tools for infusing your life with Light—allowing you to raise your
          consciousness, moment by moment, each and every day. With many
          real-life examples of both darkness and light, you will be able to
          distinguish between the two in yourself and others and avoid the
          pitfalls that could lead you astray.<br /><br />You will learn about
          the incredible strength of unconditional love—<i>the</i> source of
          true happiness—and how to unearth your own inherent capabilities in
          order to tap into this powerful force and live in the light.<br /><br /><i
            >This book has been impressed by Deborah with the Energy of the
            Ages. By holding it in your hands, you too are the recipient of this
            universal vibration of boundless love.</i

        </h4>
        <p>
          Spiritual teacher and master healer Deborah King was a successful
          attorney in her 20s when a diagnosis of cancer sent her on a search
          for truth that radically changed her life. Unwilling to undergo
          invasive surgery, she turned to alternative medicine and had an
          amazing remission at the hands of a healer. Along the way, she
          conquered the alcohol and drug addictions she had used to bury an
          abusive childhood. Leaving the corporate arena for the mysterious
          world of healers, sages, and shamans, Deborah mastered ancient and
          modern healing systems, ultimately developing a powerful healing
          technique of her own. Deborah’s New York Times bestseller Be Your Own
          Shaman takes you on a one-of-a-kind journey into the powerful esoteric
          world of healing. Her first bestseller, Truth Heals: What You Hide Can
          Hurt You, explores the relationship between the suppression of painful
          emotions and their impact on health and happiness. Deborah travels
          worldwide, helping thousands of people transform their lives through
          her experiential workshops. Her LifeForce Healing and Coaching
          Programs attract those who are preparing to be leaders for tomorrow.
          She also hosts a popular weekly radio show on HayHouseRadio.com
