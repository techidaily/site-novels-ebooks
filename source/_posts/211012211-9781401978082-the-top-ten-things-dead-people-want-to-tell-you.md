          ><br /><br />If the dead could speak, don’t you wonder what they would
          say to those of us they’ve left behind? What would they tell us to
          soothe our sorrow for their loss, calm our fears of what happens when
          we die, and fire us up to live the best possible lives we can right
          now?<br /><br />These are the questions
          <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Mike Dooley seeks to answer
          in <i>The Top Ten Things Dead People Want to Tell You</i>—and ten
          years after its initial release, it’s still one of Mike’s most popular
          and beloved books. In pages filled with wisdom, humor, and, yes, joy,
          Mike explores our most pressing and profound questions about the
          afterlife—and this life—by adopting the perspective of those who have
          made the transition to the next phase. Among the revelations and
          insights they share:<br />• We were ready; you are not.<br />• There’s
          no such thing as a devil or hell.<br />• We’re sorry for any pain we
          may have caused.<br />• Your pets are just as crazy, brilliant, and
          loving here as they were there.<br />• Nothing we say can prepare you
          for the beauty of the moment you arrive.<br /><br />New readers are
          discovering <i>The Top Ten Things Dead People Want to Tell You </i>all
          the time—and this anniversary release gives the book a fresh new
          package and new preface from the author to frame its invaluable
          insights for the times we live in now.<br />&nbsp;<br /><b

            world beyond our physical sight. [He] reminds us that we’re always

            is all around you.”<br />— Gabrielle Bernstein,&nbsp;#1

          completely independent sources, I was told, ‘You need to meet Mike
          Dooley.’ After the fourth time, when the person doing the suggesting
          even went to the trouble to forward his e-mail, I took it as an omen.
          To all four of you who thought I should meet this incredible writer,
          this awesome spokesman for the Universe, for joy, and now for all our
          dead ancestors, I owe you. For everybody else, don’t wait. Get

          the world we live in, and the truth about time and space, this book
