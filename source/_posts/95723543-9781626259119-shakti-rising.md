            <b>Winner of the 2017 Nautilus Gold Book Award!</b><br /><br />
            The wisdom of the Mahavidyas, the ten wisdom goddesses who represent
            the interconnected darkness and light within all of us, has been
            steeped in esoteric and mystical descriptions that made them seem
            irrelevant to ordinary life. But with this book, written by a
            respected cardiologist who found herself on a spiritual search for
            the highest truth, you’re invited to explore this ancient knowledge
            and learn how it can be applied to daily struggles and triumphs—and
            how it can help you find unreserved self-love and acceptance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pursuit of contentment is an innate part of the human
            experience, arising from a fundamental sense of lack or
            inadequacy—all the things we believe to be wrong with us when we
            compare or judge ourselves. In our search for peace and happiness,
            we may find ourselves fighting the shadows within us, trying to
            repress or disown certain qualities, especially our anger, violence,
            discomfort, craving, and disappointment. But in order to stop this
            fight, we must expand our understanding beyond the dualities of good
            versus bad, right versus wrong, and beautiful versus ugly, and
            accept the parts of ourselves we’ve tried to deny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pulling from Eastern traditions including tantra and yoga, and
            focusing on the feminine principle of divine energy also known as
            Shakti, this book bridges the divide between dualistic concepts and
            non-dual philosophy. By exploring the symbolism of the Mahavidyas
            (Kali, Tara, Tripurasundari, Bhuvaneshwari, Tripura Bhairavi,
            Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Baglamukhi, Matangi, and Kamalatmika)—each
            with a veiled face representing a destructive quality that
            perpetuates ignorance and suffering, and a true face representing
            the wisdom that stimulates profound transformation and
            liberation—you’ll learn to embrace and incorporate every aspect of
            who you are.
          </p>
          <p>
            With practices, self-inquiry prompts, and stories from the author’s
            own spiritual seeking, this exploration of the divine feminine will
            gently reveal the source of your fear, pain, and suffering, showing
            you that when you allow those parts of yourself to arise and simply
            be, you can finally begin to heal, overcome your limitations, and
            open to the light and beauty of your true nature.

          “<i>Shakti Rising</i> exposes in a deep way the practices of the
          Mahavidyas as an ensemble to arouse and balance the energy of the
          Shakti in us. Kavitha Chinnaiyan underlines the constant cosmic play
          of the ten goddesses as if they were dancing in our unconscious, to
          unify and bring out the balance between light and darkness. This guide
          of self-discovery, based on a profound comprehension of yoga, Advaita,
          and tantra, is also very practical, and the exercises proposed are
          efficient. The images of the Mahavidyas will make the primal energy of
          the Shakti shine and manifest in front of your eyes. The reading
          itself is a sadhana. A precious book!”<br />
