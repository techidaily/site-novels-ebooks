          'Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod
          the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying:
          "Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his
          star in the East, and have come to worship him."'These words begin a
          story that will be familiar to many, whether from images on Christmas
          cards or school nativity plays, or more directly from Christian
          teaching. As often with images associated with Christmas, they have
          the power to evoke all kinds of feelings, from joy and hope to sorrow
          and doubt. But what do we really know of the birth of Jesus, and who
          were the mysterious wise men that are reported to have visited him?In
          this freshly-collated anthology of Rudolf Steiner's lectures,
          complemented with illuminating commentary by editor Margaret Jonas, we
          are offered solutions to the riddles surrounding Jesus's birth and the
          seemingly conflicting accounts within Christian scripture. Could there
          have been two different births – in other words, two infants, both
          named Jesus, born to two sets of parents?From the mystery of the
          birth, we are led to a study of the three wise men – who are mentioned
          in only one of the four Gospel accounts. Who were they, what was their
          teaching, and what was the meaning of the star they followed? And, why
          did they offer gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to the baby
          Jesus? The Three Wise Men offers solutions to the enigma of the
          identity and spiritual backgrounds of these magisterial figures and
          also provides suggestions as to their possible future roles in the
          drama of human development.Featuring colour images, this original,
          thought-provoking book is a wonderful gift for anyone seeking to
          understand the birth of Jesus and the wise men from the East.
