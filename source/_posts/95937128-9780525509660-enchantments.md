          ><br /><br />Mya Spalter spent years among candles, herbs,
          cats,&nbsp;witchy gifts,&nbsp;and spells as an employee at New York
          City’s oldest occult shop, Enchantments. In this beautifully
          illustrated book, Spalter sets out to share ways that she’s found to
          live life magically and maintain spiritual connection with the
          elements and the universe.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Spalter, a
          practicing&nbsp;witch&nbsp;herself, explores&nbsp;Wiccan&nbsp;history
          and offers an approachable compendium of&nbsp;witchcraft&nbsp;and
          magical knowledge that will equip you to construct your own original
          spells, build rituals around your intuition,&nbsp;harness the power of
          crystals, and create spell candles that can be used
          by&nbsp;witches&nbsp;everywhere. With <i>Enchantments, </i>Spalter
          creates a supportive and nonjudgmental space for you to become
          <i>your own </i>unique kind of&nbsp;witch.<br />&nbsp;<br />Black and
          queer, Spalter has written this friendly, inclusive guide

          you.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />You will learn&nbsp;why&nbsp;certain
          colors can help raise your vibrations,&nbsp;how to mix herbs for
          witchcraft, the keys to banishing unfriendly spirits (with cleansing
          rituals or even a dance party), and invaluable instructions in the
          timeless arts of astrology,&nbsp;tarot, crystals, and finding a
          parking spot downtown.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Open this book and

          “Hilariously conversational, deceptively deep, and phenomenally
          illustrated, <i>Enchantments </i>will blow your mind and make you
          laugh while imparting expert knowledge of witchcraft and why it’s so
          needed today.”<b>—Natasha Lyonne, actress and producer</b><br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          “Imagine that your best friend, a supremely cool, funny, and
          irreverent person, is also a witch willing to educate and inspire you
          toward your own witchy practice with humor, sass, and intelligence.
          Wouldn’t that be the greatest? Thankfully, Mya Spalter has written
          <i>Enchantments, </i>a book infused with jokes, real talk, occult
          know-how, stylish lingo, and serious best-friendliness.
          <i>Enchantments</i> has totally jump-started my own practice, and I am
          feeling the results daily. This book is magic—literally!”<b

          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Part memoir, part recipe book, and part poetry collection,
          <i>Enchantments </i>lets readers in on the great secret of all
          witchcraft—that being a witch is about being free to be yourself. In a
          spirit of collaboration and community and with limber humor and wit,
          Mya Spalter empowers all of us to be the best magical practitioners we
          can be. A future classic for both new and experienced witches, or
          anyone in the mood for a little divination.”<b

          but were afraid to ask! We can all use more magic in our lives in
          these trying times, and <i>Enchantments</i> will help us get started.
          Now who wants to join my coven and cast some spells?!”<b
