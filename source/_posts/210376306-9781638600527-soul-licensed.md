          <p>
            I had been getting messages from psychics for some time that I
            should do some writing. That prompted me to create a small website
            page with spiritual insights in 2012. More recently, I started
            getting e-mail prompts and deadline notices about an online book
            writing class offered by psychic medium James Van Praagh whose books
            and television show I was familiar with.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            After ignoring about six e-mail prompts, I was in Traverse City,
            Michigan, on vacation, when I thought it would be fun to get a
            psychic reading there.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The psychic told me, among other things, that my guides on the
            "other side" wanted me to do some more writing. I took this as a
            signal that I should join the online class, which had a deadline to
            join two days after my reading. So I sent in the money, and after
            much soul-searching, Soul Licensed: Tips and Tales resulted two
            years later (long after the class ended).
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            It had occurred to me that there are many people I know who seemed
            to lack any hope for something after this lifetime. Everyone was out
            to complete physical goals or have fun without any true belief about
            there being an afterlife.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            I had learned from my experiences that there was a very good reason
            to enjoy our lives here...and look forward to much more than what
            was visible on this planet. So I thought I would write this book
            sharing some of my interactions with spirits, energy, and psychics
            and offer my wisdom on how to create a healthier, more peaceful
            existence.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            You, the reader, can then take that information, in addition to the
            many clues (including license plate messages) that we get daily from
            the "other side" and discover your own reality. I hope you enjoy
            this book as much as I have enjoyed this process and living this
            life with daily reminders that we are never alone in this sphere.
            Have a wonderful journey!
