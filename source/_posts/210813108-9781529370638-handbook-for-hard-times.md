              >'Thubten is a very generous and kind monk who writes with the
              lived honesty and humour of someone who has experienced the wisdom
              he shares. His writing is full of inspiration but also the
              pragmatism needed to form a sustainable practice. He clearly
              illustrates why we all need meditation and mindfulness in our
              lives.'- Benedict Cumberbatch </b
            ><br /><br />We all go through hard times. We can experience moments
            when life feels like an uphill struggle, leading to unhappiness and
            stress. Perhaps we are feeling sad, anxious, or are challenged to
            deal with something bigger, such as a bereavement, a loss, a painful
            ending or a broken heart. It is during these moments when life feels
            difficult that we could do with some help with our thoughts and
            feelings.<br /><br />In <b>HANDBOOK FOR HARD TIMES</b>
            <i>Sunday Times</i> bestselling author of
            <i>A Monk's Guide to Happiness</i> Gelong Thubten teaches us to
            understand that happiness, kindness and resilience can be cultivated
            through reframing life's difficulties as opportunities for
            transformation. Meditation and mindfulness practices help us to
            access deep reserves of inner strength as we learn how to 'lean
            into' our suffering. Thubten suggests how we can find meaning in
            pain and discomfort, transforming deeply ingrained patterns of fear
            and resistance.<br /><br />As we discover how hard times can enhance
            the development of mindfulness, compassion and forgiveness, we can
            develop a fearless outlook on life and lasting, unshakeable
            happiness. <br /><br />This approachable and practical book,
            complete with meditations, is designed for modern times, and will be
            a valuable resource to anyone during times of struggle, but also
            during all times to encourage and build resilience and help us find
            inner contentment and peace.<br /><br /><b

          Gelong Thubten is a Buddhist monk, meditation teacher and author from
          the UK. He ordained as a monk 26 years ago at Samye Ling Tibetan
          Monastery in Scotland, and he has spent over six years in intensive
          meditation retreats, the longest of which was 4 years long. He is now
          regarded as one of the UK's most influential meditation teachers, with
          pioneering work in providing non-religious mindfulness programmes to
          businesses, hospitals, schools, universities, prisons and addiction
          counselling centres. He works with major global companies such as
          Google, Accenture and LinkedIn, and has lectured at Oxford University
          and for the United Nations. Thubten teaches mindfulness to medical
          students at the National University of Ireland, and he trained
          Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton in meditation techniques during
          the filming of Marvel's Dr. Strange. <br /><br />Thubten contributed
          to Ruby Wax's book, HOW TO BE HUMAN. His own book,
          <b>A MONK'S GUIDE TO HAPPINESS </b>was a <i>Sunday Times</i> Top Ten
          Bestseller with editions in 10 countries internationally. Thubten's
          work has been featured in <i>The Times</i> and
          <i>Guardian </i>newspapers and on Sky, the BBC and ITV. He has
          appeared on some of the leading health and wellness podcasts,
          including Deliciously Ella and Poppy Jamie's Happy not Perfect.
          <b>HANDBOOK FOR HARD TIMES</b> is his latest book.
