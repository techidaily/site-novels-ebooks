            Trusting the God Within is learning how to help yourself. It is
            developing a lifestyle that is pleasing and inspiring to yourself,
            and at the same time sets a healthy example for those who look to
            you for guidance and encouragement in their own lives. Real
            self-discipline is achievement or the ability to practice within
            when you are without.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The key is projecting that image of yourself that you would like to
            become and practicing this on a daily basis. When one begins
            fantasizing their own "script," as if their lives were the
            magnificent epic motion picture for which they have been chosen as a
            writer, producer, director, and star.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Project your creative imagination high and remember, when you set
            your subconscious robot achievement mechanism high, your behavior
            and performance will automatically seek that level. What you see
            with words, pictures, and emotions is what you'll get. Understand
            that the robot tape program can never be erased but that new images
            can be superimposed over the old ones. We must make a clear
            distinction and also comprehend the significance of the knowledge
            that the subconscious robot level of thinking cannot tell the
            difference between that which is really happening and that which is
            being rehearsed and synthetically experienced. Therefore, your
            imagination rules your world!
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The God within is truly and positively in your imagination, and you
            must learn to use it in the most positive manner to create your best
            life now. This is your moment, a great opportunity to begin a new
            life, enjoy better health, enjoy more wealth, enjoy complete
            happiness, and enjoy greater success. Talk to yourself over and over
            again when you are relaxed, visualizing yourself in the act of
            enjoying and completing each of your current goals. Visualization
            plus internalization equals realization...this is an equation I feel
            you should use for the rest of your life for the best of your life.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Take these words to heart, it works, if you work it. So now, as it
            is written herein, trust the God within and help yourself by reading
            several times this book--go out and do it!
