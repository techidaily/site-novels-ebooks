            >Reveals how the pyramids of Egypt were sophisticated generators of
            clean energy</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains how the pyramids harmonized seismic energy,
          which enabled the harvesting of electricity and the mitigation of
          earthquakes<br /><br />• Shares recent cutting-edge research on
          earthquake lights, acoustic frequency measurements and energy
          concentration within the Great Pyramid, the shafts of the Queen’s
          Chamber, the scorch marks that support the King’s Chamber explosion
          hypothesis, and the significance of the large void above the Grand
          Gallery<br /><br />• Includes technical appendices written by experts
          and top researchers<br /><br />Sharing extensive new evidence and
          cutting-edge research that the Great Pyramid at Giza was built as an
          energy-harvesting machine, Christopher Dunn details how the ancient
          Egyptians generated clean power for their civilization and reveals how
          the pyramid builders and the great inventor Nikola Tesla drew from the
          same universal knowledge. <br /><br />Looking at each part of the
          Great Pyramid, from the internal chambers to its massive stone blocks
          to the pyramidion on top, Dunn reveals how the pyramids in Egypt
          served to stimulate the release and collection of electrons in the
          Earth’s crust by harmonizing seismic energy while also attenuating the
          accumulating stresses. Drawing on exhaustive ongoing research by NASA
          scientists into the phenomenon known as “earthquake lights,” Dunn
          shows how the pyramid builders were inspired by this phenomenon and
          learned to stress igneous rocks in order to harvest the resulting
          electron flow. He looks in depth at recent research that supports the
          pyramid energy theory, including new explorations of the shafts of the
          Queen’s Chamber and analysis of the scorch marks on the ceiling of the
          Grand Gallery, which supports the King’s Chamber explosion hypothesis.
          He examines the stunning significance of the large void above the
          Grand Gallery discovered in 2017. Dunn also analyses the results of
          extensive acoustic testing and measurements at ancient sacred sites
          and shows how the pyramids were tuned to the Earth’s frequency.
          <br /><br />While the pyramids’ sophisticated energy-harvesting
          abilities are now in disarray and disuse, some remnants of their
          technologies are still there, waiting to be rediscovered and provide
          our civilization with an abundance of nonpolluting power.

          “Dunn’s shocking and cutting-edge research on nonpolluting free energy
          is forcing Egyptologists to think the unthinkable—that the technology
          on the Giza Plateau was more advanced than our current science. Bravo,
          Chris! A must-read for deep ecologists and readers seeking the real
          story of the past. At last! We have the answer to the riddle of the
          Great Pyramid.
