          <p>
            In the summer of 1953, as his mother was ironing clothes,
            two-year-old Stephen B. Satterwhite walked up to his mother and
            said, "Mommy, I've been here before." His stunned mother knelt down
            and asked him what he was talking about. He told her that he had
            lived on Earth before that he was on a big sailboat that got caught
            in a storm and he drowned.Ever since he was born, Stephen B.
            Satterwhite has seen things that other people have not seen.
            Somehow, he is wired differently, in that he understands the
            significance of what is happening in the world around him. In his
            first book, the popular True Stories from a Baby Boomer, he sets the
            stage, as he describes a normal life of heartwarming stories about
            the ups and downs of living here on Earth.That is exactly his point.
            He truly understands that we are living here on Earth that we are on
            a journey that is about to unfold into an incredible story. We are
            at a point in our history when three events are going to
            converge-our population is reaching eight billion people, our
            scientific discoveries are moving at light speed, and we are
            exploring the universe in search of life elsewhere.Very soon, as
            these three events come together, we are going to finally understand
            who, what, and why we are as human beings living here on Earth. Mr.
            Satterwhite's prophesy has finally arrived in the form of a
            captivating story about an average family of four swept up in the
            horror of a forest fire, where two of them live and two of them die
            and, by doing so, discover a beautiful life that awaits us, forever
            and ever.
