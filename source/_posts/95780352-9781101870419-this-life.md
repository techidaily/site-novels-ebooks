              of the Year by&nbsp;<i>The Guardian, The Millions,&nbsp;</i
              >and&nbsp;<i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i></b
            ><br /><br />A profound, original, and accessible book that offers a
            new secular vision of how we can lead our lives. Ranging from
            fundamental existential questions to the most pressing social issues
            of our time, <i>This Life </i>shows why our commitment to freedom
            and democracy should lead us beyond both religion and capitalism.</b
          ><br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, the philosopher Martin
          Hägglund challenges our received notions of faith and freedom. The
          faith we need to cultivate, he argues, is not a religious faith in
          eternity but a secular faith devoted to our finite life together. He
          shows that all spiritual questions of freedom are inseparable from
          economic and material conditions. What ultimately matters is how we
          treat one another in <i>this life, </i>and what we do with our time
          together. <br /><br />Hägglund develops new existential and political
          principles while transforming our understanding of spiritual life. His
          critique of religion takes us to the heart of what it means to mourn
          our loved ones, be committed, and care about a sustainable world. His
          critique of capitalism demonstrates that we fail to sustain our
          democratic values because our lives depend on wage labor. In clear and
          pathbreaking terms, Hägglund explains why capitalism is inimical to
          our freedom, and why we should instead pursue a novel form of
          democratic socialism. <br /><br />In developing his vision of an
          emancipated secular life, Hägglund engages with great philosophers
          from Aristotle to Hegel and Marx, literary writers from Dante to
          Proust and Knausgaard, political economists from Mill to Keynes and
          Hayek, and religious thinkers from Augustine to Kierkegaard and Martin
          Luther King, Jr.<i> This Life</i> gives us new access to our past—for
          the sake of a different future.

          "An important new book. . .Always lucid. . .Beautifully liberating. .
          .I admire his boldness, perhaps even his recklessness. And his
          fundamental secular cry seems <i>right</i>: since time is all we have,
          we must measure its preciousness in units of freedom. Nothing else
          will do. Once this glorious idea has taken hold, it is very hard to
          dislodge. . .I finished <i>This Life</i> in a state of enlightened
          despair, with clearer vision and cloudier purpose—I was convinced,
          step by step, of the moral rectitude of Hägglund’s argument even as I
          struggled to imagine the political system that might institute his
          desired revaluation of value."&nbsp;<b
            >—James Wood, <i>The New Yorker&nbsp;<br /><br /></i></b
          >'“A sweepingly ambitious synthesis of philosophy, spirituality and
          politics, which starts with the case for confronting mortality, and
          ends with the case for democratic socialism. . .Everything depends on
          what we do with our time together.&nbsp;<i>This Life</i>&nbsp;makes
          a&nbsp;forceful case for keeping that truth in mind.”&nbsp;<b

          ><br /><br />"Brilliant. . .An excellent place to start for those who
          want to energize the theory of socialism…&nbsp;Hägglund&nbsp;insists
          on grounding his Marxism in a broader tradition, and his version of it
          is so exciting. . .One of&nbsp;Hägglund’s&nbsp;most
          impressive&nbsp;achievements is to bring&nbsp;to a new public
          agitating&nbsp;for&nbsp;an&nbsp;embrace&nbsp;of&nbsp;freedom in our
          lives a bold project of exhuming from the grave an identifiably
          Marxist intellectual enterprise. At stake are the beliefs we all must
          share that humanity is one, the social life it has created for itself
          an affront to its destiny, and — theoretically as well as practically
          — it has a world to win."<b>&nbsp;—Samuel Moyn, <i>Jacobin</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Gives fresh philosophical and political vitality to a
          longstanding question... Much in the book will resonate with a
          democratic left that has gained strength in the seven-plus years since
          Occupy—in Black Lives Matter and the Sanders campaign, in the vision
          of the Green New Deal, in the Fight for $15 and in North Carolina’s
          Moral Mondays. <i>This Life</i> attempts to deepen the philosophical
          dimension of this left and to anchor its commitments in a larger
          inquiry: What kind of political and economic order can do justice to
          our mortality, to the fact that our lives are all we have?. . .<i

          disorientation,&nbsp;<i>This Life</i>&nbsp;is a timely, profoundly
          ambitious attempt to fashion a new foundation for personal and
          collective existence. Hägglund argues that a return to Marx’s radical
          materialism does not have to signal a loss of spirituality or contempt
          for democracy, but something like the opposite: a truly secular faith
          in a redemptive realm of freedom."&nbsp;—<b

          "An audacious, ambitious, and often maddening <i>tour de force</i>. .
          .<i>This Life</i>&nbsp;is to be applauded. Its iconoclasm and sweep
          provide an example of what intellectual activity can and should look
          like in an era of emergency. . .The answers certainly are not banal:
          starting from first principles, Hägglund seeks to reconstruct what a
          worthwhile human life might look like, and what institutional
          arrangement might make it possible. The most interesting feature of
          his analysis is the great attention he gives to temporality. . .The
          great virtue of the book: it provides a regulative ideal, and a
          reminder of what kind of world we are actually fighting for. . .We
          need a vision of justice that is plausible and compelling enough to
          organize our efforts. Hägglund’s book provides one. After a half
          century of anti-utopian suspicion, <i>This Life</i> calls us back to a
          nearly forgotten style of thinking and imagining. . .Hägglund is right
          that time is our most precious resource."&nbsp;<b

          beautifully so, it is unmistakably a work of philosophy. . .Though his
          style is more careful and deliberate,&nbsp;Hägglund’s book is also
          more deeply radical in its aims. He wants to effect a revolutionary
          change in our understanding of value, in our economies and in our

          strength and moral fortitude. The writing shows extraordinary range
          and possesses an honesty and fervor which is entirely without
          cynicism. Beneath Hägglund’s affirmation of secular faith and a
          life-defining commitment is a compelling reworking of the early
          Heidegger’s existential analytic, especially his understanding of
          finitude and ecstatic temporality. With the great difference that this
          is a distinctly leftist project, where secular faith leads to
          spiritual freedom which is understood as a Hegelian-Marxist
          affirmation of democratic socialism. Hägglund is a
          genuine&nbsp;<i>moralist&nbsp;</i>for our times, possessed of an
          undaunted resoluteness and a fierce commitment to intellectual
          probity. Maybe he’s the philosophical analogue to Karl Ove
          Knausgaard.”&nbsp;<b

          concern that underlies religious faith has always been a hope for the
          perpetuation of life on earth. Stringent, lucid, and urgent in its
          appeal for a politics equal to the prospect of climate disaster,

          America, whose work on time has already made an immense impression in

          work of immaculate clarity. When this powerful and moving book reaches
          a wide readership, it will, I think, have profound practical as well
