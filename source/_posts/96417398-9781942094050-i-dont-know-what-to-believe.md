            Americans—especially young people—are more un-churched and less
            affiliated with organized religion than at any other time in our
            history. <i>I Don’t Know What to Believe </i>addresses that decline
            and presents an insightful examination of authentic spirituality for
            those who desire answers, guidance, and perspective regarding an
            important aspect of their lives: their beliefs, and relationship to,
            a higher power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rabbi Ben Kamin addresses questions he has received from real people
            over the thirty years of his ministry, such as: Why does my parents’
            religion have to define me? Am I God’s child even if I don’t go to
            religious services? Does scripture include me in its ideology
            regardless of how much scripture I know? How do I follow my own
            spirituality while still respecting my parents’ traditions?
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Ben Kamin </b>is the award-winning author of ten books and is a
            scholar on the life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He has
            led congregations in Toronto, New York, Cleveland, and San Diego
            since his ordination in 1978.

        <p>
          <br />Rabbi Ben Kamin is a compassionate expert on spiritual
          inclusiveness, especially as it applies to a generation of deeply
          feeling yet religiously disenchanted younger people. In this
          refreshingly accessible guide for those seeking a place to alight, he
          builds a bridge between ironclad traditions and newer demographics
          that require flexibility. His enlightened application of spiritual
          pragmatism’ liberates biblical characters from theological traps and
          makes them as real, flawed, and human as we are.”--<i
            >Eric Fingerhut</i
          >, Former US Congressman and President of Hillel International<br /><br />An
          extremely timely and insightful book written for the many people who
          are dissatisfied with religion but want more than strict secularism.
          Millennials are looking for meaning, an older population is rejecting
          materialism, conscious capitalism is ascending, and Pope Francis is
          more and more appealing as a world religious leader. Rabbi Ben Kamin
          has captured the old-time spiritual values hidden in scripture. This
          is a must-read for everyone, regardless of faith background.”--<i
            >Joseph W. Jordan</i
          >, Author of <b>Living a Life of Significance</b><br /><br />Rabbi Ben
          Kamin’s new book is filled with hope and tolerance and a unique
          understanding of the original intentions of the Bible. As a survivor
          of four Nazi death camps, I can attest to what happens when people
          completely judge and humiliate others just because we have a different
          view, a different background, or a different understanding of God.
          Kamin’s book is the inspirational opposite of racism and separatism.
          In speaking to people around the world about religious bigotry, I have
          found that so many are afflicted with the need to make themselves
          bigger by making others smaller. Rabbi Kamin reminds us that in the
          eyes of God, we are all the same size and we all have equal
          value.”--<i>Lou Dunst</i>, Holocaust survivor and inspirational
          speaker<br /><br />This is a book for all those who have voted with
          their feet and walked away from organized religion, yet, at the same
          time, have a spiritual yearning to deeply connect with what is holy
          and sacred in the world and make meaning of their lives.”--<i
