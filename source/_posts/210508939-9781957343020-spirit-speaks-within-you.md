          <p><strong>"From Spirit's Mouth to Your Ears..."</strong></p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Kelle Sutliff, Psychic Medium, often speaks these words to her
            clients in her readings. Now, what if she told you that you to could
            open your own direct line of divine communication and learn to work
            within it? You can, because Spirit speaks within you every day. It
            is one of the holiest, and whole, parts of your soul, and the most
            often forgotten. We know well that life can be stressful and
            challenging, and this is most true when we don't want to listen to
            our intuition. Extra chaos! The healthiest decision you will ever
            bless yourself with is to seek better understanding of your psychic
            development.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            It's the little things that matter the most for our soul growth.
            This small book, Spirit Speaks Within You, can change your life. You
            will stop overlooking or minimizing the voice of instinct and
            intuition, bringing powerful good to you and others.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Through her stories, revelations, and tips, Kelle Sutliff, will
            inspire you to tune in and listen to your own intuitive voice. Our
            collective awakening is happening now. She reminds you to embrace
            that remarkable energy and stop mixing fear into the intuitive gifts
            that have always belonged just to you.

          "Kelle has given us all the most wonderful gift. She has given every
          reader the tools to tune in and listen to our own guides, so that we
          may navigate life's challenges, and create the very best outcome for a
          rich and meaningful journey. I have been a client of Kelle's for many
          years. Her ability to hear and channel Spirit is a true blessing.
          Thank you, Kelle, for being so generous in sharing your intuitive
          knowledge so that each of us may learn how to listen to Spirit."

          "This latest release by Kelle is not only uplifting and inspirational
          but life-changing! She teaches the reader how to tap into their 'own'
          soul by listening to their clear intuition. Spirit Speaks Within You
          encourages you to follow your heart, enabling you to be open to the
          messages sent by your spirit guides. I've personally had several
          Readings by Kelle. They've each been spot on and accurate. More
          importantly, she's taught me how to trust in my divine and spiritual
          compass."
