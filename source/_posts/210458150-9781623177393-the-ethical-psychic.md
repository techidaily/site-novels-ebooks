            >A 101 guide for psychics and energy workers to build an authentic,
            equitable, and culturally sensitive healing practice, written by
            Afro-Indigenous intuitive, scholar, and healer Dr. Jennifer Lisa
            Vest.</b
          ><br /><br />Being an ethical psychic means being of service--and
          learning how to navigate the thorny issues and unique risks inherent
          to intuitive work.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From knowing your
          boundaries and limitations--and respecting those of your clients--to
          resisting the temptation of the guru lifestyle,
          <b><i>The Ethical Psychic</i></b> offers 7 critical guiding principles
          for grounded, ethical practice. Intuitive, philosopher, and ethicist
          Dr. Jennifer Lisa Vest, PhD, explores why (and how) energy workers
          must be of service, authentic, and self-aware; learn from their
          mistakes; embody sensitivity to client needs; be humble; and listen to
          a higher source.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; With training in African American
          Hoodoo, Native American Sweatlodge, Jamaican Revivalism, Trinidadian
          Shango, Spiritualism, Reiki, Pranic Healing, and other traditions, Dr.
          Vest is uniquely positioned to address readers’ most common and
          pressing questions, like:
          <i
            >How do I avoid crossing boundaries? What if I’m making things
            worse? What privacy considerations do I need to think about? How can
            I be financially ethical? How do I avoid appropriation? What do I
            need to know about working with spirits?</i
          ><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A go-to-guide for any medium, spirit
          worker, psychic, or aspiring Reiki master,
          <b><i>The Ethical Psychic</i></b> helps readers become the grounded
          and effective healers they were born to be.

          “A spiritual toolbox for the novice to professional that supports
          psychic development authentically and with respectful discernment in
          service of self and clients. I will tap into this wise guidance often.
          Ashe Aho Dr. Vest.”&nbsp;<br />—Michele Elizabeth Lee, healer, artist,
          educator, mother, and author of

            >Working the Roots: Over 400 Years of Traditional African American
            Healing </i
          ><br />&nbsp;<br />“For far too long, the quest for knowledge related
          to spiritual practices has been fraught with imbalance of power,
          greed, and the desire by some to use the knowledge being sought to
          harm others. The challenges created for both the practitioner and for
          the recipient of the knowledge, when the practitioner is even slightly
          less attentive to the need for a high degree of ethics in their
          practice, can be devastating for both. This book is engaging,
          scholarly, accessible, and a must-read for anyone who works with
          others, regardless of the belief system, in the development of their
          spiritual gifts.”<br />—Sadé Heart of the Hawk (Mi’kmaq First Nation),
          Pipe Carrier, Iyalosha and Apetebi Ifa<br />&nbsp;<br />“Dr. Vest’s
          combination of academic, cultural, and ancestral knowledge is
          unparalleled. This book captures powerful and needed perspectives that
          will result in the betterment of the lives of individuals,
          communities, and society as a whole.”<br />—Farzana Nayani,
          consultant, speaker, and author of <i>Raising Multiracial Children</i>
