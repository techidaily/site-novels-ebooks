          exploration of the cosmic helpers who have communicated with everyday

          take many forms, and in this book spirit guide medium Yamile Yemoonyah
          will introduce you to each of the seven types: angels, ancestors,
          nature spirits, star beings, animal spirits, ascended masters and
          deities.<br /><br />Each has specific characteristics, gifts and
          challenges, and you'll learn the unique reasons your spirit guides are
          here to support you on your personal path. Featuring an extensive quiz
          to help you discover which types of spirit guide, or guides, you have,
          and practical advice on identifying and communicating with them, this
          refreshing and inclusive companion will help you to further your
          spiritual development, manifest your dreams and live your purpose.
