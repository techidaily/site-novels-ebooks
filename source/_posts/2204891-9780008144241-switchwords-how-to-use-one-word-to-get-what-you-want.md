            Discover how to talk instantly to your subconscious and manifest the
            life you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all have goals and dreams – whether it’s personally or
            professionally – that we want to achieve, but for reasons we can’t
            always fathom, our behaviour and actions can hold us back. In her
            eye-opening and effective new book, MBS expert Liz Dean reveals how
            the key to transforming those dreams into reality lies not in our
            conscious actions, but in our subconscious thoughts. By aligning the
            two, we can unleash our own power to lose weight, organise our
            lives, work more efficiently in our jobs and so much more. Switch
            Words is this simple yet incredibly powerful tool to help you get
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The greatest obstacle in achieving your goals is your subconscious.
            Whilst your conscious mind knows what you want and how to get it,
            experience tells us our subconscious mind can often ignore or
            sabotage our desires through action or inaction. Have you ever
            created a meal plan to help you lose weight, but then a couple of
            days later found yourself inching to the fridge for a snack at 9pm?
            Even though you were desperate to achieve the body image you wanted,
            part of you, for some reason, resisted.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is because the words we use when expressing our goals and
            dreams have unique vibrations which the conscious mind understands –
            but the subconscious needs a different language in order to respond
            positively and get with the programme. Through easy-to-follow
            practices and techniques, Dean guides you to acknowledge the power
            your sub-conscious can have over everyday actions, how to extract
            the right switch words to resonate your conscious desire with your
            subconscious thoughts, and how to use them effectively day to day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Methodical and verifiably successful, switch words is the effective
            way to get what you want, and this book will show you how.
