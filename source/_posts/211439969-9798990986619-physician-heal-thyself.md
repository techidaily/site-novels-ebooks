              >Dying was not something Michael J. Hession, MD, had thought much
              about. In abstract terms, he understood its inevitability, but as
              a seasoned and healthy physician, mortality seemed distant. That
              all changed on December 31, 2013, when the abstract became a
              chilling reality. Faced with a near-death experience, Hession
              found himself grappling with profound questions: How does one
              recover from a near-death experience? What skills are needed to
              navigate such a harrowing ordeal?</span

              >In the wake of his near-death experience, Hession found himself
              overwhelmed by fear, confusion, and a sense of existential dread.
              Struggling to make sense of their newfound mortality, he started
              to slowly rebuild his body, both physically and emotionally, as
              well as searching for a new meaning for life, purpose, and
              happiness.</span

              >Although the events in the book occurred between December 31,
              2013, through 2015, the inspiration to write this book came in
              January of 2020. His son was a senior resident in Medicine at
              Bellevue Hospital in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic
              that was laying waste to the world. He felt hopeless and unable to
              help as he was recovering from elective hip replacement surgery.
              It was then that he realized that his personal story of survival
              and recovery could possibly help others. Drawing from his own
              life-changing experience, Michael J. Hession, MD, offers a unique
              perspective as both a survivor of near-death and a seasoned
              physician. With over three decades of caring for critically ill
              patients, Hession brings unparalleled expertise and empathy to his
              memoir, providing invaluable insights into the complexities of
              recovery and the human spirit.</span

              >By the end of this compelling memoir, you will emerge with a
              newfound sense of resilience, hope, and purpose. Through Hession's
              poignant storytelling and practical wisdom, readers gain the tools
              and perspective needed to navigate their own healing journeys and
              feel empowered to face adversity with courage and grace, armed
              with a deeper understanding of life's fragility.</span
