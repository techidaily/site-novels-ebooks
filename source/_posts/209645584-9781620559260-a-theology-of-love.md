          A spirituality based on love, not fear <br /><br />• Shares key,
          inspiring teachings from <i>A Course in Miracles</i> as well as
          Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, and the <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>, the
          oldest known Kabbalistic text <br /><br />• Cites philosophical wisdom
          from Kant, Blake, Jung, and Gurdjieff, alongside cognitive science, to
          reveal how the world is not difficult and flawed, but our fear-based
          mind-sets lead us to see it that way <br /><br />• Offers a path to
          help you regenerate from the “fallen” state and experience God as
          infinite love and light <br /><br />In the West, theology has almost
          always meant Christian theology--a hodgepodge of beliefs that are hard
          to make sense of. Why, for example, should an all-loving, merciful God
          have gotten mad at the human race because someone ate a piece of fruit
          six thousand years ago? And why would he send part of himself down to
          earth to be tortured to death? These beliefs, stated baldly, are
          nonsensical. Millions of people are realizing this and losing their
          faith. The time has come to reenvision Christian theology without
          contradictory teachings laced with fear. It is time for a theology of
          love and miracles. <br /><br />Richard Smoley reframes Christian
          theology using logical, consistent, and easy-to-understand teachings
          of unconditional love and forgiveness. He draws inspiration not only
          from the Bible, but also from Hinduism, Buddhism, Gnosticism, and from
          esoteric and mystical teachings, such as
          <i>A Course in Miracles</i> and the <i>Sefer Yetzirah</i>, the oldest
          known Kabbalistic text. He explains how the “fallen” state of the
          human condition, not one of sin but of oblivion, leads us to
          experience the world as flawed and problematic--not wholly evil, but
          not wholly good. <br /><br />Citing philosophical wisdom from Kant,
          Blake, Jung, and Gurdjieff, alongside cognitive science, Smoley
          reveals how it is not the world that is flawed, but the way we see the
          world. Sharing key teachings from <i>A Course in Miracles</i>, he
          shows that our fear-based mind-sets--often filled with anxiety,
          suffering, and shame--lead us to feel separated from God when, in
          fact, we are all extensions of a God of infinite love and light.
          <br /><br />Offering a path to help you regenerate from the “fallen”
          state and see the real spiritual world and loving God that lies behind
          it, the author provides ways for each of us to craft our own
          self-consistent theology. He also lays out a vision for the future of
          spirituality, a path for present-day religion to transform into
          something higher and more universal.

          “I literally cannot think of another scholar who could reasonably
          attempt what Richard Smoley not only attempts but succeeds in doing in
          <i>A Theology of Love</i>. Smoley constructs a new, mysterious,
          utterly practical, and broadly gnostic Christian-based approach to
          life; it is one of mysticism, questioning, critical belief, and
          personal change. Some contemporary scholars possess the intellect,
          some possess the inner experience--but none, other than Smoley,
          possess both, and in sufficient amounts, to achieve this unprecedented
          task. When you read <i>A Theology of Love</i> you will understand why
          Richard is our generation’s premier independent scholar of
          spirituality.”
