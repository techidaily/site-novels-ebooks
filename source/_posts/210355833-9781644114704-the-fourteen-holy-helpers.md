          • Shares modern updated versions of the medieval prayers of the Holy
          Helpers, one prayer for each of the 14 saints and one prayer to call
          on all of them together <br /><br />• Explains how, even though these
          14 saints are connected to Catholic belief, they are universal in
          their powers of assistance and will come to the aid of anyone who
          calls on them <br /><br />• Recommends a healing stone to enhance the
          effect of each prayer and explains how to use the prayers to create
          protective amulets for you and your home and write a letter of
          invocation for love and success <br /><br />The art of
          invocation--calling on spirits and higher forces for assistance--has
          been practiced in folk magic traditions for centuries, with roots
          going back to early pagan and shamanic times. Called on for more than
          1,000 years, the Fourteen Holy Helpers are a group of Catholic saints
          venerated together because their intercession has been shown to be
          particularly effective in difficult times. Although they are part of
          the Christian tradition, these spiritual helpers are universal in
          their powers of assistance and will come to the aid of anyone who
          calls on them. <br /><br />In this guide to invoking the Fourteen Holy
          Helpers, Christiane Stamm presents modern updated versions of the
          medieval prayers of the Holy Helpers, which were transmitted to her
          directly from the spirit world. She explains how, even though these 14
          saints are connected to Catholic belief, their invoked powers connect
          to the original energies dwelling within humans and the Earth and
          calling on them works as a form of natural magic. She shares short
          biographies of each saint and details how to access their powers of
          healing and protection through writing out and reciting their specific
          prayers during the full moon. <br /><br />The author shares 15
          prayers--one for each Holy Helper, used to support healing for
          specific ailments or issues, and one prayer that is especially
          powerful because it calls on all 14 Helpers together. For each prayer
          she recommends a healing stone that can be added to further enhance
          the effect. The author also explains how to use the prayers to create
          protective amulets for you and your home and write a letter of
          invocation for love and success. <br /><br />Offering a step-by-step
          method to call for spiritual assistance, this book helps us realize
          the profound power of prayer and belief and reveals how magic still
          exists in our modern world.
