            >Imagine a united consciousness, an awareness of which all of our
            minds are a part . . . and a potential way out of the division,
            greed, and destruction that threaten to engulf our world.<br /></b
          ><br />In the 20th century, we were introduced to several subdivisions
          of the mind: the conscious, unconscious, subconscious, preconscious,
          and so on. But what we didn't know was that there was another level of
          consciousness, an all-encompassing, infinite dimension of shared
          intelligence: the One Mind. This universal consciousness connects all
          of us through space and time. Even now, as you read these words, you
          are participating in the One Mind.<br /><br />Emerging studies have
          shown that the One Mind isn't just an idea; it's a reality. In this
          book, Larry Dossey shares compelling research that supports the One
          Mind concept. These cases include experiences of:<br />· Shared
          thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations with a distant
          individual<br />· Communication between humans and sentient nonhumans,
          such as pets<br />· Large groups of animals-flocks, schools,
          herds-behaving in highly coordinated ways<br />· Acquisition of
          previously unknown knowledge from a person who has died<br />· Hidden
          or lost objects found through mental means alone<br />· Direct contact
          with a transcendent domain through near-death experiences<br /><br />Through
          engaging stories, fascinating case studies, and brilliant insights
          from great thinkers throughout history, One Mind explores the outer
          reaches of human consciousness. In it, you will discover a new way to
          interpret the great mysteries of our experience and learn how to
          develop the empathy necessary to engender more love, peace, and
          collective awareness. The result is a rich new understanding of what
          it means to be human and a renewed hope that we can successfully
          confront the challenges we face at this crossroads in human
          history.<br /><br />With One Mind, Dossey shows that we are not alone,
          that we are all one.

          “The Buddha said: Isolation is the world’s great misery. In an
          increasingly complex world, we feel overwhelmed, discouraged, and more
          and more alone. Dr. Larry Dossey, a gifted physician of the soul,
          relieves the agony of modern isolation. He reveals our deep
          connections to everything around us, to reassert our belonging with
          everything everywhere.”<br />—<b>Rev. Wayne Muller</b>, best-selling
          author of <i>Sabbath </i>and
          <i>A Life of Being, Having, and Doing Enough</i><br /><br />“Larry
          Dossey is a pioneer who keeps finding new frontiers. With
          <i>One Mind</i>, his merging of science and wisdom has come full
          circle, as Dossey makes the case for ancient spiritual teachings about
          the one and the many. I’m happy to embrace Larry as a kindred
          spirit.“<br />—<b>Deepak Chopra</b>, author of
          <i>Spiritual Solutions<br /><br /></i>“<i>One Mind </i>is a magnum
          opus—delightfully inspiring and exciting—while also satisfying the
          requirements of rigorous scientific inquiry. Larry Dossey is a master
          storyteller, physician, and critical thinker. And I love this
          book.”<br />—<b>Christiane Northrup, M.D.</b>, author of
          <i>Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom<br /><br /></i>“Dr. Larry Dossey’s
          excellent book <i>One Mind </i>lays the groundwork for the coming
          global awakening of consciousness and helps map out the path toward
          it. Dr. Dossey makes an eloquent case that such consciousness is,
          indeed, One Consciousness. His is the science of 2012 and beyond”<br />—<b

          /></i>
          “I have lived what Dr. Larry Dossey writes about. I know and can prove
          consciousness is nonlocal. I have used nonlocal knowing to make
          diagnoses and help make therapeutic decisions for my patients. I have
          learned to live by my experience and not by limited beliefs.”<br />—<b

          >, author of <i>A Book of Miracles</i> and
          <i>Faith, Hope &amp; Healing</i> <br /><br />“<i>One Mind</i> is a
          compelling, gripping, altogether convincing book about the nature of
          Mind and Consciousness and the deeply important role they play in our
          lives and our world. Do yourself a favor and start reading it right
          away!”<br />—<b>Ken Wilber</b>, author of The
          <i>Integral Vision<br /></i> <br />“This beautifully rendered
          masterwork from one of our most cherished&nbsp;sages of the spirit
          makes an eloquent and indisputable case for human
          consciousness&nbsp;as a singular entity. The sheer weight of
          mind-boggling evidence and compelling stories—from&nbsp;near-death
          experience and reincarnation, to creativity, ESP, and crowd
          intelligence—demolishes&nbsp;the current ‘mind equals brain’ theory of
          modern science and expands our perception of how&nbsp;the world
          works.&nbsp;<i>One Mind</i>&nbsp;is Dr. Larry Dossey’s boldest and
          most majestic work to date, with&nbsp;a powerful, lingering message:
          nature has designed us to stay connected forever.”<br />—<b
