            >“In less than two minutes, I’m in the right frame of mind to attack
            the day, focus on what’s important, and take massive action toward
            my goals and dreams” (Derek Wahler, author of

          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>Rise and Hustle</i>, Mike Whitfield shares short, daily readings
          that show you how to truly rise and hustle in the three most important
          areas of your life—physically, personally, and spiritually. Written
          for the busiest men and women who desire to get out of their rut, the
          daily challenges include stories, scripture readings, and productivity
          hacks sprinkled with humor to help build a legacy so you can make an
          impact with your family, friends, and in the world. You’ll discover
          more freedom, energy, and a sense of purpose in just ninety seconds a
          day.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Anyone who’s been able to lose 115 pounds and keep it off for years
          has an incredible amount of discipline and commitment. In his latest
          masterpiece, Mike gives an easy to follow blueprint tackling the major
          areas in life: physical, personal, and spiritual. You’ll laugh, cry,
          and question what you’ve been practicing your entire life.” —Daniel
          Woodrum, director of Turbulence Training<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “I finished reading in one day. I truly could not put it down; I even
          began to use its quotes and began change in my personal and business
          life&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If <i>Rise and Hustle</i> made an impact in
          one day, I can’t imagine what it will do when I read each day and
          practice what I learn, <i>daily</i>.” —Mia Guerra, executive editor,
          <i>Chispa Magazine</i><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “The stories that Mike has woven into the fabric of his new book,
          <i>Rise and Hustle</i>, have the power to lift you at your darkest
          hours and renew your spirit to press on and fight.” —Todd Kuslikis,
