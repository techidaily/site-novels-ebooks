          Writing together with Timothy Wyllie, the angel Georgia details the
          events of Earth’s ancient history from 39,000 BC to 16,500 BC <br />
          <br />• Chronicles the destruction of Lemuria, the Pleiadian
          evacuation of Earth, and the Lemurian diaspora that spread to India,
          Tibet, China, and South America <br />
          <br />• Explains angelic esoteric science, such as the link between
          spiritual centers on higher planes and ancient monuments on Earth,
          including the Giza pyramids <br />
          <br />• Interwoven throughout with observations about Timothy Wyllie’s
          current and previous lives, such as his long involvement with the
          Process Church and his interactions with rebel angel incarnates like
          Timothy Leary <br />
          <br />At the time of the revolt among the angels 203,000 years ago,
          Georgia was among those angels who aligned themselves with Lucifer and
          the rebels. She has remained on this world with occasional side trips
          to Zandana, another planet of quarantined rebel angels, since the time
          of the revolution, taking on the angelic role of Watcher. Writing
          together with Timothy Wyllie, Georgia provides her personal account of
          the period on Earth from 39,000 BC to 16,500 BC. <br />
          <br />Georgia shares her experiences being present as the Lemurian
          civilization in the Pacific reached its pinnacle and seismic upheavals
          overwhelmed its island home of Mu. She describes the elaborate
          Pleiadian evacuation operation and the Lemurian diaspora, explaining
          how their belief system took root in India, Tibet, China, and South
          America. She reveals how the emerging Atlantean civilization, now also
          collapsed, preyed on the far flung settlements of the Lemurian empire.
          She explains angelic knowledge of esoteric science, such as the
          spiritual influence of Venus and the link between spiritual centers on
          higher planes and ancient monuments on Earth, including the Giza
          pyramids. Georgia interweaves her story with observations about
          Timothy Wyllie’s current and previous lives, such as his long
          involvement with the Process Church and his interactions with other a
          rebel angel incarnates like Timothy Leary. <br />
          <br />Georgia shares her words, in part, to awaken some of the 100
          million rebel angels currently living their human lives, most unaware
          of their angelic heritage. She reveals how a mortal incarnation for a
          rebel angel is an opportunity to redeem her past and help prepare the
          way for the imminent transformation of global consciousness as the
          rebellion planets, including Earth, are welcomed back into the
          Multiverse.

          "The big message is - we are not alone. There are more advanced
          civilizations, there are less advanced, but for incarnate rebel angels
          there is the chance to experience mortal life and eventually take
          their rightful place in the Multiverse – and who knows what comes
          after that. The whole series is thought provoking. . . Recommended for
          incarnate rebel angels and other seekers."
