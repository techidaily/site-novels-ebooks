          The story of a mysterious southern Illinois treasure cave and its
          proof of the presence of Africans in North America long before
          Columbus.<br /><br />• Includes over 100 photographs of the artifacts
          discovered.<br /><br />• Re-creates the historic voyage of King Juba
          and his Mauretanian sailors across the Atlantic to rebuild their
          society in the New World. <br /><br />• Explains the mystery of the
          Washitaws, a tribal group of African origin, first encountered by the
          Lewis and Clark Expedition. <br /><br />In 1982 Russell E. Burrows, a
          treasure hunter in southern Illinois, stumbled on a cache of ancient
          weapons, jewels, and gold sarcophagi in a remote cave. There also were
          stone tablets inscribed with illustrations of Roman-like soldiers,
          Jews, early Christians, and West African sailors. These relics fueled
          a bitter controversy in the archaeological community regarding their
          authenticity, leading Burrows to destroy the entrance to the cave.
          <br /><br />Researching more than 7,000 artifacts removed from the
          cave before it was sealed, Frank Joseph explains how these objects
          came to be buried in the middle of the United States. It started with
          Cleopatra, whose daughter was made queen of the semi-independent realm
          of Mauretania, present-day Morocco, which she ruled with her husband,
          King Juba II. Following the execution of their son, Ptolemy, by
          Emperor Caligula, the Mauretanians rebelled against their Roman
          overlords and made their way into what is now Ghana. There they
          constructed a fleet of ships for a transatlantic voyage to a land
          where they hoped to rebuild their kingdom safe from Roman rule. They
          took with them a great prize unsuccessfully sought by two Roman
          emperors: Cleopatra's golden treasure and King Juba's encyclopedic
          library of ancient wisdom. <br /><br />Fully illustrated with many
          previously unpublished photographs of artifacts retrieved from the
          southern Illinois site, <i>The Lost Treasure of King Juba</i> is a
          compelling story that could force us to rethink the early history of
          our nation and the possibility that Africans arrived on our continent
          nearly fifteen centuries before Columbus.
