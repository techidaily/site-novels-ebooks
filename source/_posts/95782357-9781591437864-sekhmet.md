          A shamanic ritual with the Egyptian goddess Sekhmet to bring about
          alchemical transformation at the deepest levels of your being<br /><br />•
          Details how to work with Sekhmet to transform your negative behavior
          patterns and character flaws into creative impulses and higher
          energies<br /><br />• Leads you through guided visualizations,
          illustrated with photographs, to Sekhmet’s chapel at the Temple of
          Karnak and through her shamanic ritual of transformation<br /><br />•
          Includes initiations, rites of passage, and transmissions from Sekhmet
          to release your fears and anger and rejuvenate your body, mind, and
          spirit<br /><br />Sekhmet is the lioness goddess of the Egyptian
          Pantheon, a fierce protector of truth, balance, and the Cosmic order
          of Ma’at. Known and feared as the goddess of war and destruction, she
          also represents the transformative power of kundalini energy, or
          <i>sekhem</i>, and is the main goddess to harness this power for
          healing. As “She Who Comes in Times of Chaos,” she takes offerings of
          fear, rage, and weakness and transforms them into alchemical gold, the
          universal medicine for physical, emotional, and soul healing.<br /><br />In
          this book you are guided through a shamanic ritual of alchemical
          transformation and initiation with Sekhmet, working with this powerful
          goddess to release your most deeply rooted negative behavior patterns
          and be reborn into a more purified state of consciousness. Using
          intensive self-examination exercises to help you prepare to meet the
          goddess, the author leads you through a guided visualization,
          illustrated with photographs, to an ancient statue of Sekhmet in her
          chapel at the Temple of Karnak. There, you will be shamanistically
          devoured by the goddess, directly experiencing the alchemical process
          of transformation in the belly of Sekhmet until you are rebirthed as a
          fully realized adult child of the goddess. You will experience how
          your offering of pain, fear, rage, and self-sabotage is digested,
          absorbed, and assimilated by Sekhmet while you are initiated into the
          alchemy of total transformation. The initiations, rites of passage,
          and transmissions from Sekhmet included in the journey restructure the
          most important aspects of your body, mind, spirit, and soul.<br /><br />This
          journey of shamanic death, illumination, and rebirth in the belly of
          Sekhmet provides an opportunity to heal on all levels and allows you
          to release your rage, anger, and fear as you transform the energies
          that maintained them into creative and constructive solutions that
          benefit yourself, your community, and the planet.
