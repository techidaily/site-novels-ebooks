          <p><b>HOPE IS ON THE WAY!</b></p>
          <p>
            “I firmly believe that what will make you a master teacher is not
            the advice I give you; what will make you a master teacher is that
            you figure out how to solve those challenges on your own, in your
            own way.” —From the Preface
          </p>
          <p>
            As a new teacher you face numerous challenges. Right from the start
            you must learn how to manage a class full of restless students;
            develop productive relationships with fellow teachers,
            administrators, and parents; and design engaging lesson plans that
            will meet ever-increasing levels of accountability all while
            building a life for yourself in the process. It can be overwhelming
            and sometimes you can feel like you’re all alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, you came to this profession because you want to make a
            difference. How do you juggle the demands of the profession and find
            your own voice, your own teaching style, your own teaching self?
          </p>
          <p>The good news is that&nbsp;<i>you can do this</i>.</p>
          <p>
            In this down-to-earth, inspirational book, bestselling author Robyn
            Jackson offers encouragement and real-world advice for navigating
            those difficult years as a beginning teacher. Sharing stories from
            her own humbling first years as a new teacher, Robyn helps you
            tackle challenges such as motivating students, planning effective
            lessons, building relationships with parents, bouncing back from
            embarrassing mistakes, and finding your own authority as a teacher.
            She also helps you find success outside the classroom with practical
            pointers for living on a teacher’s salary and carving out time to
            have a life of your own. With candor and a good deal of wit, she
            gently guides you to develop your own teaching style and,
            ultimately, to find your own path toward mastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Robyn speaks to new educators as a trusted mentor, one who knows how
            to navigate the tricky terrain of “new teacherdom”—and knows how
            rich and rewarding the payoff will be. If you’re new to the
            profession or know someone about to embark on a teaching career,<i
              >You Can Do This</i
            >is the essential roadmap to succeeding as a new educator both
            inside and outside the classroom.
