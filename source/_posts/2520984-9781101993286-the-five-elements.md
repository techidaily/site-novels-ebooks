            ><i>The Five Elements</i> brings the wisdom of an ancient healing
            system to modern readers, helping them understand themselves--why
            they do what they do--better.<br /></b
          ><br />Dondi Dahlin shows us that we are all born with individual
          rhythms that go beyond the influence of our genes and upbringing. The
          five elements originated in ancient Chinese medicine over 2,000 years
          ago--when scholars theorized that the universe is composed of five
          forces: water, wood, fire, earth, and metal. Understanding these
          elements helps us stay in balance physically, mentally, spiritually,
          and emotionally. By explaining the efficacy of wood, the depth of
          water, the joy of fire, the compassion of earth, and the wisdom of
          metal, this book helps people understand themselves and form lasting
          connections to others, answering the age-old question of why we do
          what we do.
