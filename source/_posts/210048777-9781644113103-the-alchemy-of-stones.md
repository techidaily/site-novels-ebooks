          • 2021 Coalition of Visionary Resources Gold Award <br /><br />•

            >The Alchemy of Stones</i
          >
          presents an inspired breakthrough in Robert Simmons’ thirty-five year
          career of exploring and revealing the spiritual qualities and
          potentials of minerals, crystals, and gemstones. This holistic,
          Earth-based framework for understanding stones and their energies
          initiates readers into an alchemical worldview that leads to spiritual
          healing, transformation, and transcendence. <br /><br />Engaging
          readers step by step, Simmons provides guidance on discovering and
          harnessing the three human powers of intention, attention, and
          imagination, each a crucial component for meeting and working in
          harmony with the energies of the Stone Beings. Simmons also introduces
          us to the Divine Feminine intelligence known as Sophia, or Wisdom. The
          Stone Beings are her emissaries, and through relating and co-creating
          with them, the healing and redemption of ourselves and the Earth
          becomes a reality. <br /><br />Offering an illustrated dictionary of
          the spiritual qualities of more than 375 different minerals, crystals,
          and gemstones, Simmons also explores in depth what he calls the Four
          Cornerstones of the Alchemy of Stones: Moldavite, Phenacite,
          Azeztulite, and Rosophia. He discusses the stages of alchemical
          transformation and provides meditative practices with specific stones
          to go with each stage. He also explores how to work with stone
          mandalas, crystal body layouts, gemstone elixirs, and Orgonite energy
          devices and details powerful techniques for working with stones. Woven
          throughout are Simmons’ personal stories of the pivotal mystical
          experiences that triggered his capacity to feel stone energies and led
          him to develop his relationship with the stones, revealing how this
          work can open minds and awaken hearts. <br /><br />Lavishly
          illustrated, <i>The Alchemy of Stones</i> is an invitation to a
          journey of enlightenment, transformation, and spiritual metamorphosis
          aligned with the path of our living, conscious Earth.
