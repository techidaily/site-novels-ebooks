            Do you wonder what your true path in life is? We each have a purpose
            and a mission. However, uncovering this purpose can be challenging,
            and often daunting. If you are like most, you have probably asked
            yourself, “Why am I here?” But where do you turn for answers?
            Religion? Psychology? Spirituality?
          </p>
          <p>
            Written by psychologist and bestselling author Matthew McKay,
            charismatic Silicon Valley spiritual leader Seán ÓLaoire, and
            bestselling author Ralph Metzner, Why? will help you see what your
            past and present experiences are telling you about the spiritual
            theme in your life; one that is visible when you know how to read
            the signs. Your experiences may be that of a Healer/Peacemaker, an
            Explorer/Scientist, a Warrior/Guardian, an Artist/Designer, a
            Teacher/Communicator, or a Builder/Organizer. By showing you how to
            uncover your unique path, this book will help you discover your
            life’s true meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book will help you dismantle tired, old traditions that tell us
            that we should avoid pain and seek pleasure or pursue power, and
            shows us that even pain can play an important part in how we choose
            to live. The book also helps you to create your own cosmology that
            unites your beliefs with your life’s mission, helps you recognize
            that individual mission, and outline exercises to bring you into
            alignment with this mission via personal practices. Despite these
            heady topics, the book is written in an accessible, inspiring, and
            entertaining tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are here to see, to know, to gather whatever wisdom our life
            offers, and to make use of that wisdom as our soul matures. A
            seamless blending of deep spirituality, good psychology and
            practical living, Why? offers the tools that you need to gain
            knowledge and awareness of yourself at the deepest level. So get
            ready to reveal your personal path in life, and begin living life to
            its fullest.

          “This little book has a very big goal, nothing less than helping
          readers discover their life purpose. They accomplish this task by
          pulling from the wisdom of the past, as well as by providing
          provocative exercises that direct readers toward self-knowledge. Many
          books have similar goals, but few have succeeded as well as McKay,
          ÓLaoire, and Metzner, and have done so in such an engaging and
          reader-friendly style.”<br />—<strong>Stanley Krippner, PhD</strong>,
