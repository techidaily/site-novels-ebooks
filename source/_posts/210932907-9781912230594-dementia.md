          'Those involved with this illness professionally or as a relative can
          learn much from this study, which motivates them to a deepening of
          anthroposophy. They will also be inspired by how the author brings the
          illness into the realm of the living impulse of Christ.' – Michaela
          GlöcklerDementia, a broad category of brain diseases including
          Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, affects millions of people worldwide.
          Although its impact is primarily focused on populations of Western
          countries, orthodox medicine has not been able to discover the causes
          of dementia, let alone develop successful treatments or a cure. Given
          this situation, there are good reasons to investigate the
          psycho-spiritual factors connected to the outbreak of the illness. As
          the author states in her Preface: 'The conception of man that is given
          priority today by the scientific world hardly takes into account that
          in addition to the physical-material component, for which certain
          degenerative or pathological processes can be determined with the help
          of technical apparatus, there are other components of his being to be
          taken into account which cannot be investigated in that way. So long
          as the cause of an illness is not sought in connection with those
          spiritual components of the human being, a successful treatment of the
          patient cannot be assured.'Developing successful methods of treatment
          requires a full understanding of the human being. This can not be
          achieved through observation with the outer senses only, but
          increasingly calls for spiritual-scientific perception. Through this
          method, as founded by Rudolf Steiner, great service can be rendered to
          humanity, including precise research into the causes of ill-health.
          The factors involved in the eruption of modern afflictions, such as
          dementia, can be determined by careful consideration of humanity's –
          as well as the individual's – destiny.In this succinct but rich study,
          Judith von Halle describes her investigations into the phenomenon of
          dementia, beginning with a general outline of the anthroposophical
          conception of the human being and society, and applying that knowledge
          to what today is increasingly referred to as an epidemic. This book
          does not demand medical expertise, but requires an effort to engage
          with the psycho-spiritual conditions of dementia sufferers. It
          provides a wealth of insights and guidance to approaching one of the
          greatest challenges of our time.
