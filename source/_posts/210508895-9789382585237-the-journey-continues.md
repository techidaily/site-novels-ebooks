            <strong>SRI M WAS BORN</strong> in Trivandrum Kerala in 1949. At the
            age of nine he had a strange encounter in the backyard of his house.
            Under the jackfruit tree he saw a matted-haired yogi. The yogi
            blessed him saying 'you will get to know our connection in time' and
            walked away.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            After this incident the mind of the young boy, born of Deccani
            Muslim parents, turned towards Vedanta and the great Indian
            tradition of yoga that led to deep contemplation. Meeting many known
            and unknown sages and yogis as if by design, Sri M at the age of 19
            left home and went off to the Himalayas. There, at the Vyasa Guha
            beyond Badrinath, he met the great yogi Sri Maheshwaranath Babaji
            belonging to the Nath sampradaya.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an apprentice to this great being, his mind underwent a profound
            transformation. Travelling with this bare-footed yogi, he had many
            wonderful experiences. A detailed account of his almost unbelievable
            experiences from childhood to the present can be found in Sri M's
            autobiography, Apprenticed to a Himalayan Master: A yogi's
            Autobiography.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            On the instructions of his master, he returned to the plains and
            lived incognito for a long time. Meanwhile, he got married and has
            two children who are themselves grownup and married now.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Sri M wears no grand robes, has no special hair style, is often
            found wearing jeans and T-shirt or dhothi and white shirt. He lives
            in Madanapalle, travels around the world conducting retreats and
            giving talks on yoga, Upanishads, Sufi teachings - in short, inner
            core of the religious traditions of most religions including the
            Jewish, the Christian, Buddhist and so on.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>He calls himself a practising yogi.</p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Sri M heads the Satsang Foundation which runs the Satsang Vidyalaya
            - a free school for the underprivileged and an IIC-ICSC boarding
            school called Peepal Grove School, a rural school in a remote
            village 20 kms from Madanapalle and a Swasthya Kendra - a free
            medical service for the poor.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            The Satsang Foundation has recently initiated the MYTHRI programme
            involving large scale re-forestation and is in the process of
            setting up a modern hospital to cater to the needy on the outskirts
            of Bangalore.
