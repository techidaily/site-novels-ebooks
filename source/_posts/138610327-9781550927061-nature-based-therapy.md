          <p>
            The number of children, youth, and families seeking help for a wide
            range of mental health concerns is growing at an alarming rate, and
            many struggle to thrive despite well-intentioned interventions from
            skilled helpers. Unplugging from technology and reconnecting with
            the web of life is a powerful antidote to the highly technological
            and fast-paced realities of so many.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nature-Based Therapy addresses this underlying disconnection between
            humans and their ecological home, exploring theories and therapeutic
            practices undertaken with children, youth, and families, including:
          </p>
          Developing sensory awareness of outer and inner landscapes Navigating
          risk in play Case examples with a diverse range of settings,
          intentions, and interventions.
          <p>
            Nature-Based Therapy is for counselors, therapists, youth and social
            workers, educators, and parents working in educational and
            therapeutic settings who want to take their practice beyond the
            office walls and into the powerful terrain of the wild, partnering
            with nature as a co-facilitator to create lasting change.
