          Combines cognitive psychology with Zen, Taoist, and Vedic practices to
          empty the mind<br /><br />• Explains how eliminating external
          stimulation can alleviate stress and anxiety for a calmer state of
          mind<br /><br />• Details meditation practices, such as open-awareness
          meditation, contemplation of Zen koans, and Vipassana meditation, and
          explores methods of digital detox <br /><br />• Draws on classical
          yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism as well as cognitive science to
          explain how and why to fast the mind<br /><br />Stop planning, stop
          comparing, stop competing, stop thinking, and just breathe deeply for
          a minute . . . Our undivided attention is something we are rarely able
          to give for reasons ranging from digital overload to the cultural
          conditioning of equating busyness with purpose. Just as you might
          choose a fast from eating to detoxify the body, the best way to
          overcome this modern mental overload is to periodically fast the
          mind.<br /><br />Drawing on the spiritual philosophies and meditative
          practices of classical yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism, Jason
          Gregory explains how fasting the mind directly impacts your habits and
          way of being in the world to create peace and calmness in your life as
          well as allow you to build a firm psychological defense against the
          increasing bombardment of distractions in our world. Applying
          psychology and cognitive science to samsara--the cycle of suffering
          created by our attachment to the impermanent--he explains how
          overreliance on the rational mind causes imbalances in the autonomic
          nervous system and suppresses our natural spontaneity, feelings, and
          intuition. When we are unable to relax the mind deeply, we enter a
          destabilizing state of stress and anxiety and are unable to liberate
          the true Self from the impermanence and limitations of the material
          world. Sharing Zen, Taoist, and Vedic practices to help you empty your
          mind and gradually restore your natural rhythms, the author shows how
          to give the mind time to truly relax from stimulation so it can repair
          itself and come back into equilibrium. He details simple meditation
          practices that are easy to implement in daily life, such as
          open-awareness meditation and contemplation of Zen koans, as well as
          the advanced techniques of Vipassana, a Theravadic Buddhist discipline
          centered on seclusion from all worldly stimuli. He also offers methods
          for digital detox and ensuring a good night’s sleep, a major support
          for healing cognitive impairment and restoring a state of
          equanimity.<br /><br />By fasting the mind we strip away the
          distractions and stresses of modern life and return to our original
          nature as it exists deep within. We become more consciously awake in
          every moment, allowing us to feel the real beauty of the world and, in
          turn, to live life more fully, authentically, and peacefully.

          “A mixture of modern-day science and astute scholarship gleaned from
          the ancient texts of wisdom cultures,
          <i>Fasting the Mind</i> contributes to the understanding of how the
          mind can be transformed from self-centeredness into an inseparable
          union with all that is . . . when consciousness lives with just what
          is. For the sake of all beings, we need to listen, ingest, and live
          this reality.”
