            Living "happily ever after" was a dream and hope of people
            throughout ages from young to old. It was an aspiration and a goal
            present in children's stories, religious beliefs, and hopeful
            wishes. We live in a time when scientific breakthroughs in medicine,
            biology, epigenetics, and other branches of science accumulated
            knowledge to convert the healthy, long-living dream into reality.
            Specifically, understanding the laws that govern the cells, tissue,
            and organs made possible this very bold statement that age--and, in
            the future, ultimately mortality--could be conquered. Those
            discoveries bring a lot of new challenges to the way we govern
            ourselves and the mindset in the culture we live in.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The understanding we had about diet, sleep, exercise, mental
            attitude, and risky behaviors are still very important and needed
            but not sufficient. The next barrier consists in reversing and
            stopping the process of aging. Aging is a very costly disease, and
            there is nothing desirable about any condition associated with aging
            or sickness. To live a long and sick life is a curse, not a
            blessing. We are striving for a healthy, long life, full of vigor,
            achievements, and excitements.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            This book explains the seven pillars that age and dying are resting
            on, and ways to prevent every one of them from manifesting. If we
            understand how we age and why, we can intervene at different points
            to prevent and break this cycle. The natural cell cycle of age and
            atrophy of cells is discussed. Different pathways that lead to
            cancers, "zombie" or senescent cells are discussed with ways to
            prevent them. Then the powerhouse of the cell is discussed in
            detail, with ways of strengthening and protecting it. This
            powerhouse is viewed by many scientists as the kernel where diseases
            do originate. Also, toxin accumulation inside the cells is
            discussed, with ways of helping the cells get rid of the overload.
            Toxin accumulation between the cells is discussed, as well as the
            relationship between the autoimmune disease and gut health.
            Different plant involvement in our health and diseases in the forms
            of lectins are also discussed.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            The space between cells and the health of some organs that do assist
            in the detoxification process are discussed, together with water
            roles.

            Aging could be conquered by a series of steps. It could be viewed as
            maintenance offered to a very valuable machinery. Some of the needed
            ingredients for the cells to function optimally, in the form of
            vitamins, minerals, polyphenols, amines, and other substances, are
            also given. Staying young and healthy does not consist in a magic
            pill. It consists of a series of steps taken daily that preserve and
            strengthen the cells. It is the habit of daily choices taken that
            confer excellent results.

            Excellence is never an accident. It is always the result of high
            intention, sincere effort, and intelligent execution. It represents
            the wise choice of many alternatives--choice not chance determines
            your destiny.
