          Numerous great thinkers have believed in the transmigration of the
          soul. General Patton, Gandhi, Henry Ford, the Dalai Lama, all
          discussed memories of, or beliefs in, having past lives. The great
          philosophers Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and even Saint
          Augustine believed in the rebirth of the soul. Awakening of a Warrior
          is the result of Jaco' s investigation— his treasure hunt— into the
          lifetimes he experienced before the present.Included are his lives as
          King Abimelech of Gerar, who allied with Abraham in the creation of a
          new religion called Judaism; Cyrus the Great, who unified all of
          Persia and implemented Zoroastrianism as the state religion; and
          Marcus Furius Camillus, who came to be considered the second founder
          of Rome.
