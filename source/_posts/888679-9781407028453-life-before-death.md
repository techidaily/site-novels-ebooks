            As Britain's leading psychic medium, perhaps it's not surprising
            that more than 200,000 people buy tickets every year to see Colin
            Fry's theatre tour up and down the country (and in New Zealand).
            It's also not surprising that his top-rating TV show,
            <i>6ixth Sense</i>, is now in its 7th series and continues to hold
            an average of 100,000 viewers per month. With such an enormous fan
            base, there is therefore huge interest in Colin Fry's first book,
            <i>Life Before Death.</i><br /><br />A compelling read, full of
            extraordinary stories from his life and work, it also investigates a
            theme which comes up time and again in his conversations with people
            who come to him for readings: how do you make the most of your time
            in <i>this </i>world. Colin Fry has a gift for being able to receive
            messages from souls in the spirit world. Remarkable, and fascinating
            as this is he feels strongly that the messages he receives should be
            used to help us maximise our life's potential.
            <i>Life Before Death</i> explains how he was able to develop his
            gift, and what being a psychic medium actually means. But it also
            gives advice on how to make better connections with your friends and
            family, how to be open to new things in life, how to both forgive
            and give more readily, and how to accept all that happens to you.
