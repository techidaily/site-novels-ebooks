            Dr. Tucker, in a follow-up to his book <i>Life Before Life</i>,
            explores American cases of young children who report memories of
            previous lives in the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller,
            <i>Return to Life</i>. <br /><br />A first-person account of Jim
            Tucker's experiences with a number of extraordinary children with
            memories of past lives, <i>Return to Life</i> focuses mostly on
            American cases, presenting each family's story and describing his
            investigation. His goal is to determine what happened—what the child
            has said, how the parents have reacted, whether the child's
            statements match the life of a particular deceased person, and
            whether the child could have learned such information through normal
            means. Tucker has found cases that provide persuasive evidence that
            some children do, in fact, possess memories of previous lives.
            <br /><br />Among others, readers will meet a boy who describes a
            previous life on a small island. When Tucker takes him to that
            island, he finds that some details eerily match the boy's statements
            and some do not. Another boy points to a photograph from the 1930s
            and says he used to be one of the men in it. Once the laborious
            efforts to identify that man are successful, many of the child's
            numerous memories are found to match the details of his life. Soon
            after his second birthday, a third boy begins expressing memories of
            being a World War II pilot who is eventually identified.
            <br /><br />Thought-provoking and captivating,
            <i>Return to Life </i>urges its readers to think about life and
            death and reincarnation, and reflect about their own consciousness
            and spirituality.

          “In <i>Return to Life</i>, Jim Tucker painstakingly and meticulously
          documents the recycling of memories from beyond the barrier of
          physical death. He then rigorously offers a scientific theory to
          explain how our consciousness transcends space/time and is, hence,
          eternal. This book is an important milestone of an emerging scientific
          paradigm that suggests that consciousness conceives governs constructs
          and becomes the universe or perhaps multiple universes.” —<i
            >Deepak Chopra</i
          ><br /><br />“A breezy page-turner...Tucker presents these
          cases...with professioanlism and palpable respect.” —<i
            >Spirituality and Health</i
          ><br /><br />“Jim Tucker is a worthy successor to Dr. Ian Stevenson.
          He approaches these fascinating cases of children who appear to
          remember previous lives with an intelligent curiosity, sober judgment,
          and a real knack for telling a story, which is a good thing, because
          these are great stories.” —<i
            >Tom Shroder, Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and author of Old
            Souls: Compelling Evidence from Children Who Remember Past Lives</i
          ><br /><br />“These incredible cases are not simply solid grounds for
          accepting some form of reincarnation into our Western worldview. These
          are heart-rending, poignant reminders that many of us do not quite
          'fit' into the cultural and religious worlds into which we are born.
          Obviously, we are more than these worlds. Way, way more.” —<i
            >Jeffrey J. Kripal, author of Authors of the Impossible: The Sacred
            and the Paranormal</i
          ><br /><br />“Researchers at the University of Virginia Medical
          School's Department of Perceptual Studies are studying reports from
          children around the world who claim to remember their past lives. More
          than 2,500 such reports have been analyzed by the Project's founder
          Ian Sevenson and several colleagues, among them Jim Tucker.Their work
          has immense implications for our understanding of the world and human
          nature, but has received relatively little attention from mainstream
          scientists and religious groups. <i>Return to Life</i>, like Dr.
          Tucker's previous book, <i>Life Before Life</i>, opens a door on this
          historic research. Even if you disagree with Tucker's brief
          speculations about the afterlife, you will get a good look at the kind
          of evidence for reincarnation that the University of Virginia team is
          assembling. It is astonishing to me that their work is not better
          known.” —<i
            >Michael Murphy, Founder and Chairman Emeritus, Esalen Institute,
            and co-author of God and the Evolving Universe</i
          ><br /><br />“<i>Return to Life </i>comes as a resounding wake-up call
          regarding human existence. For decades, materialists have insisted
          that consciousness is nothing more than a function or emergent
          property of the brain. But the fact is that scientifically, the
          origins and nature of consciousness and its role in nature remain a
          mystery. The greatest obstacle to illuminating these issues through
          scientific discovery is not ignorance, but the illusion that we
          already have the answers. The empirical evidence that Dr. Tucker
          presents in this book challenges the reductionistic, metaphysical
          beliefs of scientific materialism. If his research methods are flawed,
          the scientific community should bring this to his and the public's
          attention. If they are irreproachable, then the empirical facts he
          reveals compel us to reassess even our most fundamental assumptions
          about consciousness, human nature, and the universe at large.” —<i
            >B. Alan Wallace, Ph.D., President of the Santa Barbara Institute
            for Consciousness Studies and author of Dreaming Yourself Awake</i
          ><br /><br />“With <i>Return to Life</i>, Dr. Jim B. Tucker has driven
          a very large nail in the coffin of materialism. This is an important
          contribution to the growing body of evidence that consciousness
          survives the death of the brain and body. The fear of death and
          annihilation has caused more suffering in human history than all the
          physical diseases combined. This book is a powerful antidote to that
          dread.” —Larry Dossey, MD, author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind
          Is Part of a Great Consciousness and Why It Matters
