            ><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i> BESTSELLER • Thought leader, visionary,
            philanthropist, mystic, and yogi Sadhguru presents Western readers
            with a time-tested path to achieving absolute well-being: the
            classical science of yoga.</b

            reassurance of why and how we can.”—Sir Ken Robinson, author
            of&nbsp;<i>The Element, Finding Your Element,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i
              >Out of Our Minds: Learning to Be Creative</i
            ></b
          ><br /><br /><b
            >NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY
            <i>SPIRITUALITY &amp; HEALTH</i><br /></b
          ><br />The practice of hatha yoga, as we commonly know it, is but one
          of eight branches of the body of knowledge that is yoga. In fact, yoga
          is a sophisticated system of self-empowerment that is capable of
          harnessing and activating inner energies in such a way that your body
          and mind function at their optimal capacity. It is a means to create
          inner situations exactly the way you want them, turning you into the
          architect of your own joy.<br /><br />
          A yogi lives life in this expansive state, and in this transformative
          book Sadhguru tells the story of his own awakening, from a boy with an
          unusual affinity for the natural world to a young daredevil who
          crossed the Indian continent on his motorcycle. He relates the moment
          of his enlightenment on a mountaintop in southern India, where time
          stood still and he emerged radically changed. Today, as the founder of
          Isha, an organization devoted to humanitarian causes, he lights the
          path for millions. The term <i>guru, </i>he notes, means “dispeller of
          darkness, someone who opens the door for you. . . . As a guru, I have
          no doctrine to teach, no philosophy to impart, no belief to propagate.
          And that is because the only solution for all the ills that plague
          humanity is self-transformation. Self-transformation means that
          nothing of the old remains. It is a dimensional shift in the way you
          perceive and experience life.” <br /><br />The wisdom distilled in
          this accessible, profound, and engaging book offers readers
          time-tested tools that are fresh, alive, and radiantly new.
          <i>Inner Engineering </i>presents a revolutionary way of thinking
          about our agency and our humanity and the opportunity to achieve
          nothing less than a life of joy.

          <b>Praise for Sadhguru and <i>Inner Engineering</i></b
          ><br />
          <b>&nbsp;</b><br />
          “By any measure, Sadhguru is a remarkable man. For countless people
          around the world, he is a luminous spiritual guide. He is as well a
          pragmatic social activist and compassionate campaigner for human
          rights, for universal education, and for global peace and well-being.
          In this signature book, he sets out the personal experiences and deep
          insights that have transformed his own life and consciousness. More
          than that, he offers a practiced program for personal transformation
          that also draws from the venerable teachings of the yogic masters who
          continue to inspire him. Throughout the ages there have been no more
          insistent questions than 'Who are we?' and 'What is our purpose in
          living at all?' Contrarian and consistent, ancient and contemporary,
          <i>Inner Engineering</i> is a loving invitation to live our best lives
          and a profound reassurance of why and how we can.”<b
            >—Sir Ken Robinson, author of
            <i>The Element, Finding Your Element,</i> and
            <i>Out of Our Minds: Learning to Be Creative</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “I am inspired by Sadhguru’s capacity for joy, his exuberance for
          life, and the depth and breadth of his curiosity and knowledge. His
          book is filled with moments of wonder, awe, and intellectual
          challenge. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in
          self-transformation.”<b
            >—Mark Hyman, M.D., director, Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional
            Medicine, and <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “<i>Inner Engineering</i> is a fascinating read of Sadhguru’s insights
          and his teachings. If you are ready, it is a tool to help awaken your
          own inner intelligence, the ultimate and supreme genius that mirrors
          the wisdom of the cosmos.”<b>—Deepak Chopra</b>
