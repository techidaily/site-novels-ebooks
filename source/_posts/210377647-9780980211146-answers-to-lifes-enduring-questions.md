            ﻿﻿This book summarizes the explanations in three full-length books:
            Your Eternal Self: Science Discovers the Afterlife; There Is Nothing
            but Mind and Experiences; and Reasons for What Happens to You in
            Your Life &amp; Your Afterlife. The three books explain what we know
            today about the nature of reality, our purpose in this life, and
            what happens when we leave this life.
          </p>
          <p><strong>There Is Nothing but Mind and Experiences</strong></p>
          <p>
            This book explains that Our Universal Intelligence is the basis of
            reality, and we are individual manifestations of it. It explains why
            we know this is true and what it means for our life in Earth School.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Your Eternal Self: Science Discovers the Afterlife</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This book was developed and updated from the book Your Eternal Self.
            This book contains the evidence that our Minds are not in our
            brains, our Minds don't need the brain, and we continue to live
            after the brain dies.
          </p>

            <strong
              >Reasons for What Happens to You in Your Life &amp; Your
              Afterlife.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The third book, Reasons for What Happens to You in Your Life &amp;
            Your Afterlife: From Speakers in the Afterlife, explains what
            happens to us through the major stages of life: deciding to enter
            Earth School; planning the Earth School experience; learning to
            succeed in Earth School; growing in love, compassion, and
            understanding; graduating; and living in the life after this Earth
            School life.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Answers to Life's Enduring Questions</strong> contain
            explanations of these important truths:
          </p>
          Your Mind is not produced by or contained in your brain. Your Mind has
          body experiences and brain experiences but lives perfectly well
          without either.There is nothing but Mind and experiences. We
          experience the world, but the world does not exist outside of our
          Minds and experiences.Our Minds are individual manifestations of Our
          Universal Intelligence that all people are part of-we are all one
          Mind.Our one Universal Intelligence creates the world we live in based
          on humanity's history and our expectations for the scenery, such as
          mountains, oceans, a moon, and animals.Because we are Our Universal
          Intelligence, our individual Minds continue to live after the
          temporary Earth School body ceases to function.We have purposes for
          being in Earth School and can live in love, joy, and peace while we
          fulfill our purposes.We planned our lives in Earth School and play out
          the plan, although our free will can adjust and deviate from the plan
          at will.The reason for the death of the body is so we can end our
          Earth School experience and graduate to the next life.&nbsp;&nbsp;
