          Paganistan - a moniker adapted by the Twin Cities Contemporary Pagan
          community - is the title of a history and ethnography of a regionally
          unique, urban, and vibrant community in Minnesota. The story of the
          community traces the formation of some of the earliest organizations
          and churches in the US, the influence of publication houses and
          bookstores, the marketplace, and the local University, on the growth
          and sustenance of a distinct Pagan community identity, as well as
          discussions of the patterns of diversifying and cohesion that occur as
          a result of societal pressure, politics, and generational growth
          within it. As the first ever study of this long-lived community, this
          book sets out to document Paganistan as another aspect of the
          increasing prevalence of Paganism in the US and contributes to the
          discussion of the formation of new American religious communities.
          Revealing how canonical theories about community formation in
          anthropology do not always fit comfortably nor accurately describe how
          a vibrant Pagan community creates and sustains itself, this book will
          be of interest to scholars of religion and new religious movements
          worldwide, and offers a valuable contribution to discussions within
          both urban anthropology and sociology.

          "...a valuable study of contemporary religious life in America. It
          raises important questions about the consumerist pressures that also
          pose threats of disintegration to traditional Christian churches."

          "From the first evocative vignette of a meeting of diverse kinds of
          Pagans to the final reflections on the current state of the garden,
          Murphy Pizza’s discussion of Paganism in the Twin Cities (Saint Paul
          and Minneapolis) is eloquent and insightful. Whether Paganistan is
          unique or not may be debated, but certainly this book provides a
          fascinating development in the study of contemporary Paganism. It
          builds on engagement with one ever shifting experiment in late-modern
          community-building to provide a scholarly assessment that ought to
          inspire further research about other places and religions."

          "Murphy Pizza is a sensitive guide to the complex fluxes and flows of
          this diverse urban Pagan community. Her book has much to teach us
          about the improvisational creativity and particularities of place that
          shape contemporary Paganism as a spiritual identity as well as a
          public religion."

          "Paganistan packs some very interesting and important material ... it
          is a worthy contribution to the literature on Paganism, new religious
          movements, and religion in the widest sense."
        </p>
        <p>- <strong>Anthropology Review Database</strong></p>
        <p>
          "This sociological study is a welcome addition to the continual
          examination of the religiously unique tapestry of Minneapolis-St.
          Paul, a great northern city that has given rise to innovative new
          religious movements ... It is no surprise that a diverse neo-pan-Pagan
          group (which includes Wicca, Heathenry, ÃsatrÃº, Druids, etc.) that
          finds common ground in Paganistan should emerge and flourish in this
          region as well."
        </p>
        <p>- <strong>Catholic Books Review</strong></p>
        <p>
          "[Paganistan] is a strong piece of ethnography that can serve as a
          model for anthropology students seeking to ground the
          observational-participatory in current theory. Moreover, the text can
          serve as comparative material for future researchers."
