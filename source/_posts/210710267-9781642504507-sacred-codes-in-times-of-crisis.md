          <p>
            <b
              >Our day-to-day choices, made individually, affect our culture and
              societal structures as a whole. With this in mind,
              <i>Sacred Codes in Times of Crisis</i> guides you through an
              extraordinary program of self-realization and empowerment to
              access your creative potential and manifest your dreams.</b

          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Learn the art of true, conscious creation.</b> We spend our lives
            searching for things that we think will make our lives better, more
            abundant, loving and fulfilling. Yet, as we take part in our
            day-to-day busy lives, we often get sidetracked from our truest
            dreams and desires. Instead of creating the life that we have always
            dreamed of, we get lost in an endless series of events where we are
            often unprepared, reactionary, and less tolerant. In order to create
            with consciousness, to manifest our soul’s wishes into reality, we
            need to believe there is a greater part of ourselves that is able to
            guide us, so that we can live our dreams by loving ourselves
            unconditionally.<br />

              constantly changing world. </b
            >If we want to stay up to date in an accelerated technological
            world, we need to adapt and be willing and open to learning new ways
            of communicating and inter-relating with ourselves and the world
            around us.<br />
