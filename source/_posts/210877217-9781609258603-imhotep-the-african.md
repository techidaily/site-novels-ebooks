            >A bold study of the ancient Egyptian architect, high priest, and
            royal astronomer—and his influence as the true father of African
            civilization.</b
          ><br /><br />In this groundbreaking book, Egyptologist Robert Bauval
          and astrophysicist Thomas Brophy uncover the mystery of Imhotep, an
          ancient Egyptian superstar, pharaonic Da Vinci, Michelangelo, Galileo,
          and Newton all rolled into one. Based on their research at the Step
          Pyramid Complex at Saqqara, the book delves into observational
          astronomy to “decode” the alignments and other design features of the
          Step Pyramid Complex, to uncover the true origins and genius of
          Imhotep. Like a whodunit detective story, they follow the clues that
          take them on an exhilarating magical mystery tour starting at Saqqara,
          leading them to temples in Upper Egypt and to the stones of Nabta
          Playa and the black African stargazers who placed them there.<br /><br /><i
            >Imhotep the African</i
          >
          describes how Imhotep was the ancient link to the birth of modern
          civilization, restoring him to his proper place at the center of the
          birthing of Egyptian, and world, civilization.<br /><br /><b
            >Praise for <i>Imhotep the African</i></b
          ><br /><br />“An archaeological detective story. Bauval and Brophy
          make the case that the legendary Egyptian physician, architect, and
          astronomer Imhotep was not only an historical figure but that he was
          black. This remarkable book challenges many assumptions about life
          along the Nile, revealing a worldview and technology that was more
          sophisticated than anything previously imagined.” —Stanley Krippner,
          PhD, co-author of <i>Personal Mythology</i><br /><br />“It is evident
          to many of their colleagues that Robert Bauval and Thomas Brophy are
          the dynamic duo of independent Egyptologists. They are to be commended
          for their scholarship and their dogged determination to present an
          honest assessment of historical events—even if it flies in the face of
          conventional dogma.” —Anthony T. Browder, author and independent
          Egyptologist

          "Imhotep the African is an archaeological l detective story. Bauval
          and Brophy make the case that the legendary Egyptian physician,
          architect, and astronomer Imhotep was not only an historical figure
          but that he was black. This remarkable book challenges many
          assumptions about life along the Nile, revealing a worldview and
          technology that was more sophisticated than anything previously
          imagined." —Stanley Krippner, Ph.D., co-author of Personal
          Mythology<br /><br />"Bauval and Brophy have once again brought their
          keen intellectual and scientific skills to bear by examining an aspect
          of ancient history that contemporary Egyptologists have been either
          too afraid or too unwilling to investigate. Imhotep the African is the
          perfect sequel to Black Genesis, for it presents incontrovertible
          truths that will either be accepted on their merits or ignored for
          fear of exposing a house of lies built upon foundations of historical
          falsehoods. It is evident to many of their colleagues that Robert
          Bauval and Thomas Brophy are the dynamic duo of independent
          Egyptologists. They are to be commended for their scholarship and
          their dogged determination to present an honest assessment of
          historical events—even if it flies in the face of conventional dogma."
