        <div accordion-content="" id="description">
          Many of us have made our lives so noisy, overwhelming, sensory craving
          and data driven that we have somehow missed the most fundamental part
          about ourselves and our lives. Learning how to work with every
          process, every situation, every relationship intuitively; learning to
          love what is, to let go, to have faith and find stillness; to foster
          one’s intuition and become creative in our own lives is something we
          can all achieve. To illustrate these concepts, Hajlmarsson calls on
          her decades of experience and work as a psychotherapist. But most
          significantly, her life as an autism parent, accounted for in her
          previous books,<i> Finding Lina</i>&nbsp;2013 and
          <i>Beyond Autism </i>2019, which has taught her where to find that
          elusive freedom and harmony: inside herself. Hjalmarsson believes that
          the solution to life's chaos, this freedom and harmony—this love—is
          accessible to all. She writes, "We don’t earn freedom. We either
          realize who we are and how we can live free, connected, joyful and
          expansive lives or we don’t. We can realize it some of the time and
          live a little bit connected and a little bit trapped. Or we can learn
          to realize it most of the time and spend most of our lives fully
          awake."
