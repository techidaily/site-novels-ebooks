            <strong>Wake Up Your Intuition</strong>&nbsp;explains our connection
            to the source of all things, God, Creator, whatever your personal
            belief is. It helps the reader understand how this life on earth
            originates and is not accidental, but a plan. By engaging our
            thoughts and taking us to a deeper level, we are enabled to reckon
            with a greater and more spiritual universe than we ever could have
            imagined, while struggling to find our place in it. And by simply
            waking up, we suddenly realize that it has been there all along and
            for infinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book provides a step-by-step process for waking up and being
            aware of what is already part of us - we are all intuitive. By
            implementing the process of waking up and practicing the exercises
            in this book, we&nbsp;are&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;put to sleep that
            drive that&nbsp;is&nbsp;within us which keeps us searching for
            success and happiness. By its very nature, that internal drive only
            delays that for which&nbsp;it&nbsp;seeks; and once&nbsp;it
            is&nbsp;rendered powerless, our minds open to
            the&nbsp;vast&nbsp;realm of possibilities. Waking
            up&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;first&nbsp;step. Staying awake requires
            constant vigilance&nbsp;in&nbsp;our minds to keep the old habits and
            behaviors at&nbsp;bay.&nbsp;The exercises&nbsp;in&nbsp;the book
            and&nbsp;in&nbsp;this manual activate and galvanize our senses,
            sharpening them to the&nbsp;point&nbsp;where our mindfulness and
            clarity&nbsp;of&nbsp;our
            purpose&nbsp;become&nbsp;dominant&nbsp;forces&nbsp;in&nbsp;everything
            we do, say and think. That&nbsp;is&nbsp;the turning point when the
            things we want&nbsp;in life&nbsp;are naturally attracted to
            us,&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer&nbsp;have
            to&nbsp;drive&nbsp;ourselves&nbsp;in&nbsp;an elusive search
            for&nbsp;happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Waking up” happens to many people naturally and
            unexpectedly.&nbsp;In my own situation, I have been a student of
            natural healing, hypnosis and the physical and spiritual aspects of
            the mind for decades. I have known the principles of enlightenment
            for years. However, “knowing”, “being” and “staying” enlightened are
            two different things. One can “know” something
            is&nbsp;true,but&nbsp;must experience it in order to “be” it.
          </p>
          <p>
            My own recent experience with death has shown me the way to the true
            happiness of waking up and staying awake. Several months ago, I had
            been deeply involved in the affairs of both my personal life and my
            professional life. Being the mother of five children, I need not
            describe the complexities of my personal life. I knew the process
            and understood how to be awake....I fell short of understanding how
            to STAY AWAKE.&nbsp; Having a near death experience changed
            me.&nbsp; The things that were once important no longer were
            important to me. I was shown that the&nbsp;source of
            God&nbsp;is&nbsp;within us and&nbsp;was given was to “Teach people
            that we are one.”&nbsp; It is with great joy that I can share this
            book with you so that you too can live your life AWAKE.&nbsp;
