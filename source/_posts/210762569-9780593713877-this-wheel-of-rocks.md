            >The memoir of a Catholic nun’s spiritual journey that explores the
            deep connections between faith and the natural world</b
          ><br /><br />
          Growing up in the Midwest, Judy Grathwohl never felt she belonged. “I
          belong out west,” she remembers telling her father. After joining the
          Sisters of St. Francis in the early 1960s and becoming Sister Marya,
          she came to realize that she craved a life beyond the traditional path
          of a Catholic nun. “Something other than dedicating my life to God was
          summoning me, some other life purpose,” she writes.<br /><br />
          It took several years and several detours, but when Sister Marya
          eventually was assigned by her order to the Northwest, she felt an
          immediate connection to the place and to its Native people, the Crow
          and Northern Cheyenne. Little by little, she was invited to become
          part of their communities, to share their customs and rituals, and
          eventually was adopted into one of their families. She came to
          understand that the blending of Catholic teachings and Native
          traditions helped build within her a deeper respect for the Earth—this
          wheel of rocks—that she could not have built on her own.&nbsp;<br /><br />
          In this intimate, revelatory memoir, Sister Marya recounts her own
          spiritual journey, her settling in Montana, how she—a Catholic nun
          from Ohio—came to be embraced by the Crow and Northern Cheyenne, and
          how their traditions prompted in her an expanding devotion to the
          land, its resources, and its connections to faith and God.<br /><br />
          Honest and eye-opening, funny and heartfelt,
          <i>This Wheel of Rocks</i> shows how living a spiritual life committed
          to preserving nature and community can be both fulfilling and
          productive.

          <b>Praise for <i>This Wheel of Rocks</i>:<br /></b><br />“I predict
          that the shining knowledge and insights inside these pages will blow
          your soul wide awake in ways you can scarcely imagine. Woven into the
          lyric prose are forty years of learning among Native Americans, Earth
          activists, cosmologists and scientists, spiritual seekers, and Earth
          herself—even her rocks on mountains that seem far too harsh for life.”
          —<b>Sister Helen Prejean, author of <i>Dead Man Walking</i></b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Sister Marya’s memoir is as compelling as a novel, bringing the
          reader into the lives of Native people who helped her transform her
          understanding of our relationship with Earth. The prose is clear and
          lovely, and the voice is instantly trustworthy.” —<b
            >Denny LeBoeuf, Director, ACLU John Adams Project</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “This is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time.
          Sister Marya invites us into her fascinating spiritual journey. With
          engaging stories she shares her questions and struggles as well as her
          emerging insights and integration. This is a life-changing book to be
          savored for years to come.” —<b
            >Mary Evelyn Tucker, Yale University, co-author of </b
          ><i><b>Journey of the Universe</b><br /></i><br />“Marya Grathwohl’s
          story compels readers to probe their own life journey more deeply. Her
          vivid prose and poetic descriptions inspire and challenge us to live
          in harmony with all Creation.” —<b>Sister Claire Whelan, OSF</b>
