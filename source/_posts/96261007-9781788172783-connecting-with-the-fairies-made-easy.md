            >An introductory book on connecting with the mystical, magical world
            of the Fairies.</b
          ><br /><br />In parallel with our world is another ancient and
          mystical realm which holds the answers to the imbalance we see in our
          modern, fractured society. This is the realm of the Fairies. In
          Connecting with the Fairies Made Easy, readers who feel a deep bond
          with the natural world will learn to reconnect with the old ways of
          the Fairies to restore balance and harmony in their lives.
          <br /><br />Fairies are nature spirits and the guardian angels of the
          natural world. Flavia Kate Peters - known as the Faery Seer -has been
          communing with them since childhood and is a wisdom keeper of the
          fairy realm. In this book, she shares where to find fairies and how to
          communicate with them through spells, meditations, invocations and
          magical ceremonies. She leads the reader through unique exercises such
          as Fire Scrying, Moon Bathing and Fairy Circling. Having communicated
          with many different kinds of fairies, she explains the differences
          between them - from gnomes and sylphs to salamanders and undines - and
          what their roles are in the natural world. <br /><br />For those new
          to the Fairy realm, this book is an essential resource to help them
          reopen the gates to the mystical world of the Fairies.<br /><br />This
          title was previously published within the Hay House Basics series.
