          This extraordinary book includes a broad spectrum of information that
          is focused into an easy-to-understand single best source on the
          Afterlife. "Death cannot separate us." Unlike all other books on this
          topic, The Definitive Book of the Afterlife introduces an astonishing
          new way of looking at the Afterlife. It is very different and profound
          - a true documentary that shares in-depth information and detailed
          experiences of dying, death, transition, and existence in the
          Afterlife - actual experiences!" In the very early stages of writing
          The Definitive Book on the Afterlife, Marshall Smith unexpectedly
          passed away through a tragic accident. However, he continued to
          contribute to the book by sharing his personal experiences of dying,
          death, and the Afterlife. Patricia Hayes, highly experienced in
          communicating with those in the Afterlife, and having shared this
          process with Marshall for three decades, documented over a hundred
          communications with Marshall who, now in the Afterlife, provided
          detailed information that greatly influenced the content and direction
          of this book. The information about the Afterlife conveyed in this
          book comes from Patricia Hayes' decades of first-hand experience with
          helping others to cross over, and with her frequent communication not
          only with her husband, but also with her brother, Fred. She shares
          intimate details of Marshall's dying, including his moment of death,
          transition, and acclimation to the Afterlife - intimate details that
          are made possible through their deep love and dedication to their
          personal and working relationship. Using Marshall's observations and
          understanding of his existence in the Afterlife, Patricia draws
          comparisons between the physical levels of consciousness and the
          levels of consciousness in the Afterlife, so that you will know what
          to expect and how to function. Practical and easy-to-understand, you
          discover what the transition process is like, how the Earth and
          Afterlife are intertwined, how to determine your place in the
          Afterlife, and, most important, how to communicate with your loved
          ones who are in the Afterlife while you are still here on Earth. The
          Definitive Book on the Afterlife transcends religious views of dying
          to share first-hand, direct experience with the process of dying and
          death, as well as the realities of being in the Afterlife. One thing
          is for sure -- you will never look at dying and death the same way
          again. Inspirational, transformative, comforting, reassuring - it is a
          must read!
