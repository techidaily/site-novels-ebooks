          Although the word 'psychology' does not come up in this book, this
          early work by Osho shows his deep understanding of the subject and his
          attempt to make the connection between meditation and a modern
          understanding of psychology that includes the importance that our
          minds play in determining and giving direction, on many levels, to our
          lives. <br /><br />Osho has taught for many years that meditation is
          not a religious exercise but a scientific method to understand what
          the mind is, and how it works, and to learn how to create a healthy
          distance from what is, in many ways, a programmed and robot-like
          mechanism that seems to be dominating our lives and decisions and
          activities more and more – and not always in a positive way.
          <br /><br />As Osho has said so often, beginning many decades ago -
          that humanity is afflicted by a deep and fundamental insanity, and
          that we initiate each new generation of children into that madness -
          is now becoming more and more obvious. <br /><br />The children who
          refuse to be initiated into that madness will appear rebellious or mad
          to their elders, who persist with the best intentions to force them
          onto the same path, to participate in the same madness. "It is utterly
          dangerous to be sane in this world," Osho says. "A sane person has to
          pay a heavy price for his sanity."<br /><br />Osho pleads in this book
          for what he calls an independent mind, independent thinking – and
          challenges us to question our belief that we are already great
          independent minds, a belief based on the lack of understanding that
          our thoughts mostly come from others, like a computer program full of
          malware downloaded into our brains. <br />
          <br />"What I mean by the thinking state is that you should have eyes,
          what I mean is the ability to think on your own. But I don't mean a
          crowd of thoughts. We all have a crowd of thoughts within us, but we
          don't have thinking within us. So many thoughts go on moving within
          us, but the power of thinking has not been awakened." <br /><br />In
          his early days of teaching Osho ran meditation camps in which he
          introduced people into meditation, and his morning and evening talks
          created the framework of understanding for this work. This book is a
          fascinating record of one of these camps – in a short period of three
          days Osho introduces his participants to an understanding that our
          minds are running on malware programs – and he introduces meditation
          as an antivirus to clean our minds of the conditionings and
          indoctrinations that are preventing us from realizing our full
          potential and to be happy.<br /><br />“In the coming three days I will
          talk to you about the search for life…I must first say that life is
          not what we understand it to be. Until this is clear to us, and we
          recognize in our hearts that what we think of as life is not life at
          all, the search for the true life cannot begin.” <br /><br />“When you
          have something authentically your own in your mind, you start moving
          toward the soul. Then you become worthy, then you are able to know the
          soul. Until you have an independent mind, it is simply impossible for
          individuality to be born.”
