            An inspiring story about how one woman changed her father’s life
            with an email.
          </p>
          <p>
            As your daughter I urge you to please take these words to heart. In
            the future, I will not support you in doing any more of your shaming
            towards women or anyone, so if you call me for that, I will not
            oblige.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Susie Herrick, a licensed psychotherapist then in her thirties,
            found herself emotionally and spiritually stuck in her relationships
            with the men in her life, she began an extraordinary journey toward
            her own enlightening experiences and toward the powerful insight
            that she ultimately helped deliver to her father.
          </p>
          <p>
            That journey took her to the Himalayas; an encounter with a clawing
            eagle; an understanding of the state that Tibetan Buddhists call a
            bardo; the wisdom of the female teachers she met; and back—her raw
            inner world exposed as she navigates a difficult divorce. All of
            this results in Herrick's realization that how she had been treating
            herself was how her father had treated her mother. This transformed
            her life—as well as her father's.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the change in the way her father related to the women in his
            life inspired Herrick to share in this book—beautifully illustrated
            by the talented artist and designer Elle Luna—the lessons she
            learned so that she could help women examine their own life stories,
            take their own journeys, and empower them to speak with their own
            authentic voices.

          "A fascinating story written by a woman who has faced great challenges
          and obstacles, and has had the temerity, courage, and resilience to
          come out the other side…. I strongly encourage other women to read
          this book to gain inspiration and joy to incorporate into their own
          lives."
