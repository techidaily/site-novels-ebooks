            Two thousand years ago, the Biblical time, was a time of great
            change.&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus and those closest to him were inspiring in
            their ability to tap into their inner radiant light to navigate a
            challenging period of chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Over time, their heroic and heart warming stories have been cloaked
            in shadows…
          </p>
          <p>… Until now.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Through the past life journeys of eight souls,&nbsp;Shrouded
            Truth&nbsp;unveils the dramatic adventures and emotional experiences
            of those closest to Jesus,&nbsp;in a quest to unravel false
            entanglements whilst pursuing a path of spiritual purity.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Backed by tradition and documentary evidence, discover little known
            information that will challenge previously held beliefs about the
            Biblical Era, answer some questions and raise a few new ones.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Explore revelations that inspire the recognition and embodiment of
            our own radiant light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shrouded Truth&nbsp;is the first book in the
            <strong>Radiant Light Series, </strong>which&nbsp;&nbsp;helps us to
            explore of the true relationship between the spirit of man and the
            spirit of the God.&nbsp;&nbsp;It challenges us to look deeply into
            our inner core to illuminate the biggest shrouded truth of them all
            - our own radiant divinity.

          Shrouded Truth&nbsp;is a unique, highly recommended Biblical study
          that should be included in any serious historical and cultural
          examination of Jesus' life and times…and is a highly recommended pick
          for Biblical scholars from novices to advanced thinkers.– Midwest Book

          Thousands of books have been written about Jesus’ life. But few are
          from the viewpoint&nbsp;of those who may have lived during his
          lifetime ... open-minded Christians and believers in reincarnation
          will find much to ponder in this intriguing book. - Blue Ink Reviews

          "An intriguing book in which Biblical history has been re-explored in
          a fascinating and astounding manner through the regression technique.
          The author has gone further to improve our understanding of the
          connection between God and man. A must read."

          “Reena Kumarasingham connects the dots between the story of Jesus
          Christ as we know it from the bible to her experiences as a Past Life
          Regression Therapist through clients who are regressed to past lives
          in the time of Jesus Christ and recount fascinating details that shed
          light on life and events two millennia ago. An intriguing read for
          anyone interested in religion and open-minded enough to read about
          past lives, or those who are interested in past lives and are
          open-minded enough to read about religion’s origins.”

          Shrouded Truth challenges the reader to consider whether this changes
          his or her own viewpoint of that critical point in our history. A very
          interesting read.
