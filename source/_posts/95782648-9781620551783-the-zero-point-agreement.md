          A practical guide to stop searching for meaning by creating meaning
          from within <br />
          <br />• Explains how we can only discover who we are by naming what we
          want to be and taking steps to make it a reality <br />
          <br />• Offers simple evidence-based methods to generate enthusiasm,
          creativity, and direct spiritual experience and to co-create with the
          natural world as our ancestors did <br />
          <br />• Presents 11 core principles for living life from within, such
          as how to take full responsibility for motivation and effort, express
          gratitude, and focus your intention <br />
          <br />Everyone wants to experience purpose and inspiration in their
          lives, but the search for meaning often leaves a seeker in the hands
          of fate. Offering a different approach to self-discovery, one where we
          create our meaning from within rather than seek it from the outside
          world, Julie Tallard Johnson shows there is a science behind personal
          spiritual experiences and creativity. She reveals simple
          evidence-based methods that can be applied to any situation to
          generate enthusiasm, inspiration, and direct spiritual experience and
          transform the inner and outer landscapes of your life. <br />
          <br />Drawing from the Heart Sutra, the I Ching, indigenous wisdom,
          and the teachings of the Dalai Lama, Joseph Campbell, and the Kadampa
          master Atisha, Johnson outlines a practice centered on what she calls
          the Zero Point Agreement--the realization that you are the zero point
          of your life, that life’s purpose comes from within. She explains how
          to discover who you truly are by naming what you want to be and taking
          steps to make it a reality. Providing 11 core principles for the Zero
          Point Agreement as well as thought exercises, meditations, and
          journaling practices, Johnson shows how to break free from negative
          habitual states, liberate yourself from your attachment to the
          behaviors of others, take full responsibility for motivation and
          effort, express gratitude, focus your intention, and learn to
          co-create with the natural world. She also explores how to transform
          repressed material and how to apply the Zero Point Agreement to heal
          both personal and global relationships. <br />
          <br />Revealing how we can tap in to the creative, creational power
          that lies within and around each of us, Johnson offers a spiritual
          technology for self-illumination, creative restructuring of your life,
          and manifestation of your life’s purpose.

          “I love that the big beautiful zero is a central tenet of this book.
          What I see is a big round open door through which we can all walk on
          our journey toward wholeness. It’s a journey with no destination, of
          course, since wholeness is not a place as much as a perspective,
          ever-shifting. Put on your dancing shoes; this is not a book to be
          read propped up in your La-Z-Boy!”
