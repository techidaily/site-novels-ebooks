            >The bestselling author uses Wiccan sacred texts to show how we can
            have a more intimate connection with our surroundings.</b
          ><br /><br />From time immemorial, artists and poets, prophets, and
          shamans have drawn strength and inspiration from walking the earth.
          In&nbsp;<i>The Earth Path,</i>&nbsp;bestselling author Starhawk takes
          the reader on a journey into the heart of the natural world, showing
          how we can have a more intimate connection with the world that
          surrounds us.<br /><br />Institutionalized religions have sacred
          texts—messages written in holy books that are the inspiration for
          their beliefs and rituals. But the sacred texts for Wicca, like other
          ancient native or indigenous traditions, are written in nature—in the
          magic circle of the elements: air, fire, water, and earth.
          With&nbsp;<i>The Earth Path,</i>&nbsp;Starhawk, an activist,
          ecofeminist, and leader in the women’s spirituality movement, places
          you in the center of that magical circle. As you become attuned to the
          rhythms of the earth, your thinking will shift from focusing on
          isolated objects to marveling at the multitude of interconnecting
          patterns and relationships in nature. These patterns and connections
          can hold the key to your own spiritual renewal and restore your sense
          of responsibility for preserving this world that nurtures and sustains
          us.<br /><br />Filled with awareness exercises, inspiring meditations,
          and magical rituals,&nbsp;<i>The Earth Path</i>&nbsp;not only teaches
          the reader to respect the ecology of our natural world, but shows how
          to spiritually connect with and channel the powers inherent in
          nature.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>The Earth Path</i></b
          ><br /><br /><b
            >“Starhawk presents an array of exercises and practices for
            sharpening observation and listening skills. She engages readers’
            spirits and minds through her illustrative storytelling, offering
            ways to communicate more fully with the world and suggesting ways to
            act.” —<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b
          ><br /><br /><b
            >“Lucid, appealing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a broad philosophy of harmony
            with nature, of human concord, sexual liberation, creativity, and
            healthy pleasure, as expressed and celebrated in a freewheeling
            worship of the universe.” —<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b
