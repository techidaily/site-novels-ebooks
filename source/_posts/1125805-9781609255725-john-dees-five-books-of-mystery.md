            Discovered in a hidden compartment of an old chest long after his
            death, the secret writings of John Dee, one of the leading
            scientists and occultists of Elizabethan England, record in minute
            detail his research into the occult. Dee concealed his treatises on
            the nature of humankind's contact with angelic realms and languages
            throughout his life, and they were nearly lost forever. In his brief
            biography of John Dee, Joseph Peterson calls him a "true Renaissance
            man"-- detailing his work in astronomy, mathematics, navigation, the
            arts, astrology, and the occult sciences. He was even thought to be
            the model for Shakespeare's Prospero.
          </p>
          All this was preparation for Dee's main achievement: five books,
          revealed and transcribed between March 1582 and May 1583, bringing to
          light mysteries and truths that scholars and adepts have been
          struggling to understand and use ever since. These books detail his
          system for communicating with the angels, and reveal that the angels
          were interested in and involved with the exploration and colonization
          of the New World, and in heralding in a new age or new world order.
          While Dee's influence was certainly felt in his lifetime, his
          popularity has grown tremendously since. His system was used and
          adapted by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and subsequently by
          Aleister Crowley.
