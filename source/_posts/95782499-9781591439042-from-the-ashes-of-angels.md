          Provides convincing evidence that angels, demons, and fallen angels
          were flesh-and-blood members of a giant race predating humanity,
          spoken of in the Bible as the Nephilim. <br /><br />• Indicates that
          the earthly paradise of Eden was a realm in the mountains of
          Kurdistan. <br /><br />• By the author of Gateway to Atlantis.
          <br /><br />Our mythology describes how beings of great beauty and
          intelligence, who served as messengers of gods, fell from grace
          through pride. These angels, also known as Watchers, are spoken of in
          the Bible and other religious texts as lusting after human women, who
          lay with them and gave birth to giant offspring called the Nephilim.
          These religious sources also record how these beings revealed
          forbidden arts and sciences to humanity--transgressions that led to
          their destruction in the Great Flood. <br /><br />Andrew Collins
          reveals that these angels, demons, and fallen angels were
          flesh-and-blood members of a race predating our own. He offers
          evidence that they lived in Egypt (prior to the ancient Egyptians),
          where they built the Sphinx and other megalithic monuments, before
          leaving the region for what is now eastern Turkey following the
          cataclysms that accompanied the last Ice Age. Here they lived in
          isolation before gradually establishing contact with the developing
          human societies of the Mesopotamian plains below. Humanity regarded
          these angels--described as tall, white-haired beings with viperlike
          faces and burning eyes--as gods and their realm the paradise wherein
          grew the tree of knowledge. Andrew Collins demonstrates how the
          legends behind the fall of the Watchers echo the faded memory of
          actual historical events and that the legacy they have left humanity
          is one we can afford to ignore only at our own peril.

          "Tracking down angels both heavenly and fallen, Collins’s detective
          work takes him through entire libraries. . . . His conclusion is that
          we humans are not the first race to live on the planet. Reading books
          like this one can be as much fun as reading Conan Doyle or Agatha
          Christie."
