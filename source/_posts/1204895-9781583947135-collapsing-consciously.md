          A collection of probing essays and weekly meditations, this book
          addresses how to prepare emotionally and spiritually for the impending
          collapse of industrial civilization. Author Carolyn Baker offers
          wisdom, inspiration, and a sense of spiritual purpose for anyone who
          is concerned about the daunting future humankind has created.<br /><br />The
          author's introduction to&nbsp;<i>Collapsing Consciously</i
          >&nbsp;articulates our current predicament of economic collapse,
          environmental degradation, and global conflict and expresses the
          confusion, anxiety, grief, anger, and despair we all experience when
          we take a hard look at the present-day global crisis and the likely
          future of the planet. But rather than showing us ways to prevent the
          collapse, Baker argues that the demise of our consumerist, corporate
          culture is inevitable, and that it is crucial to prepare emotionally
          and spiritually for the certain changes to come.<br /><br />Part 1 is
          a collection of seventeen essays which argue that while the collapse
          of industrial society cannot be prevented, its meaning extends far
          beyond tragedy and loss. These essays ask the reader to delve inward
          and discover the limitless treasures of the soul, as well as the
          gratification and exhilaration to be discovered in joining with
          community in preparing for the future.<br /><br />In part 2, Baker
          offers fifty-two weekly meditations comprised of spiritual wisdom,
          inspiration, paradox, comfort, humor, irony, and a persistent
          challenge to create and savor beauty in the world, regardless of how
          bleak the future may appear.<br /><br /><i>Collapsing Consciously</i
          >&nbsp;is a refreshing take on the perilous present and the grim
          prospects for our future. Instead of quoting discouraging statistics
          about our predicament, Baker offers a deeper perspective that makes
          sense of a world that most of the time appears psychotic or even
          surreal. Through inspiration and perennial wisdom she has created a
          manual for making meaning and generating joy, especially in situations
          that feel hopelessly devoid of both.<br /><br />An ebook containing
          additional meditations is also available:&nbsp;<i
            >Collapsing Consciously Meditations: Further Reflections for
            Turbulent Times</i

          "In a world where the politicians and salesmen are practically
          indistinguishable, where profit is the prime directive, never mind
          morality or costs to the innocent and underprivileged, I’m grateful
          and glad for books like this one, which are excellent guides to
          changing one’s personal stake from attainment and accomplishment to
          belonging and sharing."—Zack Kopp,<i> Denver Books Examiner</i>

        <p>
          "I also believe this one book to be the single most powerful book I
          have read in the past decade, in relation to focusing my soul so as to
          better focus my mind and body." —Robert David Steele, author of<i>

          "I recommend <i>Collapsing Consciously</i>, especially for the very
          large number of people who have avoided the topic of collapse or the
          process of personal introspection." —Guy McPherson, author of
          <i>Going Dark<br /></i><br />"Carolyn Baker’s new book&nbsp;<i
            >Collapsing Consciously: Transformative Truths for Turbulent
            Times</i
          >&nbsp;is a breath of sanity in a world gone mad. Her contemplations
          are like a much needed multi-vitamin for the psyche that the deeper
          field of consciousness has secreted so as to compensate our madness.
          The fact that a book like&nbsp;<i>Collapsing Consciously</i>&nbsp;has
          arrived in our midst at this time of multiple world crises is evidence
          that our species is beginning to awaken from our self-created
          nightmare." —Paul Levy, author of&nbsp;<i
            >Dispelling Wetiko: Breaking the Curse of Evil</i
          >&nbsp;<br /><br />"Carolyn Baker’s Collapsing Consciously:
          Transformative Truths for Turbulent Times is perhaps the most
          approachable book on&nbsp;collapse&nbsp;you are likely to
          find.”—Dmitry Orlov, author of
          <i>Reinventing Collapse:The Soviet Example and American Prospects</i
          ><br /><br />“Carolyn Baker presents a no-denial appraisal of the
          global dark night that our species has created.&nbsp;Even in a time of
          collapse she finds room to talk wisely about joy, and to ask what
          despair has to teach us.&nbsp;Baker is a truth teller who dares us to
          go deeper into the night rather than to flee from it with superficial
          happy talk.&nbsp;I praise her for this very useful and very real book
          of rich meditations and practices.” —Matthew Fox, co-author, with Adam
          Bucko, of
          <i>Occupy Spirituality: A Radical Vision for a New Generation</i
          ><br /><br />"Carolyn Baker is an outstanding guide to sustaining and
          even enhancing our emotional and spiritual vitality as we navigate the
          disintegration of the world as we've known it." —Bill Plotkin, author
          of <i>Soulcraft</i><br /><br />“This is a book that most definitely
          needs to be read. It is crucial for us to ponder Carolyn Baker's
          profound and indispensable exposé of industrial civilization’s future.
          Her words are powerful and her wisdom rich and supportive. We need to
          seriously reflect on her message if we are to midwife a spiritual
          vision of life based on compassion, justice and solidarity.”<br />
          —<b> </b>Chris Saade, author of the upcoming
          <i>Second Wave Spirituality: Passion for Peace, Passion for Justice</i
          ><br /><br />“<i
            >Collapsing Consciously: Transformative Truths for Turbulent Times </i
          >is one of those books that is not meant to gather dust. It is a book
          you will want to keep close—in your glove box or in your pocket.
          Within a year you will see it get dog-eared, and it will become one of
          your best friends and companions as we all share and experience the
          shift into a new era of existence.” —Michael Ruppert, author
          of&nbsp;<i>Confronting Collapse</i><br /><br />“With this collection
          of essays and words of true wisdom, Carolyn Baker shows that she is
          truly one of the very best ports in the impending storm.” —Keith
          Farnish, author of <i>Time’s Up</i><br /><br />“Carolyn Baker is one
          of the few visionaries willing to take an unflinching look at the
          horrendous environmental, social, and economic situation we
          collectively find ourselves in—and also offer constructive day-by-day
          psychological and spiritual guidance for living a joyful life in the
          face of the escalating collapse of industrial society.” —Linda
          Buzzell, co-editor of&nbsp;<i>Ecotherapy<br /><br /></i>“Kudos,
          Carolyn Baker! De-riddling paradoxes, lighting up convergences, you
          walk with the Shadows through the Valley of Jung, to show how kindred
          spirits working together may evolve a better, saner, more healthful
          world out of the madness and detritus that envelops us now.” —Gary
          Corseri, author of&nbsp;<i>Holy Grail, Holy Grail</i><br /><br />“No
          one writes like Carolyn Baker about the crisis of our time. Her fierce
          wisdom is an essential guide to our survival, and the courage with
          which she writes will excite and inflame your heart.”—Andrew Harvey<br /><br />“Carolyn
          Baker knows that people tend to define a comfort zone in which they
          feel competent, and then to get bored even as they feel secure. She
          encourages not warding stuff off but experiencing it fully, and
          venturing out to encounter more of the mystery. Her main vision is
          that, in the course of growing up, humans will construct, sooner or
          later, a better society, and in any case will live intensely in the
          present.”<br />—Craig K. Comstock, book creation coach, former
          foundation director, and author
