            SUBLIME UNION presents Mary Magdalene's teaching on sexuality as
            only she can give it, founded in the ancient Egyptian temple of
            Isis. This best-selling book weaves together Mary's guidance on
            sacred sexuality with the author's deeply personal story of applying
            Mary's teachings with her partner. Through the lens of Kirkel's
            moving real-life account, SUBLIME UNION becomes both a sacred
            sexuality manual and erotic memoir.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Building on the messages in MARY MAGDALENE BECKONS, readers are now
            given the second key piece for uniting the Feminine and Masculine.
            Mary's path of sacred sexuality is completely explained, including
            23 illustrations.&nbsp;A clear and vulnerable guide to engaging
            intimacy as a spiritual path.
