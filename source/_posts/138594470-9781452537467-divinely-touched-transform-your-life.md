            <i>Divinely Touched</i> is a story of personal transformation. It
            chronicles Marys spiritual awakening, how she was divinely saved,
            led, and transformed. From the depths of depression, from battles
            with physical ailments for which the medical profession had no
            explanations, from being led into worlds she never knew existed, she
            survived being taken to the underworld. She was guided and healed by
            light workers, shamans, and avatars from this world and the spirit
            dimension and led on a journey of personal, physical, mental, and
            spiritual healing. Marys experience, like that of a caterpillar when
            transformed into a beautiful butterfly, is one that will inspire,
            enlighten, and transform your life as well. Dr. Dave uses science,
            research, and knowledge of the ages to explain what Mary experienced
            and open worlds to the reader that they may never have imagined.
            <i>Divinely Touched: Transform Your Life</i> can, in fact, do just
            that.

            With painstaking detail, Mary describes her descent into darkness
            and her triumphant return. Like Margaret Starbird, in The Goddess in
            the Gospels, who also has a spiritual awakening that took her into
            the realms of psychosis, Mary describes a similar personal descent
            into darkness before bursting forth into spiritual awareness. Inside
            you will find a compelling story that may help you or someone you
            love.<br />

            Are the Genie in the Bottle

          <p>
            The world is waiting for this powerful story of good vs. evil. Marys
            story is amazing, compelling, eye-opening, and courageous. Her faith
            has carried her through the darkness into the light. She is Gods
            instrument and truly a living expression of divine light flowing
            forth into the world. <i>Divinely Touched</i> is a must-read, and
            you wont want to put it down. It will blow your mind!<br />

            Marys amazing story will capture your interest and touch your heart.
            You will be inspired to move forward on your own journey of
            awakening.<br />

            Divinely Touched is a wonderful book that documents an impassioned
            and heartfelt account of the pitfalls and triumphs of personal
            awakening.<br />
