              >Love for the Future: Building One World of Freedom and Democracy
              Under God’s Truth</i
            >
            is a compilation of select international lectures given by Ryuho
            Okawa during his (ongoing) global missionary tours. While
            conflicting values of justice exists, this book espouses that
            freedom and democracy are vital principles for global unification
            that will resolutely foster peace and shared prosperity, if adopted
            universally. The culminating reason – these principles are based on
            a belief in God’s Love and that we all contain divine nature
            within.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapter 1 of Part 1 introduces Okawa’s lecture and Q&amp;A session
            in Germany, held in October 2018. Okawa conveys that the time is now
            to liberate all remorseful memories of 20th-century totalitarianism
            mired by the acts of the German Reich, and to band together to
            stifle the present-day totalitarian-communist superpower from
            mercilessly violating human rights and advancing hegemonism
            throughout the world. This is a crucial step to arresting global
            aggression from escalating into World War III. To address the global
            problems that we currently face, Okawa identifies what God seeks
            humanity to accomplish in the 21st century from a historical,
            political, and ultimately a religious perspective. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapter 2 is based on Okawa’s 2011 Hong Kong address and Q&amp;A
            session. In this lecture, Okawa encouraged the 1.4 billion people of
            China to strive for freedom-based prosperity and for the citizens of
            Hong Kong to champion this crucial movement. Okawa’s insight became
            the foundation on which the people of Hong Kong organized their
            democratization movement the Umbrella Revolution, which occurred
            several years later. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapter 3 is a transcription of Okawa’s 2019 lecture and Q&amp;A
            session held in Taiwan. In it, Okawa identifies the three signs of a
            totalitarian country and articulates the importance of spreading the
            principles of freedom, democracy, and faith from Taiwan to mainland
            China. This, he says,
            <i
              >is the righteous future in the eyes of God that will help to
              bring happiness to the people of mainland China</i
            >. Furthermore, Okawa encourages neighboring countries to overcome
            past grievances and seek prosperous development based on trust and
            adulation. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            Part 2 reveals the national and global strategies of four key world
            leaders: Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Angela Merkel, and Donald
            Trump. By accessing their hidden consciousnesses, through his
            unrivaled spiritual ability, Okawa divulges their true thoughts and
            intentions. What they candidly reveal underscores the importance of
            understanding and accepting the precepts expressed in Part 1, to
            safeguard peace from actions that are influenced by divisive
            political maneuverings. <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            The new catalyst for humanity is to accept the universal spiritual
            Truths under which we all live: the inherent dignity of all people;
            God’s Wisdom can resolve global conflict; God’s Love extends to
            every person, beyond difference of race, nationality and religious
            ideology. Through these teachings, readers will sense from the
            depths of their souls, that the “Love of God,” a universal force
            that watches over politics, philosophes and religions, is the
            coalescing power to lead humanity towards a prosperous and righteous
            tomorrow.
