          movement of the celestial bodies.<br />
          &nbsp;<br /><b

            your star sign</b
          >
          (although this is your most powerful time to shine!). Divided into the
          12 zodiac signs and detailing every major astrological event, follow
          the planets and zodiac signs as they shift throughout the year, and
          learn how to <b>live your best life</b> in every sign, from earthy

          <b>practicing astrologer</b>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Discover more about planetary movements such as mercury in retrograde,
          and explore what it means, how to use it to your advantage, and what
          to focus on. Allow this almanac to guide you as it tells you, based on
          the movement of the skies, when the optimal time is to
          <b>manifest new beginnings</b>, when to perform a ritual for
          <b>money-making</b>, and how to use astrology as a tool for
          <b>self-care</b>.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          With mantras, advice, and
          <b>wellbeing tips for each of the zodiac signs,</b> this guide to
          astrological self-care and living is
          <b>perfect for every star sign.</b><br /><br />
          This book uses standardised GMT for planetary movements (with new and
          full moon information for five different time zones). Readers in other
          time zones may wish to double check if events fall on the previous or
          following date for them.

          Katarina Samohin is an illustrator based in Belgrade, Serbia. She
          began her journey into the world of illustration at the beginning of
          2020, after one lovely trip to Amsterdam. Her art is inspired by
          nature, dreams and small everyday things that bring joy to life. Her
          illustrations reflect her soul – they are a kind of illustrated
          journal. As a quiet person, drawing helps her to express herself and
          open up to the world. Her sketchbook or iPad are always in her bag
          wherever she goes. Katarina likes to collect illustrated books and she
          enjoys sunsets, a beautiful spring day and the cherry blossom season,
          which is her favourite part of the year.<br /><br />Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/katarina_samohin/
