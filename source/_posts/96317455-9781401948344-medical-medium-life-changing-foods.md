            >Experience the next level of medical revelations. Packed with
            information you won’t find anywhere else about the Unforgiving
            Four—the threats responsible for the rise of illness—and the
            miraculous power of food to heal, this book gives you the ability to
            become your own health expert, so you can protect yourself, friends,
            family, and loved ones from symptoms, suffering, and disease.
            Unleash the hidden powers of fruits and vegetables and transform
            your life in the process.<br /></b
          ><br />ANTHONY WILLIAM, the Medical Medium, has helped tens of
          thousands of people heal from ailments that have been misdiagnosed or
          ineffectively treated—or that medical communities can’t resolve. And
          he’s done it all by listening to a divine voice that literally speaks
          into his ear, telling him what is at the root of people’s pain or
          illness and what they need to do to be restored to health.<br /><br />In
          his first book, the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestseller
          <i>Medical Medium</i>, Anthony revealed how you can treat dozens of
          illnesses with targeted healing regimens in which nutrition plays a
          major role. Medical Medium Life-Changing Foods delves deeper into the
          healing power of over 50 fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and
          wild foods that can have an extraordinary effect on health. Anthony
          explains each food’s properties, the symptoms and conditions it can
          help relieve or heal, and the emotional and spiritual benefits it
          brings. And he offers delicious recipes to help you enjoy each food’s
          maximum benefit, from sweet potatoes with braised cabbage stuffing to
          honey-coconut ice cream.<br /><br />YOU’LL DISCOVER:<br /><br />• Why
          wild blueberries are the “resurrection food,” asparagus is the
          fountain of youth, and lemons can lift your spirits when you’ve had
          bad news<br />• The best foods to eat to relieve gallstones,
          hypertension, brain fog, thyroid issues, migraines, and hundreds more
          symptoms and conditions<br />• The particular healing powers of kiwis,
          cucumbers, cat’s claw, coconut, and much more<br />• Insight into
          cravings, how to use stress to your advantage, and the key role fruit
          plays in fertility<br /><br />
          Much of Anthony’s information is dramatically different from the
          conventional wisdom of medical communities, so don’t expect to hear
          the same old food facts rehashed here. Instead, expect to get a whole
          new understanding of why oranges offer more than just vitamin C—and a
          powerful set of tools for healing from illness and keeping yourself
          and your loved ones safe and well.<br />Here are just a few highlights
          of what’s inside:<br /><br />• Critical information about the specific
          factors behind the rise of illness and how to protect yourself and
          your family<br />• Foods to repair your DNA, boost your immune system,
          improve your mental clarity, alkalize every body system, shield you
          from others’ negative emotions, and so much more<br />• Techniques to
          make fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and wild foods the most
          healing they can be for your individual needs<br /><br />
          Plus targeted foods to bring into your life for relief from hundreds
          of symptoms and conditions, including:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;•
          ANXIETY <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;•
          CANCER <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• DIABETES <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• DIGESTIVE
          PROBLEMS <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• FATIGUE <br />&nbsp; • FOOD ALLERGIES
          <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;• INFERTILITY <br />&nbsp; • INFLAMMATION
          <br />&nbsp; • INSOMNIA <br />&nbsp; • LYME DISEASE <br />&nbsp; •
          MEMORY LOSS <br />&nbsp; • MIGRAINES <br />&nbsp; • THYROID DISEASE

          "Within the first three minutes of speaking with me, Anthony precisely
          identified my medical issue! This healer really knows what he’s
          talking about. Anthony’s abilities as the Medical Mediu are unique and
          fascinating."<br />— Alejandro Junger, M.D., New York Times
          best-selling author of Clean, Clean Eats, and Clean Gut, and founder
          of the acclaimed Clean Program<br /><br />"While there is most
          definitely an element of otherworldly mystery to the work he does,
          much of what Anthony William shines a spotlight on—particularly around
          autoimmune disease—feels inherently right and true. What’s better is
          that the protocols he recommends are natural, accessible, and easy to
          do."<br />— Gwyneth Paltrow, Oscar-winning actress, #1 New York Times
          best-selling author of It’s All Easy, founder and CCO of GOOP.com<br /><br />"Anthony
          is a magician for all my label’s recording artists, and if he were a
          record album, he would far surpass Thriller. His ability is nothing
          short of profound, remarkable, extraordinary, and mind-blowing. He is
          a luminary whose books are filled with prophecies. This is the future
          of medicine."<br />— Craig Kallman, Chairman and CEO, Atlantic
          Records<br /><br />"Anthony’s gift has made him a conduit for
          information that is light-years ahead of where science is today."<br />—
          from the foreword by Christiane Northrup, M.D., New York Times
          best-selling author of Goddesses Never Age and Women's Bodies, Women's
          Wisdom<br /><br />"Anthony is not only a warm, compassionate healer,
          he is also authentic and accurate, with God-given skills. He has been
          a total blessing in my life."<br />— Naomi Campbell, model, actress,
          activist<br /><br />"My family and friends have been the recipients of
          Anthony’s inspired gift of healing, and we’ve benefited more than I
          can express with rejuvenated physical and mental health."<br />— Scott
          Bakula, star of Basmati Blues, NCIS: New Orleans, Quantum Leap, and
          Star Trek: Enterprise<br /><br />"How very much we have been moved and
          benefited from the discovery of Anthony and the Compassion Spirit, who
          can reach us with healing wisdom through Anthony's sensitive genius
          and caring mediumship. His book is truly ‘wisdom of the future,’ so
          already now, miraculously, we have the clear, accurate explanation of
          the many mysterious illnesses that the ancient Buddhist medical texts
          predicted would afflict us in this era when over-clever people have
          tampered with the elements of life in the pursuit of profit."<br />—
          Robert Thurman, Jey Tsong Khapa Professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist
          Studies, Columbia University; President, Tibet House US; best-selling
          author of Love Your Enemies and Inner Revolution; host of Bob Thurman
          Podcast<br /><br />"Anthony is a wonderful person. He identified some
          long-term health issues for me, he knew what supplements I needed, and
          I felt better immediately."<br />— Rashida Jones, actress, producer,
          and writer; star of Angie Tribeca and co-star of Parks and Recreation,
          The Social Network, and I Love You, Man<br /><br />"Anthony William
          has devoted his life to helping people with information that has truly
          made a substantial difference in the lives of many."<br />— Amanda de
          Cadenet, host and executive producer of The Conversation<br /><br />"Anthony
          William’s God-given gift for healing is nothing short of
          miraculous."<br />— David James Elliott, Camera Store, Scorpion,
          Trumbo, Mad Men, CSI: NY; star for ten years of CBS’s JAG<br /><br />"Anthony
          William is the gifted Medical Medium who has very real and
          not-so-radical solutions to the mysterious conditions that affect us
          all in our modern world. I am beyond thrilled to know him personally
          and count him as a most valuable resource for my health protocols and
          those for my entire family."<br />— Annabeth Gish, Scandal, The
          Bridge, Brotherhood, The West Wing, Mystic Pizza<br /><br />"I love
          Anthony William! My daughters Sophia and Laura gave me his book for my
          birthday, and I couldn’t put it down. The Medical Medium has helped me
          connect all the dots on my quest to achieve optimal health. Through
          Anthony’s work, I realized the residual Epstein-Barr left over from a
          childhood illness was sabotaging my health years later. Medical Medium
          has transformed my life."<br />— Catherine Bach, The Young and the
          Restless, The Dukes of Hazzard<br /><br />"My recovery from a
          traumatic spinal crisis several years ago had been steady, but I was
          still experiencing muscle weakness, a tapped-out nervous system, as
          well as extra weight. A dear friend called me one evening and strongly
          recommended I read the book Medical Medium by Anthony William. So much
          of the information in the book resonated with me that I began
          incorporating some of the ideas, then I sought and was lucky enough to
          get a consultation. The reading was so spot-on, it has taken my
          healing to an unimagined, deeper, and richer level of health. My
          weight has dropped healthily, I can enjoy bike-riding and yoga, I’m
          back in the gym, I have steady energy, and I sleep deeply. Every
          morning when following my protocols, I smile and say, ‘Whoa, Anthony
          William! I thank you for your restorative gift…Yes!’"<br />— Robert
          Wisdom, Flaked, Chicago P.D., Nashville, The Wire, Ray<br /><br />?"Twelve
          hours after receiving a heaping dose of self-confidence masterfully
          administered by Anthony, the persistent ringing in my ears of the last
          year…began to falter. I am astounded, grateful, and happy for the
          insights offered on moving forward."<br />— Mike Dooley, New York
          Times best-selling author of Infinite Possibilities and scribe of
          Notes from the Universe<br /><br />"He was the answer to my desperate
          prayer.<br />"The moment arrived when I had given up knowing what was
          next. Holding my head heavy in my hands, sobbing uncontrollably at the
          kitchen table, not knowing which way to turn, I realized I had finally
          hit a wall. Through the streaming tears and heaving sobs, I whispered
          what I vowed never to do: ‘I give up.’ I have nothing left in knowing
          what is next, I pleaded to the darkness. I prayed for answers.<br />"Calvin’s
          stomach pain had never ceased after a simple upper respiratory cold
          and stomach upset in January, during his favorite time of year:
          snowboarding season. Since then, it had been five months of consistent
          doctor visits, herbs and supplements, acupuncture and energetic
          healing work, hypnotherapy and homeopathy, psychology, medical tests
          and procedures, paperwork and phone calls, lab tests and
          consultations, medicine and vitamins, more tests, and numerous ER
          visits in snowstorms—all leading to a dead end and no hope in sight,
          with my son’s condition only slowly worsening over time.<br />"I had
          lost faith. I had lost faith in the medical system, in the human
          ability to be able to help, to have any answers. I was exhausted
          physically and emotionally, broken down by the relentlessness of my
          son’s undiagnosable stomach pain and no hope for healing. I had tried
          everything I could possibly imagine and more.<br />"At this point, I
          was told that it was all in his head and to try the ‘psychiatric
          route,’ as they believed there was no physical reason for his
          condition. I had exhausted every possibility over the months of
          exploration with many, many practitioners across the spectrum and even
          revisited some of them to ask, ‘Are you sure we have ruled out
          everything? Are you sure we have not missed something?’<br />"I
          refused to give up.<br />"Although his unexplained stomach pain did
          not fit in any clear diagnosable box, and only continued to worsen, it
          was clear everyone else was done with him, as their bedside manners
          became unsupportive.<br />"Leaving a medical office one day, pushing
          my son in a wheelchair (because it was now too painful and tiring for
          him to walk much) down the long corridor of the medical center from
          which we had spent many, many hours over many months, my ten-year-old
          son looked up at me and said, ‘They aren’t on our side, Mom.’<br />"Through
          the tears I nodded and said, ‘Don’t you worry, Buddy. I am ALWAYS on
          your side. I have not given up, and I will not give up. I am not
          done.’ I tried to hide the uneasiness and the look of ‘Now what?’<br />"Not
          long after, I found myself at that kitchen table in despair, praying
          in the dark. My child was suffering every single day, moaning in pain
          every single day, and I was helpless, not able to do anything to help
          ease his suffering, despite the months of determined and persistent
          efforts. No one understood, no one had the answers, and as much as I
          knew that it was painful for others to witness, which many friends
          told me, it was more painful to live in the grueling experiences of a
          sick child in agonizing pain every day, only to have his condition
          worsen to being bedridden, with clouded mental faculties that
          prevented him from reading and doing math work or any work that
          required mental focus.<br />"Then, the answer to my prayer arrived
          through a text from my mother explaining she had found someone who I
          should check out named Anthony William. I looked him up on his website
          and I felt chills enter my body, chills of hope as I read through his
          website. I sent an email explaining my plight. Anthony William knew
          what was ailing my son within the first three minutes of our phone
          conversation, explaining that Calvin had a mutated shingles virus
          inflaming his vagus nerve. This explained the nerve pain and the lack
          of physical evidence in any blood work or other existing diagnostic
          tools. It also explained the reason behind the mental/brain struggle
          in Calvin’s reading and schoolwork.<br />"Anthony reassured me that
          this was a physical cause for his ‘mystery illness’ and was NOT
          psychological. Tears ran down my face—my gut instinct finally being
          acknowledged as true. He was the ONLY person who had ever been able to
          pinpoint so confidently, quickly, and accurately a direction for
          healing.<br />"Anthony proceeded to flood me with information that
          would aid in my son’s healing, which I vigorously wrote down. He was
          deeply caring and reassuring. He was available to me when I needed him
          for follow-up calls (even in the middle of the night), emotional
          support, and as my cheerleader to keep me going as Calvin recovered.
          Anthony understood the intense stress placed on our whole family as we
          endured the intensity of his painful illness for so long without any
          progress. He never failed in his delivery to be supportive and
          compassionate.<br />"Over the course of the next two months, staying
          true to the protocol, my son healed. He was back to being himself, an
          active, engaged, happy, pain-free ten-year-old boy. Five years later,
          my son continues to thrive without any setbacks in his health. I am
          forever grateful for Anthony for saving my son’s life, for restoring
          my faith in the human ability to be of help, and for supporting faith
          in my own inner wisdom when it comes to my gut instinct as a
          mother.<br />"It is clear how deeply committed Anthony is to his work
          in serving others in order that they may have the possibility to lead
          healthy, vibrant lives. He truly is a gift to the world."<br />—
          Kristin Cassidy<br /><br />"Anthony is a seer and a wellness sage. His
          gift is remarkable. With his guidance I’ve been able to pinpoint and
          address a health issue that’s been plaguing me for years."<br />— Kris
          Carr, New York Times best-selling author of Crazy Sexy Juice, Crazy
          Sexy Kitchen, and Crazy Sexy Diet<br /><br />"Anthony William is the
          Edgar Cayce of our time, reading the body with outstanding precision
          and insight. Anthony identifies the underlying causes of diseases that
          often baffle the most astute conventional and alternative health-care
          practitioners. Anthony’s practical and profound advice makes him one
          of the most powerfully effective healers of the 21st century."<br />—
          Ann Louise Gittleman, New York Times best-selling author of 30 books
          on health and healing and creator of the highly popular Fat Flush
          detox and diet plan<br /><br />"I rely on Anthony William for my and
          my family’s health. Even when doctors are stumped, Anthony always
          knows what the problem is and the pathway for healing."<br />— Chelsea
          Field, The Last Boy Scout, Andre<br /><br />"As a Hollywood
          businesswoman, I know value. Some of Anthony’s clients spent over $1
          million seeking help for their ‘mystery illness’ until they finally
          discovered him."<br />— Nanci Chambers, co-star of JAG; Hollywood
          producer and entrepreneur<br /><br />"Anthony William’s invaluable
          advice on preventing and combating disease is years ahead of what’s
          available anywhere else."<br />— Richard Sollazzo, M.D., New York
          board-certified oncologist, hematologist, nutritionist, and anti-aging
          expert and author of Balance Your Health<br /><br />"Whenever Anthony
          William recommends a natural way of improving your health, it works.
          I’ve seen this with my daughter, and the improvement was impressive.
          His approach of using natural ingredients is a more effective way of
          healing."<br />— Martin D. Shafiroff, Managing Director of Barclays

          Wealth Advisor by Barron’s<br /><br />"Any quantum physicist will tell
          you there are things at play in the universe we can’t yet understand.
          I truly believe Anthony has a handle on them. He has an amazing gift
          for intuitively tapping into the most effective methods for
          healing."<br />— Caroline Leavitt, New York Times best-selling author
          of Cruel Beautiful World, Is This Tomorrow, and Pictures of You<br /><br />"I
          had a health reading from Anthony, and he accurately told me things
          about my body only known to me. This kind, sweet, hilarious,
          self-effacing, and generous man—also so ‘otherworldly’ and so
          extraordinarily gifted, with an ability that defies how we see the
          world—has shocked even me, a medium! He is truly our modern-day Edgar
          Cayce, and we are immensely blessed that he is with us. Anthony
          William proves that we are more than we know."<br />— Colette
          Baron-Reid, best-selling author of Uncharted, TV host of Messages from
          Spirit<br /><br />"In 2015, my previously healthy five-year-old
          daughter started to develop neurological issues such as wobbly legs,
          frequent falls, an inability to walk when going from sitting to
          standing, general weakness, and decreased strength. She was at the
          point of thirty leg episodes a day, and it was worsening week by week.
          We went to different specialists at one of the best children’s
          hospitals—no answers, other than a neurologist’s&nbsp; label of
          paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia. Being a nurse for ten years and my
          medical community not providing me answers about why my daughter was
          getting worse was a hard pill to swallow. It hit home too hard.<br />"At
          first, I was too scared to contact Anthony William about my daughter,
          because we hadn’t yet ruled out a brain/spine tumor, and I was so
          scared to hear the truth. But after some time, I got an appointment
          with Anthony, and he explained everything—that my daughter had a
          specific virus that he knew about in her brain. In that moment, I felt
          like I became a different person. Hearing the truth from Anthony
          William and having a protocol to follow literally changed me forever!
          I got hope! With my daughter on the protocol, my family and I started
          to see improvements in her. She stopped falling, was getting stronger,
          and her leg episodes were fewer and fewer! Now, a year later, she is
          the strongest she has ever been and can physically function like any
          six-year-old. I believe angels from above led me to Anthony William
          just when I needed him the most. Forever grateful!"<br />— Justyna
          Siek<br /><br />"Anthony William changed by son’s life for the better
          in 2007. My son was lethargic, pale, and struggled with a chronic
          asthmatic cough. He had a lack of appetite and did not have energy to
          participate in much activity. After visiting multiple doctors in
          several different states without any answers except ‘asthma’ and
          medications to treat the asthmatic symptoms, I was fortunate enough to
          have a session with Anthony William where he gave me specific
          information about the source of my son’s problems as well as holistic
          ways in which to repair them. Nine years later, my son is a high-level
          athlete who is thriving in all areas of his life. It is hard to
          express the gratitude I feel toward Anthony William for his invaluable
          insight that directly led to my son’s amazing recovery into the
          teenager I always hoped he could be—active, healthy, happy, and
          enjoying life with a smile on his face and boundless energy!"<br />—
