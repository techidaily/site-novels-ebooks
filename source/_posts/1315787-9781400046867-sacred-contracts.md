          Caroline Myss, author of the<i> New York Times</i> bestsellers
          <b>Anatomy of the Spirit </b>and
          <b>Why People Don’t Heal and How They Can</b>, presents an exciting,
          highly original program in this long-awaited book. Based on her
          internationally popular workshop of the same name,
          <b>Sacred Contracts</b> is a brilliant synthesis of psychology,
          healing guidance, and spiritual insight.<br /><br />As a medical
          intuitive, Myss has found that people often don’t understand their
          purpose in life, which has led to a spiritual malaise of epidemic
          proportions. This metaphysical disease in turn leads to depression,
          anxiety, fatigue, and eventually physical illness.<br /><br />But our
          purpose—our individual <b>Sacred Contract</b>—is often difficult to
          apprehend. For this reason, Myss developed an enjoyable and ingenious
          process for deciphering your own Contract using a new theory of
          archetypes that builds on the works of Jung, Plato, and contemporary
          thinkers. She first recounts how the concept of
          <b>Sacred Contracts</b> took form in myths and other cultural
          traditions through the ages. She then examines the lives of the
          spiritual masters and prophets—Abraham, Jesus, the Buddha, and
          Muhammad—whose archetypal journeys illustrate the four stages of a
          Sacred Contract and provide clues for discovering your own.<br /><br />With
          her signature motivational style and stories, Myss explains how you
          can identify your particular spiritual energies, or archetypes—the
          gatekeepers of your higher purpose—and use them to help you find out
          what you are here on earth to learn and whom you are meant to meet. In
          coming to know your archetypal companions, you also begin to see how
          to live your life in ways that make the best use of your personal
          power and lead you to fulfill your greatest—in fact, your
          divine—potential. <br /><br />In this process, you learn how to see
          your life—and the lives of others—symbolically, allowing you to manage
          your personal power without getting caught up in emotional drama. You
          will also learn how to fulfill your Sacred Contract: what you and only
          you are here on earth to do. Finally, Myss offers specific guidance
          for locating your physical and emotional vulnerabilities and healing
          any susceptible areas.<br /><br />Both visionary and practical, Sacred
          Contracts is a completely unique process of self-discovery and
          spiritual archaeology and a bold, powerful work of spiritual wisdom.
