          <b>An in-depth study into the mystery and purpose of angels</b
          ><br /><br />• Explains that angels are beings of light consciousness,
          here to help our individual and planetary cosmic evolution<br /><br />•
          Explores angels from Judeo-Christian and Islamic faiths, Hinduism and
          Buddhism, the beliefs of ancient Egypt, Yezidism, and Zoroastrianism
          as well as what Theosophists, Kabbalists, Sufi masters, Eastern gurus,
          and modern mystics like Edgar Cayce have recounted about angels<br /><br />•
          Examines contemporary angelic encounters, including the author’s own
          interactions with angels, and also looks at the purpose of dark angels
          and fallen angels<br /><br />From the divine messengers of Western
          traditions to the devas of Eastern traditions to the meleks and spirit
          beings found along the Silk Road, angels are one of the unifying
          themes of theology worldwide. But what is an angel, and why do they
          contact us, believers and nonbelievers alike?<br /><br />In this
          in-depth study into the mystery and purpose of angels, Normandi Ellis
          looks at the angelic dimensions of spiritual traditions around the
          world—from the ancient past to present day. She explores well-known
          angels from Judeo-Christian and Islamic faiths, the Hindu devata and
          Buddhist spirit beings, the spirit beings of ancient Egypt, the
          Peacock Angel of Yezidism, and the yazatas of Zoroastrianism. She
          compares angelic visions from medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas
          and John of Damascus with what Theosophists, kabbalists, Sufi masters,
          Eastern gurus, and modern mystics like Edgar Cayce have recounted
          about angels. She looks at dark and fallen angels and their role in
          the grand cosmological plan. Quoting from sacred traditions, narrative
          myth, and contemporary angelic encounters, including her own personal
          interactions with angels, the author clarifies the divergent aspects
          of angelic beliefs but also reveals the common points shared by all
          traditions. <br /><br />Ellis shows how, in whatever guise they
          appear, angels are messengers. She explains that angels are beings of
          light consciousness, part of the universal life force that connects
          all beings. And not only are angels actively helping in our planet’s
          cosmic evolution, they also help us see our own place in the cosmic
          plan.

        <p>
          “Normandi Ellis’s book <i>The Ancient Tradition of Angels</i> is a
          rare pearl and a welcome and inspired addition to human consciousness
          of who angels are, what their purpose is, and above all the unifying
          nature of angels, present in the contexts of all faiths and cultures
          (whether they are known by that name or another). Ellis’s clarity
          allows for an ecumenical view of this divine assistance, ready to help
          all who are open to receive. The book begins with beautiful portraits
          from cultures around the planet, including depictions of the sacred,
          the divine, and the angelic. Highly recommended for angel newcomers as
          well as those who walk with angels already!”
