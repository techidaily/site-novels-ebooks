          ‘Laurey is just so inspiring and I love her way of looking at the
          world’ Deliciously Ella
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Working with Laurey has been so fantastic. She brings an incredible
          sense of peace, calm and serenity with her, which is so inspiring.
          I’ve loved learning about meditation and the traditional ceremonies
          that surround those ancient practises from her, and it’s really pushed
          me to begin my own meditation journey.’ Deliciously Ella
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Laurey is not only a wonderful make up artist but she also introduced
          me to the world of crystals and meditation. Laurey would always make
          whatever space we were working in – big, small or ugly – become a
          relaxing, calming and beautiful space before she would do my make-up.
          From the palo santo wood, the essential oils to the crystal she would
          put in my hand to help with whatever situation I faced that day, it
          was so thoughtful and intriguing. She always knew how to help. My
          whole band were so interested by her methods that they all started to
          have crystals with them on stage and on the tour bus! Her passion is
          infectious and is a beautiful thing to be enjoyed.’ Jessie Ware
