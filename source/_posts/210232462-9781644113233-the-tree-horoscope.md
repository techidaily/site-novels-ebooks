          • Explains how to determine your personal tree of life depending on
          your date of birth and how this tree reveals your gifts, talents, and
          life path <br /><br />• Features full-color photos that capture the
          true spirit of the trees <br /><br />• Details each tree’s spiritual
          meaning, element family, essential qualities, healing effects, gifts
          and talents, and symbolism <br /><br />Drawing on her intimate
          knowledge of trees and connections to Celtic traditions, Daniela
          Christine Huber shares a new interpretation of the tree horoscope
          calendar--where 22 archetypal trees are associated with different
          dates throughout the year and just like birth stones or astrological
          signs can reveal your innate talents and unique life path.
          <br /><br />Featuring full-color photos that capture the true spirit
          of the trees as well as in-depth descriptions of the characteristic
          qualities of the tree personality types, Huber’s guide explains how to
          determine your personal tree of life depending on your date of birth
          and reveals how this tree stands by your side with its gifts and
          talents as a faithful friend and companion for a lifetime. The 22
          trees of the calendar are Oak, Hazelnut, Rowan, Maple, Walnut, Yew,
          Chestnut, Ash, Hornbeam, Fig, Birch, Apple, Fir, Elm, Olive, Cypress,
          Poplar, Cedar, Pine, Willow, Linden, and Beech. Each tree species
          occurs twice in the annual cycle, except for Oak, Birch, Olive, and
          Beech, which are specially assigned to the equinoxes and solstices.
          Each tree description explores the tree’s spiritual meaning, element
          family, essential qualities, healing effects, gifts and talents, and
          symbolism. The author also includes an everlasting birthday calendar
          to record the birthdates of your family and friends, and she looks at
          the birth trees of several famous people. <br /><br />Showing how each
          of the 22 trees of the tree horoscope holds great power, Huber
          explains how your birth tree is the guardian of your individual
          potential and reveals the abilities and talents available to you in
          your life. Recognizing and developing the gifts that your birth tree
          reveals can help you dissolve entrenched habits and patterns, regain
          inner balance, and activate the full potential of your tree horoscope
          destiny.

          "All in all, this is a wonderful book for those hoping to learn more
          about their personality and discover how it is shaped by their
          birth-tree. I think <i>The Tree Horoscope</i> would make a great
          birthday gift, though it’s also useful to store birth dates of loved
          ones to make sure you never miss their special day. The beautiful
          photographs are a wonderful way to practice tree identification. While
          this is only a small snippet of the mythology of Celtic trees, the
          book is a good starting point for those who want to learn more about
          the different symbolisms and energies of these mighty connectors of
          heaven and earth. I’ve really loved reading this book and will
          definitely be referring back to it as the days of the year go by to
          see which tree energy is present."
