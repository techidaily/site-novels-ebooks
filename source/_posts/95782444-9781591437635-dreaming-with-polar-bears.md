          A guide to co-dreaming with animals for personal and planetary
          evolution <br />
          <br />• Presents lucid dream encounters with living polar bears and
          teachings from polar bear spirits <br />
          <br />• Explores ways to consciously engage with dreams, co-dream with
          animals through shared awareness, and form human-animal dream
          relationships <br />
          <br />• Reveals the role of human-polar bear dreaming in the Earth’s
          planetary evolution <br />
          <br />Dreams speak to us on deep levels. Through dreaming we open a
          gateway to our inner world. Through lucid dreaming we open to
          conscious interaction with the surroundings, happenings, and living
          beings within the dreamscape. <br />
          <br />Over many years, animal communicator Dawn Baumann Brunke dreamed
          of polar bears. One night, a lucid dream triggered the realization
          that not only was she dreaming of a living polar bear but also that
          the polar bear was dreaming of her. Through shared dream encounters,
          Brunke became adept at connecting with the bear both while asleep and
          awake. Together, they explored nonphysical locales where lucid
          dreamers meet to join in consciousness and co-dream together. <br />
          <br />Recounting the dreams she had with polar bears as well as with a
          council of spirit bears, Brunke presents techniques she learned to
          enter shared dreamscapes and form meaningful dream relationships with
          other species. Brunke also examines how our assumptions about polar
          bears, or any animal, can teach us about ourselves. As we awaken to
          the wisdom of our dreams, we begin to heal ourselves and our Earth.
          <br />
          <br />Sharing ways to recall dreams and engage lucid dream awareness,
          Brunke shows how dreamwork can help us forge deeper connections with
          the natural world and move more consciously in planetary evolution
          with all beings. Guided by the polar bears in her dreams, the sacred
          guardians of North Pole evolutionary energy, Brunke reveals how we can
          each dream ourselves awake and, with animal companions and guides,
          help dream a new world into being.

          “In this remarkable book, Dawn Brunke reminds us that we exist within
          an interconnected oneness of depth, beauty, and awareness--if only we
          wake up, look around, and listen. Lucid dreaming helps us experience
          deeper connections in a life-altering way and recognize the living
          awareness of other species, our shared planet, and the vast universe.
          <i>Dreaming with Polar Bears </i>encourages us all to wake up,
          remember, and understand this ancient knowledge.”
