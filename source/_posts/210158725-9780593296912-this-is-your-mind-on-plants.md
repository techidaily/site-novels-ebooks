            >The instant <i>New York Times </i>bestseller | A
            <i>Washington Post </i>Notable Book | One of NPR's Best Books of the
            Year<br /><br />“Expert storytelling . . . [Pollan] masterfully
            elevates a series of big questions about drugs, plants and humans
            that are likely to leave readers thinking in new ways.” —<b
              ><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b
            >
            <br /><br />From #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Michael
            Pollan, a radical challenge to how we think about drugs, and an
            exploration into the powerful human attraction to psychoactive
            plants—and the equally powerful taboos.</b
          ><br /><br />Of all the things humans rely on plants for—sustenance,
          beauty, medicine, fragrance, flavor, fiber—surely the most curious is
          our use of them to change consciousness: to stimulate or calm, fiddle
          with or completely alter, the qualities of our mental experience. Take
          coffee and tea: People around the world rely on caffeine to sharpen
          their minds. But we do not usually think of caffeine as a drug, or our
          daily use as an addiction, because it is legal and socially
          acceptable. So, then, what is a “drug”? And why, for example, is
          making tea from the leaves of a tea plant acceptable, but making tea
          from a seed head of an opium poppy a federal crime?<br /><br />
          In <i>This Is Your Mind on Plants</i>, Michael Pollan dives deep into
          three plant drugs—opium, caffeine, and mescaline—and throws the
          fundamental strangeness, and arbitrariness, of our thinking about them
          into sharp relief. Exploring and participating in the cultures that
          have grown up around these drugs while consuming (or, in the case of
          caffeine, trying <i>not</i> to consume) them, Pollan reckons with the
          powerful human attraction to psychoactive plants. Why do we go to such
          great lengths to seek these shifts in consciousness, and then why do
          we fence that universal desire with laws and customs and fraught
          feelings?<br /><br />
          In this unique blend of history, science, and memoir, as well as
          participatory journalism, Pollan examines and experiences these plants
          from several very different angles and contexts, and shines a fresh
          light on a subject that is all too often treated reductively—as a
          drug, whether licit or illicit. But that is one of the least
          interesting things you can say about these plants, Pollan shows, for
          when we take them into our bodies and let them change our minds, we
          are engaging with nature in one of the most profound ways we can.
          Based in part on an essay published almost twenty-five years ago, this
          groundbreaking and singular consideration of psychoactive plants, and
          our attraction to them through time, holds up a mirror to our
          fundamental human needs and aspirations, the operations of our minds,
          and our entanglement with the natural world.

          “Delightful . . . [<i>This Is Your Mind On Plants</i>] aims to
          collapse the distinctions between legal and illegal, medical and
          recreational, exotic and everyday, by appealing to the principle that
          unites the three: the affinities between plant biochemistry and the
          human mind.” —<b><i>New York Review of Books</i></b
          ><br /><br />“[A] thoughtful study . . . As the U.S.’s drug policies
          become less punitive, [Pollan] argues, we should think more clearly
          about substances we’ve come to depend on.” —<b
            ><i>The New Yorker</i></b
          >
          <br /><br />“[A] wonderful and compelling read that will leave you
          thinking long after you set it down . . . Pollan is an astonishingly
          good writer, at times intimate and vulnerable, at times curious and
          expository, always compelling and credible. Reading his writing can be
          kind of like taking a psychedelic—a literary onomatopoeia.”
          <b><i>—Washington Post </i></b><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          “Pollan is a mindful and enthusiastic psychonaut. He is also a gifted
          writer, who synthesizes unruly social histories and wreathes them
          around his own drug-taking experiences. And he articulates these
          experiences with great insight and eloquence.”
          <b><i>—The New Republic&nbsp; </i></b><br /><br />“Expert storytelling
          . . . [Pollan] masterfully elevates a series of big questions about
          drugs, plants and humans that are likely to leave readers thinking in
          new ways.” <b>—<i>New York Times Book Review</i></b>
          <br /><br />“Fascinating . . . <i>This Is Your Mind On Plants</i> has
          much to offer its readers, whether they are curious about the
          plant-based adventures of others or the science of substances at work
          in their own minds. With historical depth, political punch, and
          narrative exuberance, Pollan's book sounds a call to reimagine
          society's relationship with psychoactive plants.”
          <b>—<i>Boston Globe</i></b
          ><br /><br />"Pollan’s insatiable appetite to learn every possible
          morsel about the subject on which he is writing is a gift that has
          proved itself with best-seller after best-seller . . . .&nbsp;Anchored
          by a refreshing willingness to expose his own blind spots, [<i
            >This Is Your Mind On Plants</i
          >] is an engrossing, plant-powered blend of general history,
          contemporary reporting and potent self-reflection."—<b
            ><i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> </b
          ><br /><br />“The author of <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> turns his
          attention to three consciousness-altering drugs—opium, mescaline and
          caffeine (yes, it’s a drug)—in this eye-opening exploration.”
          <b><i>—People </i></b><br /><br />“[H]ighly engaging reading . . .
          Pollan’s writing always has a personal aspect to it, but in his latest
          work he takes an even more central role in the narrative, and his book
          is the better for it.” <b><i>—The Daily Beast</i></b>
          <br /><br />“Pollan weaves together three separately engaging stories
          in a pleasantly meandering style, deftly using his personal
          experiences with each compound as a jumping-off point for small forays
          into anthropology, history, politics, psychology, molecular biology,
          and neuroscience. Even the most distracted reader will come away with
          an understanding of the physical effects of the spotlighted substances
          as well as their cultural significance.” <b>—<i>Science</i></b
          ><br /><br />“The omnivorously curious Pollan pivots off his
          provocative <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> with an enthralling odyssey
          into a trio of mind-altering drugs found in plants: opium, caffeine,
          and mescaline. In this wide-ranging, deliciously written study, he
          asks, why does one power us up each morning while the other two are
          shrouded in taboo? You’ll never look at a Starbucks Pike’s Peak the
          same way again.” <b>—<i>Oprah Daily</i></b
          ><br /><br />“<i>This Is Your Mind on Plants</i> is an entertaining
          blend of memoir, history and social commentary that illustrates
          Pollan’s ability to be both scientific and personal. By relying on
          contextual history and focusing on three popular, if misunderstood,
          drugs, Pollan challenges common views on what mind-altering drugs are
          and what they can accomplish.”&nbsp;&nbsp;—<b
            ><i>BookPage</i> (starred​ review)</b
          ><br /><br />“Pollan is a master of breaking down complex science into
          an engaging story and challenging long-held societal beliefs. His
          newest offering, which follows his examination of the science of
          psychedelics in 2018’s <i>How to Change Your Mind</i>, aims to unpack
          our ideas about what constitutes a ‘drug’ and, fundamentally, why we
          seek them.” <b><i>—TIME</i></b
          ><br /><br />“Building on his lysergically drenched book
          <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> (2018), Pollan looks at three
          plant-based drugs and the mental effects they can produce. . . . A
          lucid (in the sky with diamonds) look at the hows, whys, and
          occasional demerits of altering one’s mind.”
