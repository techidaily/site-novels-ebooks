          Sparky's story shines the spotlight on crimes against American
          children that were sanctioned on a national scale by the United States
          government. At the age of six in 1955, she was sold by her parents to
          the Sex Magick cult run by the CIA under its illegal program of secret
          experimentation on mind control called Monarch. By the time she was
          ten, she'd been purposely split into multiple identities, each one
          associated with a different age and place as her family moved around
          the country to avoid Child Protective Services and the police. With
          each new identity, she forgot the last one. In Imperial Beach,
          California, inside&nbsp;a tough neighborhood of gangs and brothels
          abutting the Tijuana Sewer and the Mexican border, she discovered her
          own courage in the determined persona of a new character, Sparky
          MacGregor. As she grew older, Sparky's memory faded as she was moved
          from one location to the next. At the age of seventeen, she escaped
          from a camp in Big Sur, and left childhood behind. She became a
          physician, raised a family and moved to Moscow where she founded and
          ran an underground railroad for child sex trafficking victims from the
          former USSR. Years later, she returned to Imperial Beach to speak at
          an international conference on border security. The memory of her lost
          childhood suddenly returned.

          "SPARKY is an extraordinary work, more thriller than memoir. The
          author weaves a terrifying yet compelling tale and maintains tension
          on every page. A tragic and yet a triumphant read. A page-turner all
          the way through." â€”Richard W. Marek,&nbsp;Editor, Richard Marek Books
          at Putnam Publishing Group, author of Works of Genius and editor of
          The Bourne Identity by Robert Ludlum.

        <p>
          Juliette M Engel was born into a family of intelligence operatives and
          initiated into the CIA's newly established Monarch program in 1955 at
          the age of six. Long after leaving Sex Magick, she ran the Angel
          Coalition in Moscow, an underground railroad that rescued and
          repatriated child sex-trafficking survivors, for ten years.
