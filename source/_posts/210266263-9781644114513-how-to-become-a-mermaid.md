          Details how to connect to water as a living presence and develop
          personal and spiritual connections with fish and other aquatic animals
          <br /><br />• Explains how to embody the vibration of water in your
          energy field by integrating archetypes of water spirits and watery
          concepts such as empathy, unconditional love, eco-consciousness, and
          stillness <br /><br />• Shares the author’s personal experiences,
          beginning at age 10, with astral mermaids, water spirits, and other
          magical creatures <br /><br />Anyone can become a mermaid. To do so,
          you must develop the vibration of water in your energy field and learn
          to perceive as mermaids do. In this how-to guide, Elyrria Swann shares
          her personal experiences, beginning at age 10, with astral mermaids,
          water spirits, and other magical creatures and offers wisdom and
          practical lessons from the watery kingdom to reveal the path to
          becoming a mermaid. <br /><br />Swann details how to connect to water
          as a living presence and awaken to its magic, as she did as a child.
          Exploring how to develop mermaid energies, she shows how to make
          friends with fish and develop personal and spiritual connections with
          them and other aquatic animals, including how to communicate through
          dreams, meditations, and visions. She explains how to embody the
          vibration of water in your energy field by integrating archetypes of
          water spirits and watery concepts such as empathy, unconditional love,
          eco-consciousness, and stillness. She explores how to develop
          relationships with astral allies like krakens, gorgon medusas, and
          selkies as well as protection techniques to use when making contact
          with spiritual beings. Channeling the merfolk she has built personal
          relationships with, Swann sheds light on the inner workings of the
          mermaid realm, offering insight into their innermost thoughts, states
          of being, and how they live. <br /><br />Presenting a user’s manual
          for incarnated merpeople, the author shares the message of the
          mermaids to help unite the mermaid and human worlds and protect our
          oceans as well as to help us develop emotionally, evolve spiritually,
          and ascend to higher vibrational dimensions.
