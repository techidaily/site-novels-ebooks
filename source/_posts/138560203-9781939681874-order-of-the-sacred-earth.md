          Matthew Fox, a 76-year-old elder, activist and spiritual theologian,
          along with Skylar Wilson, a 33-year-old wilderness guide, leader of
          inter-cultural ceremonies, and an event producer, and Jennifer Berit
          Listug, a 28-year-old writer, spiritual leader, and publicist, are
          presenting a challenge and an opportunity in the vision launched in
          this modest book. That vision is about creating an Order of the Sacred
          Earth. Essay contributors to the book and its vision include Mirabai
          Starr, Brian Thomas Swimme, Adam Bucko, and David Korten.

          “<i>The Order of the Sacred Earth</i> is a vision as vital and
          inspired as any on our planet in this time of cultural collapse and
          regeneration—a gathering together of mystic warriors and visionary
          artisans of cultural evolution. There are now millions of us—imaginal
          cells of emerging ecocentric cultures—but what is needed is a
          consciously convened community that brings us together to
          synergistically deepen and amplify our artistry and to train and
          initiate others. Fox and Wilson’s co-dreamed vision draws from the
          very heart of the dream of the Earth.”—Bill Plotkin, author of
          <i>Soulcraft</i> and
          <i>Wild Mind: A Field Guide to the Human Psyche</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “<i>The Order of the Sacred Earth</i> not only calls us home to our
          true nature as Earth, but also offers us invaluable guidance and
          company on the way.”—Joanna Macy, environmental activist and author of
          eight books, including <i>Active Hope</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “The creation of he Order of the Sacred Earth is a magnificent step
          forward for humanity. What we need now are sacred activists willing to
          come together to live conscious and sacred lives while pooling their
          resources and passions to preserve the earth and humanity. I am
          honored to celebrate and join this great adventure!”—Andrew Harvey,
          author of over thirty books, including <i>Way of Passion</i> and
          <i>The Hope</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “I feel grateful for this inspiring book and the inspiring initiative
          it launches. <i>The Order of the Sacred Earth</i> gives me new hope;
          its founders are visionaries who set out a plausible program to engage
          all aspects of our life, and motivate much-needed change. I hope and
          pray that their message and their Order will spread and transform our
          relationships with the Earth and with each other.”—Rupert Sheldrake,
          PhD, author of <i>Science Set Free</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “In this timely book, the authors provide a blueprint for creating a
          sacred community, one united by compassion, social action, and a
          commitment to protecting the sacred earth. The historic framework of
          spiritual renaissance outlined in the book provides a helpful
          perspective for relating to this call to a new order. May everyone who
          reads this book be inspired to take the vows of The Order of the
          Sacred Earth so they may find the clarity in commitment, direction,
          purpose and vision the authors so generously offer!”—Isa Gucciardi,
          PhD, author of <i>Coming to Peace</i> and founding director of the
          Foundation of the Sacred Stream
        </p>
        <p>
          “It is with great joy that I discover this vision of an Order of the
          Sacred Earth….Everywhere I go now, as I travel and teach, I am seeing
          these seeds bursting through the ravaged landscape. The youth I meet
          are hungry for meaningful spiritual practice and are wary of organized
          religion…..I want to be part of this revolutionary effort to build a
          holy container in which to access and express the deepest truths of
          love echoing from the heart of the world’s wisdom communities in honor
          of ‘Our sister, mother earth,’ who sustains us.”—Mirabai Star,
          spiritual teacher and author of
          <i
            >God of Love: A Guide to the Heart of Judaism, Christianity &amp;
            Islam</i
          >; <i>Caravan of No Despair: A Memoir of Loss and Transformation</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “'I promise to be the best lover and defender of Mother Earth that I
          can be.' Might this sacred pledge required of those who join the Order
          of the Sacred earth save humanity and our Earth Mother? It is surely
          worth a try....I welcome the opportunity to find a spiritual home and
          intellectual identity in an Order of the Sacred Earth in fellowship
          with other spiritual-intellectual— activist seekers/doers seeking a
          deeper truth beyond the partial and outdated cosmologies of
          established religious dogma and political ideology.”—David Korten,
          author of
          <i
            >Change the Story, Change the Future: A Living Economy for a Living
            Earth</i

          <i>The Great Turning: From Empire to Earth Community</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “What we are facing demands a strategy and commitment of this
          magnitude and this courage! We cannot stand isolated and expect to
          make any real difference. I thank Matthew Fox, Skylar Wilson, and
          Jennifer Berit Listug for gathering us together.”—Fr. Richard Rohr,
          Center for Action and Contemplation, Albuquerque, New Mexico
        </p>
        <p>
          “<i>The Order of the Sacred Earth</i> has the potential to be a
          shapeshifter of our culture, transforming humankind on the individual
          and community levels to nurture our relationships with all of life.
          This powerful vision will touch the hearts of sacred activists while
          helping to heal our Earth.”—Michael Murphy, co-founder of Esalen
          Institute and author of <i>The Future of the Body</i> and
          <i>Golf in the Kingdom</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Creative and sensitive humans alive today yearn to make a difference
          in the world. They can feel the creativity that surges within
          them….What they need is a way of activating these creative powers.
          That is what the Order of the Sacred Earth is.”—Brian Thomas Swimme,
          cosmologist and author of <i>The Universe Story</i> and
          <i>Journey of the Universe</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “Every human being benefits from intimacy with a place where the
          original wild temple is still present as a felt-sense, not just a
          gorgeous view. We have psycho-spiritual receptors for an experiential,
          embodied, mystical sense of the sacred Earth….Yet we are a long way
          from such a world. But now, with the emerging Order of the Sacred
          Earth,…we are closer to an articulated vision of what such a world
          might be. We are generating new communities who react and participate
          in a profoundly meaningful, mystical relationship with our shared
          larger body, Earth.”—Geneen Marie Haugen, loves to intertwine
          mysteries of nature and psyche and has contributed to many
          spirituality journals
        </p>
        <p>
          “We need a new interspiritual order. One that exists outside of the
          current (or failing) institutions and that encourage us to, in the
          words of philosopher Ken Wilber, ‘show up, wake up and grow up.’…It is
          my hope that this new order serves as a mark of identity—a form of
          tribal war paint—so that we can see each other more clearly,….Only
          then can we become more human and less alone….Only then can we, as a
          species, live to tell a new story and find each other inside
          it.”—Joran Slane Oppelt, international speaker, author, interfaith
          minister and singer/songwriter and founder of the Metta Center of St.
          Petersburg and Integral Church there
        </p>
        <p>
          “The Order of the Sacred Earth enables us to integrate our varied
          actions worldwide, energizing our quantum connectedness for greater
          personal and planetary well- being. Accepting our roles as
          visionaries, co-creators, and Earth lovers, we can be daring
          collaborators with each other and nature.”—J. Zohara Meyerhoff
          Hieronimus, DHL, award-winning radio broadcaster
          (www.21stcenturyradio.com), author, social justice, environmental and
          animal activist
        </p>
        <p>
          “The Order of the Sacred Earth can provide not merely new ideas and
          practices, but also a community in which to grow and to nourish them.
          Just as plants require soil in which to flourish, ideas and practices
          require strong communities….Our work succeeds when we can create
          caring communities in which young people are free and trust one
          another….So the work of the OSE is deeply revolutionary, for it
          challenges our most fundamental assumptions in capitalist culture. To
          re-image a core narrative…can, and will, be done, through the
          commitment to creating, through the order, a new kind of caring
          community.”—Theodore Richards, educator and founder of the Chicago
          Wisdom Project, author of
          <i>The Great Re-imagining: Spirituality in an Age of Apocalypse</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “The Order of the Sacred Earth will be like that—full of joy, because
          it is an invitation to participate in the evolutionary intentions of
          the Universe. What could be more purposeful and fun than that?! The
          revolution that Matthew, Skylar and Jennifer are ushering in and
          leading is perhaps the most important ever, because we really are on
          the precipice and everything, everything is at stake. So let’s take
          the vow: I promise to be the best lover and defender of the Earth that
          I can be; roll up our sleeves and get to it! Don’t forget to bring
          your banjo and dancing shoes!”—Kristal Parks, activist whose special
          commitment for ten years was to defend elephants in Kenya, author of
          <i>Re-Enchanting the World: A Call to Mystical Activism</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          “We can begin to feel our own ‘impeccable warrior’ rise up to
          participate in what Joanna Macy has so aptly called ‘The Great
          Turning.’ For Macy, to participate in the restoration of the earth
          community’s body and spirit is to find ourselves engaging in any or
          all of the following dimensions: Holding Actions, propagating Shifts
          in consciousness, and generating structural Changes. I contend that
          every individual can participate in this Great Turning, and that one
          of the great challenges of our time is for each of us to figure out
          how and where we plug into this psycho-spiritual current. Perhaps the
          OSE can be a guiding community, helping us put our revolutionary
          passion into action.”—Trevien Stanger, tree planter who has planted
          100,000 new trees and who teaches environmental studies at a community
          college in Vermont
        </p>
        <p>
          “It is this broken world that is ‘waiting,’ as Henri Nouwen wrote,
          ‘...for new saints, ecstatic men and women who are so deeply rooted in
          the love of God’ that they are free to imagine a radical new political
          and social reality that reflects compassion and justice. It is this
          broken world from which Matthew Fox’s dream of the Order of the Sacred
          Earth has emerged. And it is this broken world that has called forth
          the Holy Resistance we witnessed at Standing Rock.”—Adam Bucko and
          Rev. Chelsea Macmillian
        </p>
        <p>
          “As an African American male, witnessing the suffering of poor health
          quality within my community, I felt I had to do something about
          it….Over time, I soon came to understand that the well-being in the
          black community is inseparable from that of everyone else and the
          planet as a whole. The Order of the Sacred Earth calls on us to take
          full responsibility for our connection to this Earth. It recognizes
          that we are the Earth. It understands that care of the Earth is care
          for ourselves, and that its health reflects that of our own. The OSE
          offers a great opportunity for us to come together to not only solve
          the problems that face our existence but to become more fully
          human…..the more fully human we become, the more we’ll embrace a
          manner of living that is sustainable, communal, affable, loving, kind,
          and compassionate.”—Broderick Rodell, PhD, ND, whose passions include
          capoeira and yoga along with other learning systems to awaken values
          that support human evolutionary consciousness
        </p>
        <p>
          “The idea and vision to have a spiritual order to celebrate, heal, and
          protect Mother Earth is a gallant one. To dedicate ourselves to this
          community will require deep prayer and the practice of nonviolence as
          we witness the destruction of our planet…..I hear the earth crying for
          people to rise up and act as if every decision we make will either
          destroy or protect the planet….The OSE is asking us to serve, give
          back, to become part of a spiritual order. They ask us to hope….I
          commit to defending mother Earth and to being in circle with those who
          say 'yes' to this vision.”—Deborah Santana, activist for peace and
          social justice and documentary filmmaker
        </p>
        <p>
          “As I turn the last page of Matthew’s, Skylar’s and Jennifer’s
          writing, my heart leaps with a sound ‘Yes!’ One year and a half ago,
          when I started contributing to the Italian Association for creation
          spirituality, I did so out of a desire to bring the experience of the
          sacred out of the cage in which it has been convicted by both
          religious fundamentalism and materialistic atheism, and I intuitively
          feel that OSE may be just what we need to accomplish this….Many of us
          have lost a framework where our ‘experience of the sacred’ can get
          nurtured, cultivated, and hence bear fruit.…OSE, as I understand it,
          is precisely such a framework: its openness to all wisdom traditions,
          its independence from all dogmas, together with its being deeply
          rooted in what we all share—a life-on this wondrous planet—can thus be
          the key to open the cage.”—Claudia Picardi, seeker, scientist and
          teacher born and living in Italy who is foremost a person who is
          constantly striving for creative, spiritual, and intellectual freedom
