          ><br /><br />Welcome to a record of the damned. "By damned," wrote
          Charles Fort in 1919, "I mean the excluded. We shall have a procession
          of the data that Science has excluded."<br /><br />Fort's record of
          the unknown was one of the first to expose us to visitors from space,
          monsters, poltergeists, and floating islands. Frogs fall from the sky.
          Mysterious airships take flight in an age before the airplane. People
          disappear, reappear, and spontaneously combust. <br /><br />This
          stand-alone, handsome edition exposes today's readers to the core work
          of Fort's extraordinary career--in which he pushed us to ask: What is
          out there?

          "To me no one in the world has suggested the underlying depths and
          mysteries and possibilities as has Fort. To me he is simply
          stupendous." --<b>Theodore Dreiser</b><br /><br />"The
          <i>enfant terrible</i> of science." --<i><b>The New York Times</b></i
          ><br /><br />"<i><b>The Book of the Damned</b></i> whispered that
          there was something very wrong with how we thought about the world.
          Fort deliberately pushed his 'damned facts' on his readers, insisting
          that science had constructed its convenienttheories only by ignoring
          those facts that gave us trouble." --<b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Born in Albany, New York, on August 6, 1874, <b>CHARLES FORT</b> made
          his life's work the study of unexplained phenomena. After achieving
          modest success as a short story writer and novelist, Fort began
          studying anomalous phenomena. In 1919 he published his landmark of
          paranormal exploration, <i>The Book of the Damned</i>, which
          influenced generations of writers. Fort moved to London in 1924 to
          consult the archives at the British Museum, then returned to the
          United States in 1926. At the New York Public Library he continued his
          research into spontaneous combustion, space ships, poltergeists, and
          other experiences and events that had been written off by science.
          Fort published three additional books on the unexplained:
          <i>New Lands</i> (1923),<i> Lo!</i> (1931), and
          <i>Wild Talents </i>(1932).&nbsp; Though his work attracted
          controversy, Fort was celebrated in <i>The New York Times </i>as "the
          <i>enfant terrible</i> of science" and he counted novelist Theodore
          Dreiser among his closest friends and literary admirers. Fort's name
          was made into an adjective--<i>fortean</i>--to describe strange
          phenomena. A lasting influence on the evolution of science fiction as
          well as science, Fort stands as one of the most fascinating and
          polarizing figures in all of Americana. He died on May 3, 1932, in New
          York City.
