            >If life is about the journey and not the destination, could it be
            that <i>this</i> is heaven—this physical life we are living here on
            Earth?&nbsp;<br /></b
          ><br />What we experience in our daily lives often feels like anything
          <i>but</i> heaven. But what if we understood how powerful we are—that
          we are powerful enough to mold both our internal and our external
          reality?<br /><br />Anita Moorjani, the
          <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Dying to Be Me</i>, is
          convinced we can do exactly that. The process, she explains, requires
          dismantling many cultural myths mistaken for indisputable truths.
          Beliefs such as "We get what we deserve," "Loving ourselves is
          selfish," and "Coincidences are just that—coincidences," are ingrained
          within us from birth, pervasive and influential, leading to
          generations of misguidance.<br /><br />Following her near-death
          experience, Moorjani began to embody truths she learned in the other
          realm, discovering that letting go of these outmoded myths allowed her
          to experience heaven not as a physical place but as a state of mind,
          right here and right now. In this examination of our common myths, she
          shares stories and examples from her own life, revealing the lies
          beneath the surface of what she was taught and absorbed. By freeing
          ourselves from these falsehoods, Moorjani asserts, we can leave fear,
          heartache, and self-imposed boundaries behind and instead live lives
          full of purpose and joy.

          “So many people have such a fear of death that they are afraid to live
          life to its fullest measure. Anita Moorjani does a brilliant job of
          demystifying both life and death by first breaking the spell of our
          conditioned beliefs and then giving us the practical tools to be
          reborn in the same life. This book will free your soul and teach you
          that you don’t have to die to go to heaven.”&nbsp;<br /><b

            >You Are the Placebo</i
          ><br /><br />“The richest literature on near-death experiences moves
          beyond mere descriptions of the afterlife. The greatest lessons
          concern how to live this life to the fullest. In her newest
          book,&nbsp;<i>What If This Is Heaven?</i>, Anita Moorjani addresses
          deeply held misconceptions in our modern global culture. Her evolving
          wisdom empowers readers toward much greater health and harmony: to
          truly love oneself in the face of life’s challenges is integral to
          every human’s fulfillment here on earth.”&nbsp;<br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          Anita Moorjani was born in Singapore of Indian parents, moved to Hong
          Kong at the age of two, and lived in Hong Kong until she moved to the
          United States in 2015. Because of her background and British
          education, she is multilingual and grew up speaking English,
          Cantonese, and an Indian dialect simultaneously. Anita worked in the
          corporate world for many years before being diagnosed with cancer in
          April 2002.<br />
          Her fascinating and moving near-death experience (NDE) in early 2006
          tremendously changed her perspective on life, and her work is now
          ingrained with the depths and insights she gained while in the other
          realm. She, and her miraculous story, were discovered by Dr Wayne Dyer
          who fostered her entrance into the world of public speaking, and urged
          her to write a book about her experience. And following his lead,
          Anita wrote her first book, Dying to be Me, and it reached the New
          York Times Best Seller list. Since then her two other books "What if
          this is Heaven" and "Sensitive is the New Strong" have reached
          significant acclaim. As a result of her NDE, Anita is often invited to
          speak at conferences and events around the globe to share her
          insights. From her Social Media channels to her live workshops, Anita
          demonstrates that she is the embodiment of the truth that we all have
          the inner power and wisdom to overcome even the most adverse
          situations.<br />
          Anita currently lives in California with her husband, and together
          they continue to share the messages that mean most to Anita through
          her books, social media platforms, online Sanctuary and retreats and
          workshops. Today, Anita is a contemporary activist for love and peace,
          sharing what she learned on the other side through her videos, books,
          and speeches.
