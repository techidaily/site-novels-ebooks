              >Do you struggle with symptoms of anxiety, depression, or both?
              You may be tired of feeling overwhelmed and unable to function.
              You may long to interact with family and friends and move beyond
              anxiety and depression valleys.</strong
            >
            Then, the 30-day devotional Panic to Peace by Tricia Opitz is a
            must-read for you. This book promises you hope, help, and healing in
            your distress. You will relate to Tricia's personal stories from her
            experience with anxiety and depression. The Holy Spirit will use the
            Bible verses she references, which comforted her, to speak to your
            needs.
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            Sufferers of anxiety or depression disorders aren't alone. According
            to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), anxiety
            disorders are the most common mental illnesses in the United States,
            affecting 40 million adults annually. The ADAA also says that 264
            million people worldwide live with depression. Men and women of all
            ages suffer from these psychological issues.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Misery may love company, but knowing others suffer doesn't help you
            feel better. It doesn't assist you in climbing out of the valleys of
            anxiety and depression. That's why Tricia wrote Panic to Peace.
            You'll find encouragement for each day on every page, and you'll
            make progress toward mental wellness as you respond to action steps.
            There is also room to write down your reactions and reflections on
            the journal lines. That helps relieve tension. Writing in a journal
            allows you to put your thoughts on paper where you can see and deal
            with them.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Music often calms the anxious soul and cheers a discouraged heart,
            so Tricia has included an appendix of encouraging songs and hymns
            that cheered her. Her prayers at the end of each devotion lead you
            to put your heart cries into words you can bring to God. He hears
            you, loves you, and promises to heal the brokenhearted.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            Pick up Panic to Peace, 30 Days of Hope to jump-start your progress
            from anxiety and depression toward peace. Or consider sharing with
            someone who suffers.

          I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which is a treasure trove of hope for
          those troubled with anxiety, depression, or both. The author shares
          her experience with both and encourages the reader to hope in the
          Lord, be patient while healing occurs, and rely on the Lord in dark
          times. Even when we don't feel Him present, He is. Reading her story
          of trial to triumph greatly encouraged me. I highly recommend this
          book even if you don't struggle with anxiety or depression. It is a
          message of God's goodness and instills hope in the reader.

          I loved Tricia Opitz's new book, Panic to Peace. Her love of books is
          translated from handling others' writing and being that quiet voice of
          guidance in the library to writing devotions encouraging others to
          find victory through depression and anxiety. As a Pastor, I was
          especially blessed by her testimony that she was moved to write by her
          Pastor's sermon one Sunday. In her own words, she says, "Your battle
          with depression, anxiety, or panic may seem like it won't end, but I
          believe it will. One step at a time, one day at a time, God will show
          you more about the beautiful life He has planned for you." I highly
          recommend you take this 30-day devotional journey to hope and healing.

          I bought this book as I have suffered from depression, panic
          disorders, and anxiety. It has encouraged me to know that Tricia has
          also walked this road and recovered with God's help and healing. With
          scriptures, a prayer, and advice for your next steps each day, this
          book is like having a friend share her journey with you...giving you
          hope that you, too, can go from panic to peace.

          Tricia understands what it means to lose hope, but through her book,
          Panic to Peace, she offers hope through a 30-day devotional, sharing
          her own stories and directing us to the Bible, where we can find hope.

          Tricia offers powerful words of encouragement and hope for all who
          experience depression and anxiety on this life journey. She provides a
          candid look into her journal and reflections on what helped her find
          her way out of her mental crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crediting God's blessings of scripture, medicine, and faith, she is
          living proof of HOPE for healing amid the mental health crisis many
          face today.

          Tricia Opitz candidly shares her struggles with anxiety and
          depression, a rapidly growing societal issue affecting all ages. She
          offers devotions, suggested activities, and journal pages to support
          and guide those who battle these mental health issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there are no quick fixes, Tricia's insights provide a valuable
          tool to help others cope with these challenges.
