          Explores the role of magic and the occult in art and culture from
          ancient times to today <br /><br />• Examines key figures behind
          esoteric cultural developments, such as Carl Jung, Anton LaVey, Paul
          Bowles, Aleister Crowley, and Rudolf Steiner <br /><br />• Explores
          the history of magic as a source of genuine counter culture and
          compares it with our contemporary soulless, digital monoculture
          <br /><br />• Reveals how the magic of art can be restored if art is
          employed as a means rather than an end and offers strategies to
          rekindle intuitive creativity <br /><br />Art, magic, and the occult
          have been intimately linked since our prehistoric ancestors created
          the first cave paintings some 50,000 years ago. As civilizations
          developed, these esoteric forces continued to drive culture forward,
          both visibly and behind the scenes, from the Hermetic ideas of the
          Renaissance, to the ethereal worlds of 19th century Symbolism, to the
          occult interests of the Surrealists. <br /><br />In this deep
          exploration of “occulture”--the liminal space where art and magic
          meet--Carl Abrahamsson reveals the integral role played by magic and
          occultism in the development of culture throughout history as well as
          their relevance to the continuing survival of art and creativity.
          Blending magical history and esoteric philosophy with his more than 30
          years’ experience in occult movements, Abrahamsson looks at the
          phenomena and people who have been seminal in modern esoteric
          developments, including Carl Jung, Anton LaVey, Paul Bowles, Aleister
          Crowley, and Rudolf Steiner. <br /><br />Showing how art and magic
          were initially one and the same, the author explores the history of
          magic as a source of genuine counter culture and compares it with our
          contemporary soulless, digital monoculture. He reveals how the magic
          of art can be restored if art is employed as a means rather than an
          end--if it is intense, emotional, violent, and expressive--and offers
          strategies for creating freely, magically, even spontaneously, with
          intent unfettered by the whims of trends, a creative practice akin to
          chaos magick that assists both creators and spectators to live with
          meaning. He also looks at intuition and creativity as the cornerstones
          of genuine individuation, explaining how insights and illuminations
          seldom come in collective forms. <br /><br />Exploring magical
          philosophy, occult history, the arts, psychology, and the colorful
          grey areas in between, Abrahamsson reveals the culturally and
          magically transformative role of art and the ways the occult continues
          to transform culture to this day.

          "It's a pleasure to read essays that are both demystifying, they are
          written in a truly free thinking mode that invites your own input,
          encourages it from the point of view where all the platitudes and
          traps of magical, cliquey thinking have no place. But most of all,
          Carl's book holds a very clear and distinctive message-a message of
          encouragement to steer away from soulless, digital monoculture of now
          to open yourself to sublayers of realities that can help us to
          rejuvenate into the kaleidoscope of emotions, self-integrating trip to
          express our own voice."
