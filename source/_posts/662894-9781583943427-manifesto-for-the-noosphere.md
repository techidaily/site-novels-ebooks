          The noosphere, identified in the early twentieth century as intrinsic
          to the next stage of human and terrestrial evolution, is defined as
          the Earth’s “mental sphere” or stratum of human thought.&nbsp;<i
            >Manifesto for the Noosphere, </i
          >the final work by renowned<i>&nbsp;</i>author José&nbsp;Argüelles,
          predicts that the noosphere will be fully accessed on December 21,
          2012—but warns that we will only successfully make this evolutionary
          jump through an act of collective consciousness among humans on Earth.
          The ascension to the noosphere or Supermind (using the terminology of
          Sri Aurobindo), Argüelles says, will be an unprecedented “mind shift”
          that mirrors the emergence of life itself on the planet. <br /><i
            ><br />Manifesto for the Noosphere </i
          >is intended to inform and prepare humanity for the nature and
          magnitude of this shift. Argüelles brings in the Mayan long-count
          calendar, radical theories on the nature of time, advanced states of
          consciousness, and the possible intervention of galactic intelligence.
          He carefully details the role of the noosphere in relation to other
          planetary strata (hydrosphere, biosphere, atmosphere) as well as the
          history and nature of the biosphere-noosphere transition and the
          intermediary phases of the technosphere and cybersphere.<br /><br /><b

          “José Argüelles’s last book is appropriately called a manifesto. I
          hope that it is in fact a premonitory description and that his vision
          of connection and oneness will come to pass—otherwise, our future
          looks dark indeed. Argüelles clearly believes we will make the
          transition to full humanity, fulfilling our promise and evolutionary
          destiny. His huge confidence and deep wisdom combine to make a
          remarkable vision seem not only attractive but attainable. Read this.
          It will help forge your linkage into a critical mass of truly human
          beings.”

          "José Argüelles's contribution to our critical time is truly unique.
          He combines deep spiritual insight with a sense for the reality and
          urgency of acting on that insight. His "manifesto" is a veritable
          bible of the deep dimension of the worldshift in which we now find
          ourselves. It should be read by all awakened humans, and all who wish
          to wake up and participate in the greatest attempt ever to consciously
          steer the evolution of our not only biological and social but also
          spiritual species."

          vital guide to making the shift from the biosphere to the noosphere,
          the next stage in the evolution of Earth consciousness. He integrates
          the work of Teilhard de Chardin, Sri Aurobindo, and the Mayans with
          Russia scientists' "cosmism," looking at issues of planetary and
          universal evolution as a function of the emergence of "living
          intellectual matter," synchronized by cosmic mind. This is a work of
          immense importance and encouragement for us all." <br /><b

        </h4>
        <p>
          José Argüelles (1939–2011) gained international acclaim in 1987 with
          his book&nbsp;<i>The</i> <i>Mayan Factor,&nbsp;</i>which introduced
          the concept of a transformative 2012&nbsp;to the mass consciousness.
          In 2009 Argüelles&nbsp;convened the First Noosphere World Forum, a
          series of synchronized bioregional congresses, and won the Nicholas
          Roerich Peace Medallion in 2010 for lifetime effort in promoting peace
          through culture.
