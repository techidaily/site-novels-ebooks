          “By the study, experimentation and practice of natural healing, women
          are changing and charting the future of health care. Despite heavy
          resistance or lack of recognition from patriarchal medicine, they are
          nevertheless making positive changes that will continue and increase.
          Women’s emphasis on one-to-one work practiced in mutual agreement and
          participation is very different from mechanized and big-money
          medicine, and has results and successes far beyond expectations. The
          emphasis on self-healing returns health care to the consumer, to
          women’s lives and bodies, for the first time in centuries. The medical
          system cannot control a movement held in the hands of women, though it
          may try. Women are taking control again of healing, our
          daughter-right, for the first time since the matriarchies and the
          Inquisition.”—from the Introduction

        </h4>
        <p>
          DIANE STEIN is a popular and acclaimed healer and the best-selling
          author of Essential Reiki and 25 other books in the fields of
          metaphysical healing, women's spirituality, and alternative health.
          She lives and teaches in Florida.<br /><br />THE AUTHOR SCOOP<br /><br />Read
          any good books lately?<br />My favorite reading is science fiction,
          there are new good books coming out every day.&nbsp; Look at Sharon
          Shinn, Tamora Pierce, Ann Bishop, and so many more talented women
          fiction writers.<br /><br />If you had to boil your book's message
          down to one sentence, what would it be?<br />Serve the Light, trust
          the Light, make a difference in the world with who you are and what
          you do.<br /><br />What are you working on now?<br />I prefer to keep
          future books a secret until they are finished.&nbsp; No one will know
          until the manuscript is mailed in.<br /><br />Do you eat your
          vegetables?<br />I have been a vegetarian since 1983.&nbsp; I do eat
          my vegetables.<br /><br />If you had a superpower, what would it
          be?<br />Wonder Woman, of course.<br /><br />How long did it take you
          to write this book?<br />I have been working with herbs for over 35
          years, so you could say it took that long to write it.
