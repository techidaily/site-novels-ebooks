            >A practical and in-depth manual on integrating Thelemic spiritual
            principles into daily life by a prominent writer and teacher of the
            occult and the work of Aleister Crowley.</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          In <i>The Way of the Will</i>, David Shoemaker explores how the
          spiritual discipline of Thelema, founded by Aleister Crowley
          (1875–1947), can be utilized to enhance your psychological and
          spiritual growth. The book grew out of the author’s own teaching and
          experience—podcast episodes, classes, and of course, many years of
          personal practice and supervision of other initiates. It is a
          compendium of useful tools and perspectives designed to serve as one
          of many useful guides in the magician’s library. Part one of the book,
          “Thelema and the Life Within,” reflects on the ways your inner
          experience can be enhanced by tools such as the Qabalistic Tree of
          Life, Qabalistic psychology, and the symbolic world of astrology. In
          part two, “Thelemic Practice in Detail,” several important (but rarely
          discussed) libers in the Thelemic corpus are reviewed, with an eye
          toward strengthening the use of these powerful practices with
          no-nonsense advice. Tips are shared for constructing powerful,
          customized magical invocations and coping with the inevitable ordeals
          that can impact you along the path of your Great Work. Part two will
          also examine the deeper, personal magick accessible via attendance of
          the Gnostic Mass and the ways the symbolic frameworks of the original
          Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn can be (and have been) adapted to
          express and enhance Thelemic principles and practices. Part three,
          “Thelema in the Wider World,” reviews the ways in which the Thelemic
          path can inform your health, your creativity, your sense of
          connectedness and meaning, and your experience of the nature of life
          itself. Various opportunities for community engagement and training in
          Thelemic magick and mysticism that exist in today’s world are
          explored, as well as the ways in which these have evolved since
          Crowley’s time. <br />
          David also offers a personal memoir of his own path toward awareness
          of True Will, including his experience of the “Knowledge and
          Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel”—the term often used by
          Crowley to describe the pivotal spiritual awakening potentially
          available to every human being.
