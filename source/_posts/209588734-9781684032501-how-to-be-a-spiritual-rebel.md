              internationally renowned teacher Jac O’Keeffe offers the keys to

            Do you ever feel flawed, anxious, or afraid—like something is
            holding you back, but you’re not sure what? The truth is, we can
            <i>all </i>feel that way sometimes (or even most of the time!).
            We’re trapped by a limited sense of self, held back by our own
            anxieties, fears, and compulsions. Mindfulness can offer
            intermittent relief from these contrived narratives, showing us how
            to be present, open, and available in the moment by observing our
            thoughts and feelings. This is all wonderful—until the fears and
            doubts sneak back in.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>How to Be a Spiritual Rebel</i> offers more than simple
            mindfulness. If you want more than a temporary fix,
            <i>Spiritual Rebel</i> will lead you out of your mind games
            completely. Drawing on spiritual practices and recent findings in
            neuroscience, this groundbreaking guide will help you examine the
            psychological barriers that block your spiritual growth and keep you
            from embracing true liberation.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll learn to cultivate courage, view your thoughts and feelings
            without letting them define you, and find guidance and support as
            you navigate the route to boundless freedom without fear. Anecdotes
            and exercises are given to awaken your inner capacity to see beyond
            the world created by your mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’re ready to take mindfulness—and spirituality—to the next
            level and experience true freedom and fulfillment, this candid,
            sometimes discombobulating, entertaining, and jargon-free guide will
            point the way.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b>Jac O’Keeffe</b> experienced a spontaneous awakening in 1997. This
          gave her access to powerful, intuitive, and healing capacities, and
          influenced her change in career, from pioneering community arts policy
          at the national level in Ireland to opening a healing practice. She
          worked closely with a team of medical doctors researching the
          spiritual causes underpinning clinical depression. The findings
          culminated in a residential program that O’Keeffe developed, which
          successfully treated depression. In 2003, she left Ireland to deepen
          her spiritual practice. After a two-year period of no thoughts, the
          self-referencing mechanism that creates the sense of a personal “I”
          had dissolved. O’Keeffe began to work as a spiritual teacher in 2008.
          She now guides others in her teachings and publications in order to
          share what she has learned, and assists others to transcend both dual
          and non-dual perspectives. She also prepares those who have had
          sustained spiritual awakenings for liberation.
