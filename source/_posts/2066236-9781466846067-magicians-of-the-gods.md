            Graham Hancock's multi-million bestseller Fingerprints of the Gods
            remains an astonishing, deeply controversial, wide-ranging
            investigation of the mysteries of our past and the evidence for
            Earth's lost civilization. Twenty years on, Hancock returns with the
            sequel to his seminal work filled with completely new, scientific
            and archaeological evidence, which has only recently come to
            light...<br /><br />Near the end of the last Ice Age 12,800 years
            ago, a giant comet that had entered the solar system from deep space
            thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of
            these struck the Earth causing a global cataclysm on a scale unseen
            since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the
            fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments
            hit the northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments
            a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated
            huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidized millions of square
            kilometers of ice, destabilizing the Earth's crust and causing the
            global Deluge that is remembered in myths all around the world. A
            second series of impacts, equally devastating, causing further
            cataclysmic flooding, occurred 11,600 years ago, the exact date that
            Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis.
            <br /><br />The evidence revealed in this book shows beyond
            reasonable doubt that an advanced civilization that flourished
            during the Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between
            12,800 and 11,600 years ago. But there were survivors - known to
            later cultures by names such as 'the Sages', 'the Magicians', 'the
            Shining Ones', and 'the Mystery Teachers of Heaven'. They travelled
            the world in their great ships doing all in their power to keep the
            spark of civilization burning. They settled at key locations -
            Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, Baalbek in the Lebanon, Giza in Egypt,
            ancient Sumer, Mexico, Peru and across the Pacific where a huge
            pyramid has recently been discovered in Indonesia. Everywhere they
            went these 'Magicians of the Gods' brought with them the memory of a
            time when mankind had fallen out of harmony with the universe and
            paid a heavy price. A memory and a warning to the future...<br /><br />For
            the comet that wrought such destruction between 12,800 and 11,600
            years may not be done with us yet. Astronomers believe that a
            20-mile wide 'dark' fragment of the original giant comet remains
            hidden within its debris stream and threatens the Earth. An
            astronomical message encoded at Gobekli Tepe, and in the Sphinx and
            the pyramids of Egypt,warns that the 'Great Return' will occur in
            our time...

          "Author Graham Hancock's new book Magicians of the Gods is a triumph
          of investigation, intuition and interpretation. Deeply immersed in an
          ocean of new scientific and archaeological discoveries and yet
          prescient enough to conceive of humanity's mysterious development and
          humble place in the universe, Hancock weaves a multidisciplinary
          thread that connects oral traditions, the mystery of place and time
          with contemporary scientific observations and evidence....A
          masterpiece of penitentiary distillation, intuitive speculation and
          multidisciplinary perspective, Magicians of the Gods comes with the
          highest recommendation." - <i>New Dawn</i> on
          <i>Magicians of the Gods</i><br /><br />“Ingenious.” —<i
            >Kirkus Reviews on Magicians of the Gods</i
          ><br /><br /><i>"Magicians of the Gods</i> schools the attentive
          reader in exotic locales and colourful (often thwarted) characters,
          dusty ancient knowledge and pristine contemporary science and theory.
          Hancock's passionate, detailed prose transports us around the globe
          and across millennia in an accessible and direct manner.: -
          <i>New Dawn </i>on <i>Magicians of the Gods</i><br /><br />"Hancock
          does a magnificent job of proving beyond reasonable doubt that an
          advanced civilization, which flourished during the Ice Age, was
          destroyed in global cataclysms between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago."
          —Atlantis Rising on <i>Magicians of the Gods</i><br /><br />“A reading
          experience of pure gold...History buffs, Bible scholars, anyone who
          likes a great intellectual detective yarn will plunge into The Sign
          and the Seal and not come up for air until the end.” —<i
            >Seattle Times on The Sign and the Seal</i
          ><br /><br />“Intriguing and entertaining and sturdy enough to give a
          long pause for thought.” —<i
            >Kirkus Reviews on Fingerprints of the Gods</i
          ><br /><br />"I do so recommend this book. Hancock is an enchanting
          writer, and such a curious and thoughtful and intuitive investigator
          of the mysteries." - Anne Rice, author of
          <i>Interview with a Vampire </i>
