            The Occult Anatomy of Man by noted writer, lecturer, and mystic
            Manly Palmer Hall seeks to explain the nature of the universe by
            looking inward - into the human body itself.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            As the author of over 150 books, pamphlets, and essays, Hall was a
            major voice in mystic and metaphysical circles. He rose to
            prominence in 1928 with the release of his most famous work, The
            Secret Teachings of All Ages. While continuing to write and give
            extensive lectures in California, Hall also founded the
            Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles in 1934. The center is
            still in operation today, providing guidance and wisdom to those who
            seek it.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            One of Hall's early works is The Occult Anatomy of Man, in which
            Hall interprets the human body as the allegorical answer to the
            mysteries of the universe.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Hall begins by reminding us that the holy writings of most
            "enlightened people" include some version of the concept that God
            made man in His own image. From this beginning, The Occult Anatomy
            of Man explores the idea that as a microcosm of the infinite, the
            human body contains the answers to the secrets of the universe. Hall
            states, "[The priests of the ancient world] believed that every star
            in the heavens, every element in the earth, and every function in
            Nature was represented by a corresponding center, pole or activity
            within the human body."
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Unsurprisingly, Hall takes issue with literalists and historians and
            their interpretations of sacred texts. "Those who understand [the
            Bible's] literal meaning understand the least of its meaning." To
            illustrate, he describes some of the symbolism in the Bible and lays
            out their paganistic roots:
          </p>
          <p>
            "The Christian cross comes from Egypt and India; the triple mitre
            from the faith of the Mithraics; the shepherd's crook from the
            Hermetic Mysteries and Greece; the Immaculate Conception from
            India..."
          </p>
          <p><br /></p>
          <p>
            In our inability to comprehend the vastness of the universe, the
            great spiritual leaders instead turned inward, looking to that which
            we could understand to explain that which we cannot. By viewing man
            as a microcosm of the great cosmos, we can better comprehend the
            unknowable.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The universe is divided into three parts in nearly all spiritual
            belief systems - heaven, earth, and a hell or underworld. The
            heavens are on high, where God resides and looks down upon us. When
            we pray, we raise our eyes and hands toward heaven. Earth is the
            middle ground, suspended and connected to both heaven and hell. And
            hell lies below.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            The human body, Hall argues, follows the same pattern. The "skull
            with its divine contents" is the heaven of the physical form. The
            spinal column with its 33 vertebrae is the earth, connecting the
            heavens to what lies below. Jesus Christ, God's son sent to earth
            for 33 years, is not coincidental. Some ancients referred to the
            spine as the stairway, or a winding road leading where? To the skull
            - to heaven. And below are the reproductive organs representing hell
            or the underworld, the source of our emotional and sexual impulses.
            This is the furthest from the brain and from our divinity.
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>
            Through extensive study of world religions and cultural traditions
            from both East and West, Hall explains the wisdom of the ancients in
            this short book. For those curious about man's connection to nature
            and to the wider universe, The Occult Anatomy of Man is a
            foundational work.
