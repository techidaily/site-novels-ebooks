            In <i>Mediums Rare</i>, horror and science fiction novelist Richard
            Matheson shares a personal project inspired by his lifelong interest
            in all things paranormal. Here is a brief account of psychic
            beginnings, covering subjects like telepathy, ESP, paranormal
            activity, and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parapsychology, today, utilizes highly advanced methodology. It has,
            long since, left behind the era of dim-lit parlors and spiritual
            melodramatics. It is, now, a completely legitimate field of study
            based upon precise and sophisticated test procedures. But it began
            quite differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matheson takes readers on a journey through paranormal history,
            beginning in Greek antiquity and making his way toward renowned
            American psychic Edgar Cayce. Along the way, he recounts episodes
            like the Margaret and Kate Fox, young sisters who, in 1848,
            convinced others they were in touch with ghosts in a haunted house.
            There’s also Civil War-era medium Nettie Colburn who aided President
            Lincoln and may have channeled Daniel Webster. Other episodes
            include New England mediums “Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Piper” and the
            great magician Harry Houdini.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Richard Matheson (1926–2013) was a prolific speculative fiction author
          and screenwriter who wrote novels, short stories, movie screenplays,
          and scripts for television. He is perhaps best known for I Am Legend,
          a novel that was translated to the silver screen twice-once starring
          Charlton Heston, and once starring Will Smith. His screenplay The
          Incredible Shrinking Man, based on a prior novel, won the Hugo Award
          in 1958. Several other novels of Matheson's have been adapted to film,
          including What Dreams May Come, A Stir of Echoes, Duel, and Hell
          House. The movie version of Duel, based on a Matheson short story of
          the same name, was directed by Steven Spielberg. He is also known for
          writing dozens of episodes for The Twilight Zone, including the iconic
          "Nightmare at 20,000 Feet," and several popular Star Trek episodes,
          including "The Enemy Within." In addition to the Hugo Award, Richard
          Matheson was the recipient of the World Fantasy Award for Life
          Achievement (1984) and an Edgar Award for a teleplay written for The
          Night Stalker. He was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame
          in 2010.
