            >What was happening? Everything I tried was going wrong. I needed to
            start again, get my life back.&nbsp; Would it be possible to change
            the events of my life, was there some basic flaw in me? “There was a
            veiled past which I could not see, there was a door to which I had
            not key.” How would it be possible? </i
          >We've all been there: An impasse, a crossroads, an unmarked door—or
          some asymmetry in the weave of life that leaves us stuck at worst,
          though at best in question. So too begins Rod Bull’s ribald, funny,
          drunken, irreverent memoir of a seemingly accidental spiritual life,
          with a constant refrain to “dirty work”—shoveling manure in a stable
          or bilge water in the belly of a ship, or cutting cane and viciously
          cut, the only cure to which is to urinate on yourself… Bull’s is a
          life of pratfalls, comic encounters (with an angry Jim Brown, the
          running back, in London, with sundry Tibetan Tulkus or with the
          tutelary heads of the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky Work) and hard won insights.
          What is of particular note is that here you read the story of no man
          soaring from height to golden height but an honest recounting and
          recollecting, blemishes and all, of a life of the spirit via serious
          hard traveling. <i>Dirty Work: A Chump’s Search for Meaning</i> is a
          memoir of crazy wisdom.

        </h4>
        <p>
          Normal0falsefalsefalseEN-USX-NONEX-NONERod Bull was born and raised in
          London, England. From a young age he resisted the confines of
          traditional expectations and fled to far and foreign regions to
          broaden his horizon as a coming of age. After he&nbsp;hitched hiked
          his way through Europe, the Middle East and India he "settled" down in
          Australia to indulge in the common culture he so earlier rejected
          taking on odd jobs as a sugar cane cutter, oil seaman and a mental
          health orderly and the not so mundane&nbsp;pursuits of deep sea diving
          and ski instructing.&nbsp; Years later he came back to London to
          pursue a career in&nbsp;photography where he worked as a
          freelancer&nbsp;for Mobil oil then later published his first book Time
          Stands Still, a&nbsp;pictorial on the stone circles of the United
          Kingdom and France. As his photography career grew so did his
          spiritual quest which led him to the teachings of Gurdjieff and
          Tibetan&nbsp;Buddhism. During his later London years he started a
          family and eventually moved to upstate New York where currently
          resides.
