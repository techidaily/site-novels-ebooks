          <p>
            In <i>Old World Witchcraft</i>, noted author Raven Grimassi covers
            totally new territory--in his work and in the world of popular
            witchcraft books published in the last few decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is actually about “an enchanted worldview,” one that has
            not necessarily been inherited from the beliefs and practices of any
            particular region and one which is available to us today.
          </p>
          <p>
            The “Old World” in the title is actually about a magical view of the
            Plant Kingdom and the spirits attached to it. While Grimassi’s
            previous books discuss the cultural expressions and commonality of
            witchcraft beliefs and practices in general, this book penetrates
            much deeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Old World Witchdraft</i> reveals rarely discussed topics such as
            the concept of Shadow as the organic memory of the earth. Readers
            will learn rooted techniques that possess power because these ways
            have always been connected to it. They will learn methods of
            interfacing with the ancestral current and with the organic memory
            of the earth. Through these they can connect with the timeless arts
            and learn methods of empowerment directly from the ancient source.
          </p>
          <p>
            Totally new information about familiar tools is presented. For
            example, the mortar and pestle is a tool for spell casting, a device
            that creates interfacing with plant spirits and with shadow, and a
            focal point for veneration of the Plant Kingdom. Grimassi also
            presents the art of using plant ashes for magical sigil work.
          </p>
          <p>
            This book is for people who have had their fill of books that say
            the same things over and over, who want to take the next step, and
            who are eager for the more rooted ways that have remained largely
            hidden.

        <p>
          "Grimassi (Encyclopedia of Wicca and Witchcraft) has written over a
          dozen books on neo¬paganism and witchcraft and is a self-styled expert
          on non-Celtic European witchcraft. In this title, he refutes current
          concepts of what witchcraft is and has been, dismissing most scholarly
          work as dependent on either the testimony of tortured victims of the
          Inquisition or the writings of those seeking to justify their
          persecution of witches. He also appears to disdain Wicca as the
          fanciful imaginings of the Victorians. Having made these points,
          Grimassi moves on to share the plant magic that is the basis of the
          "Old World Witchcraft" taught to him by hereditary witches—whose
          teachings, apparently, emanated originally from the faery realm. (Take
          that, scholars!) He lays out a complex schema informed by an "Old
          World" understanding of the sacred hallow and the use of shadow, the
          organic memory of the earth. The second half of the book is full of
          detailed spells, charms, correspondences, and rituals.
          <b>VERDICT</b> Readers of this book will most likely be experienced
          witches looking to further their spiritual studies and dedicated to
          parsing the magical prescriptions to suit their own purposes." —Janet
          Tapper, Univ. of Western States, Portland, OR, <i>Library Journal</i>,
