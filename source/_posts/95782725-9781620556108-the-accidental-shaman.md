          A story of awakening to remarkable shamanic powers, teachings, and
          techniques<br /><br />• Describes the author’s work with plant
          spirits, entheogens such as ayahuasca, and indigenous shamans during
          his 20 years of fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon<br /><br />• Explores
          the practice of soul retrieval and shamanic work with feathers,
          stones, and sound<br /><br />• Includes techniques for exploring
          non-ordinary reality, exercises for expanding sensory perception, and
          practices to open your creative artistic visionary potential<br /><br />After
          surviving a serious elevator crash in London, Howard G. Charing found
          he had developed healing touch as well as the ability to hear voices
          and experience visions--just as a healer in Italy had predicted only a
          week before the accident. He began using his abilities to heal but
          felt he needed more guidance and training. He first connected with a
          national spiritual healing organization, only to be told he was doing
          everything wrong. Then, through a friend, he discovered shamanism.<br /><br />Sharing
          profound teachings and extraordinary experiences from his more than 30
          years of shamanic healing work, Charing explains how he accidentally
          became a shaman and completely changed the course of his life. He
          describes his work with plant spirits, entheogens such as ayahuasca,
          and indigenous shamans during his 20 years of fieldwork in the
          Peruvian Amazon, including his studies with the late visionary artist
          Pablo Amaringo. Investigating altered states of perception, he
          provides visionary techniques for exploring non-ordinary reality,
          exercises for expanding sensory perception, and practices to open your
          creative artistic visionary potential. Detailing the practice of soul
          retrieval, the author discusses why it is one of the most effective
          and profound spiritual healing practices and shares emotionally
          charged stories of successful shamanic healings he has attended. He
          also includes shamanic wisdom on working with feathers, stones, and
          sound and compares current research in physics with the vast body of
          experiential knowledge from indigenous spiritual traditions.<br /><br />From
          the accident that started his journey to the many remarkable
          spiritwork encounters that have happened since, Charing’s story will
          empower readers to begin exploring the realms of consciousness and
          energy that surround us and welcome the dissolution of the boundary
          between the physical and the spiritual.
