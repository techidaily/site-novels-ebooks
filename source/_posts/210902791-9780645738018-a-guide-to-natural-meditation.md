          <p>
            These days, most of us have tried meditation in one form or another.
            But few stick with the practice in a meaningful way and most get
            stuck at some point. Why?
          </p>
          <p>
            Almost all approaches to meditation focus on what you should be
            doing and less on the innate wisdom and intelligence already within
            your own body. Mindfulness techniques meant to "get you out of your
            head" just take you deeper into your mind because they are
            thought-based approaches.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Natural meditation</strong>, on the other hand, starts with
            the body. It's based on the premise that everything-emotions,
            thoughts, and feelings-start within the body... and so should your
            meditation. Rather than seeing mental and physical health as
            separate, through this book you'll come to understand them as
            different expressions of the same distress that originates from deep
            within your body. You'll learn how to listen to your body, and in
            doing so, activate the self-healing process from within, allowing
            you to recover from life daily to help sustain and achieve your
            optimal state.
