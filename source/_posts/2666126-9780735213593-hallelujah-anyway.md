            >“Anne Lamott is my Oprah.” <i>—Chicago Tribune</i><br /><br /><b
              >The&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i> bestseller from the author of
              <i>Dusk, Night, Dawn</i>,&nbsp;<i>Almost Everything</i>
              and&nbsp;<i>Bird by Bird</i>, a powerful exploration of mercy and
              how we can embrace it.
            </b></b
          ><br /><br />"Mercy is radical kindness," Anne Lamott writes in her
          enthralling and heartening book, <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i>. It's the
          permission you give others—and yourself—to forgive a debt, to absolve
          the unabsolvable, to let go of the judgment and pain that make life so
          difficult.<br /><br />In
          <i>Hallelujah Anyway: Rediscovering Mercy</i>&nbsp;Lamott ventures to
          explore where to find meaning in life. We should begin, she suggests,
          by "facing a great big mess, especially the great big mess of
          ourselves." It's up to each of us to recognize the presence and
          importance of mercy everywhere—"within us and outside us, all around
          us"—and to use it to forge a deeper understanding of ourselves and
          more honest connections with each other. While that can be difficult
          to do, Lamott argues that it's crucial, as "kindness towards others,
          beginning with myself, buys us a shot at a warm and generous heart,
          the greatest prize of all."&nbsp;<br /><br />Full of Lamott’s
          trademark honesty, humor and forthrightness,
          <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i> is profound and caring, funny and wise—a
          hopeful book of hands-on spirituality.<b><br /><br /></b>

          “Lamott is a superb writer. Her voice is one-of-a-kind: deft, folksy,
          cheerfully hostile... She is witty and funny and smart... Telling
          stories so personal even a distant reader can relate.”
          <i>—The Washington Post</i><br /><br />“This is trademark
          Lamott<i>—</i>theological speculation, hippie slang and domestic
          comedy, C.S. Lewis by way of Janis Joplin by way of Erma Bombeck.”
          <i>—Christian Science Monitor</i><br /><br />“Every writer,
          truth-seeker, parent, and activist I know is in love with one or more
          books by Anne Lamott... she writes as naturally as she breathes, she
          explores the mysterious paths and detours of life itself, and she
          reports back to make the way ahead easier for all of us... I keep
          learning a lot from the clear and great Annie Lamott. I think you
          will, too.” <i>—</i>Gloria Steinem<br /><br />“A clarion call to the
          better angels of our nature.” <i>—Chicago Tribune<br /><br /></i>“A
          hopeful book for the care and feeding of your soul.”<i>
            <i>—</i>Adriana Trigiani, </i
          >author of<i> <i>Kiss Carlo</i></i
          ><br /><br />“Best bathtub read for me would be anything by Anne
          Lamott... She always makes me laugh and she embraces all the broken
          bits.” <i>—</i>Andie McDowell, actress, in <i>W Magazine</i
          ><br /><br />“Mercy is complicated, but&nbsp;<i
            >Hallelujah Anyway&nbsp;</i
          >does a fabulous job of breaking it down so it’s easier to understand.
          And [Lamott] even paints visual pictures of mercy that help
          you&nbsp;<i>feel</i>&nbsp;what mercy is.” <i>—The Huffington Post</i
          ><br /><br /><i>“Hallelujah Anyway: Rediscovering Mercy</i> is a
          breath of fresh literary air. With a caring and understanding tone,
          Lamott takes on the overwhelming negativity in today’s political and
          international culture head-on, and gets hands-on in finding humor and
          hope in between the headlines.” <i>—Pacific Sun<br /></i><br />“Some
          books we read for their delicious plots, but others we savor another
          way. Anne Lamott’s <i>Hallelujah Anyway</i> is one you’ll slow down to
          read, so exactly right are her insights. The way to feel whole, she
          says, is through mercy—an idea as beloved as cheese, yet so tricky
          when you have to apply it to annoying people. But at this exact
          moment, we can all agree: It’s time for kindness.” <i>—Redbook</i
          ><br /><br />“Reading Anne Lamott…is like sitting down with a
          girlfriend you haven’t seen for a while.” <i>—The Washington Post</i
          ><br /><br />“An exploration of mercy as the ultimate&nbsp;and most
          radical brand of kindness.” <i>—</i>Hoda Kotb, Today Show co-host<br /><br />“Not
          a book to miss.” <i>—Library Journal</i><br /><br />“Spiritually
          enhancing, life-affirming lessons . . . delivers flashes of wisdom and
          inspiration that resonate.”<i> —<i>Kirkus </i>Reviews</i

          ><br /><br />“Lamott is beloved by legions for her smart, irreverent
          take on the human condition, filtered through her unique brand of
          compassionate Christianity and delivered with delicious,
          self-deprecating wit. Lamott goes even deeper in these essays.” —<i
            >People <br /><br /></i
          >“Anne Lamott is a cause for celebration. [Her] real genius lies in
          capturing the ineffable, describing not perfect moments, but imperfect
          ones…perfectly. She is nothing short of miraculous.”<i>
            —<i>The New Yorker</i> <br /></i
          ><br />“Lamott is funny, witty and irreverent…Her basic message is
          love and forgiveness…Not a bad message for any faith.” —<i
