              ><i>Living Lunarly</i> is the nature-inspired self-care book
              powered by the cycles of the moon.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            As you follow the lunar cycle, you'll set <b>monthly intentions</b>,
            explore <b>plant care</b>, <b>crystals</b>, and <b>meditation</b>,
            and find new emotional strength in aligning with nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Never has the idea of mindfully checking in with yourself and
            creating a "whole body" health—health that is more than simply the
            absence of illness—been so appealing. This book reveals how
            <b
              >introspection, ritual, and love can help you lead a more
              spiritually fulfilling life</b
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will learn how to use the phases of the moon to guide you in
            your intention-setting practice. As the moon waxes and wanes, use it
            to set a path of persistent self-reflection. Suggested
            <b>practices and exercises for 12 moons across the year</b> echo the
            seasonal properties of each moon. For each of the 12 moons, you'll
            find a unique ritual or exercise for every lunar phase, from new
            moon to waning crescent. These include:
          </p>
          Intention-setting rituals connected to the new moon and full moon
          Exercises centered around growth, including plant care and other
          rituals rooted in nature Meditation and breathwork to help you calm
          and ground yourself Tips for nourishment, deep sleep, and beauty
          rituals to celebrate your body Journaling prompts to help you explore
          your monthly intention Other techniques to help you process your
          emotions and give and receive loving-kindness in everyday life
          <p>
            <br />
            By following the book through the moons of the year, you'll
            <b
              >gain a natural sense of the powers and properties of each season
              and phase of the moon</b
            >, and of which rituals and practices resonate most deeply with you.
            As you incorporate these practices into the rhythm of your days,
            you'll
            <b>find yourself moving in greater harmony with natural cycles</b>,
            and benefiting from your deepening connection to the world around
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>Living Lunarly</i> gives you an accessible yet thorough guide to
            creating a self-care practice linked to the lunar cycle that is
            meaningful, individual, and powerfully healing.

          From the start, <b>Lunarly</b>'s goal was to draw together a community
          under the moon above. They knew there were other people out there who
          cared about setting intentions, connecting with nature, and finding
          meaningful ways to restore their spirit. Today their community is
          thousands strong and while it takes many forms, Lunarly remains a
          place to explore, learn, and share in a journey together. Everything
          Lunarly makes has an intention behind it. They began with their
          monthly self-care boxes themed to the new moon, and filled them with
          carefully selected plants, candles, crystals, and the like. As they've
          grown and expanded their offerings, their enthusiasm has grown too.
          The resounding response from people around the globe bolsters
          Lunarly's commitment to make all they do significant and useful.
          Lunarly welcomes all readers to join the Lunarly community online and
          at home. Come join our community group on Facebook. If you’re
