            The Shadow is the part of us made up of all that we hide from
            others: our shame, our fears and our wounds, but also our divine
            spirit, our blinding beauty and our hidden talents. The Shadow is
            not bad – in fact it is the source of our creativity and power – but
            until we bring it into the light this power will remain untapped and
            our full potential unreached.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Using practical exercises sourced from lucid dreaming and
            dream-work, Tibetan Buddhism and mindfulness meditation, this book
            explores how to:
          </p>
          <p>• Transform the dark and light shadow side</p>
          <p>• Meet the shadow through your dreams</p>
          <p>• Unlock your creativity</p>
          <p>• Transform Nightmares through lucid dreaming</p>
          <p>• Manifest your hidden potential</p>
          <p>• Make friends with fear &amp; anxiety</p>
          <p>• Decrease stress through Mindfulness of Dream &amp; Sleep</p>
          <p>
            This book will show you how to fearlessly embrace your shadow side
            in both your dreams and daily life, thereby manifesting the awakened
            power of your full potential.

          "Charlie Morley has produced not just a self-help book but a guide to
          befriending all of who you truly are. Charlie is the real deal, and
          this book is like being led down a full spiritual journey by an old
          and jovial friend. An honest, compassionate and enjoyable read that
          will lead to incredible self-acceptance and joy."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b

          ><br /><br />"With great lucidity, Charlie Morley show us how, instead
          of hiding from our shadow, rejecting it or indulging it, we can in
          fact integrate it so that we achieve much greater wholeness and
          personal freedom. I learned so much from this book and know I will
          return to it time and time again."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b

          Charlie for a long time and I consider him a very positive influence
          in the world. In this book he guides people in how to be more helpful
          human beings. I strongly believe his authentic confidence and sound
          mind give him the ability to do this."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b

          written a fine book that brings a fresh and modern approach to working
          with the shadow. He has created a pathway to integrate the shadow in a
          down-to-earth and yet inspiring way, led by his own walking-his-talk
          approach to life. Charlie is the real deal. I wholeheartedly recommend
          this book."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Ya’Acov Darling Khan</b>, author of

          ><br /><br />"In this highly authentic and pioneering work, Charlie
          Morley shares his rich experience as one of the world's foremost lucid
          dreamers and offers tips on how every person can train to become lucid
          and aware of their shadows."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Rob Nairn</b>, author of
          <i>Living, Dreaming, Dying</i>"<br /><br />"I have always been
          fascinated by what the ancient Mexicans named the Cave: the place
          where our ancestral patterns, instincts, personal story and highest
          potential reside. This book has offered me new ways to work with my
          own Cave in order to be a better person. I really believe that the
          practices in this book could be life changing for many
          people."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b>Sergio Magaña</b>, author of

          surpasses discussion of dream yoga by inviting the inspired reader
          into the experience itself. To understand the pages ahead is to
          quicken the evolution of one's conscious awakening."&nbsp;-&nbsp;<b
            >Lama Choyin Rangdrol</b
          >, author of <i>Black Buddha</i><br /><br />"A very wise and brilliant
          book by one of Hay House publishers' bright young stars. Extensively
          researched, Charlie's book brings in many fascinating Tibetan Buddhist
          teachings/insights about shadow work, transformation, dreaming and
          lucid dreaming, as well as those from many other traditions and
          teachers. A very contemporary, cutting-edge and inspiring take on this
          subject. And Lucid Dreaming being Charlie's core expertise, there's
          some wonderful guidance on using lucid dreams to powerfully heal and
          and integrate the shadow. I'd hugely recommend this book for anyone
          interested in integrating their shadow and finding their gifts, their
          'gold in the dark' as Jung called it."&nbsp;- <b>Will Gethin</b>,
