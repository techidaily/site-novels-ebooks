          Many of us grapple with how to stay happy, calm, and focused in a
          world that seems to get more complex by the minute. How do we keep our
          wits about us, our mood stable, and our memory intact when our brains
          and bodies are bombarded with information and influences from every
          side? This one-of-a-kind resource combines cutting-edge science with
          compassion and wisdom to offer answers we can really use.<br /><br /><i
            >Heal Your Mind</i
          >
          continues the three-pronged healing approach that Dr. Mona Lisa Schulz
          and Louise Hay pioneered together in
          <i
            >All Is Well: Heal Your Body with Medicine, Affirmations, and
            Intuition</i
          >. Here, it’s applied to aspects of the mind ranging from depression,
          anxiety, and addiction to memory, learning, and even mystical states.
          You’ll learn what’s going on in your brain and body when:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;You
          feel sad, angry, or panicked<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;An
          addictive substance or behavior has hold of you<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;You
          have trouble focusing, reading, or remembering<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;A
          past trauma is clouding your mind in the present<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;An
          emotional state is a clue to a physical ailment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;And
          more<br /><br /><br />And in each chapter, you’ll get a “virtual
          healing experience” through case studies in the All Is Well Clinic,
          where Dr. Mona Lisa uses medical intuition to pinpoint issues in a
          wide range of prototypical client histories and she and Louise offer
          solutions and affirmations to help restore well-being.<br /><br />Today,
          the “pill-for-every-ill” approach is so prevalent that we may think
          our minds and bodies need an endless array of expensive, ever-changing
          pharmaceutical interventions. In truth, medicines are just one
          approach to healing the mind; nutritional supplements give us another
          important way to support mind-body health; and affirmations, as well
          as various forms of therapy, can restore us to balance by changing the
          way we <i>think. Heal Your Mind</i> puts all these tools at your
          disposal to help you choose your own path toward wholeness.
