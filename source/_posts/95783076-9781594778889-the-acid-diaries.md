          An exploration of the personal and spiritual truths revealed through
          LSD <br />
          <br />• Reveals that LSD visions weave an ongoing story from trip to
          trip <br />
          <br />• Shows that trips progress through three stages: personal
          issues and pre-birth consciousness, ego-loss, and on to the sacred
          <br />
          <br />• Explores psychedelic use throughout history, including the
          mass hallucinations common in the Middle Ages and the early
          therapeutic use of LSD <br />
          <br />Toward the end of his fifties, Christopher Gray took, for the
          first time in years, a 100-microgram acid trip. So extraordinary, and
          to his surprise so enjoyable, were the effects that he began to take
          the same dose in the same way--quietly and on his own--once every two
          to three weeks. <br />
          <br />In <i>The Acid Diaries</i>, Gray details his experimentation
          with LSD over a period of three years and shares the startling
          realization that his visions were weaving an ongoing story from trip
          to trip, revealing an underlying reality of personal and spiritual
          truths. Following the theories of Stanislav Grof and offering quotes
          from others’ experiences that parallel his own--including those of
          Aldous Huxley, Albert Hofmann, and Gordon Wasson--he shows that trips
          progress through three stages: the first dealing with personal issues
          and pre-birth consciousness; the second with ego-loss, often with
          supernatural overtones; and the third with sacred, spiritual, and even
          apocalyptic themes. Pairing his experiences with an exploration of
          psychedelic use throughout history, including the ergot-spawned mass
          hallucinations that were common through the Middle Ages and the early
          use of LSD for therapeutic purposes, Gray offers readers a greater
          understanding and appreciation for the potential value of LSD not
          merely for transpersonal growth but also for spiritual development.

          “It is Gray’s foundation in spiritual practices that makes
          <i>The Acid Diaries</i> glow. . . Gray is not some detached scientist.
          Nor is he some drugged our hippie. He writes with an intelligent,
          literate and confessional voice that’s casual, yet never sloppy. . .
          This makes <i>The Acid Diaries</i> an excellent “gateway” book into
          the genre of psychedelic literature for anyone new to the field.”
