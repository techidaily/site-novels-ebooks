            This hardback&nbsp;volume contains both The Key of Solomon the King
            (The Greater Key) and The Lesser Key of Solomon, including all of
            the original illustrations, diagrams and annotations to aid the
            reader in their understanding of the Solomon Key.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Key of Solomon the King was originally researched and translated
            by S.L. MacGregor Mathers from ancient manuscripts in the British
            museums. Included by Mathers is the Order of the Pentacles of
            Solomon, the Ancient Fragment of the Key of Solomon, The Qabalistic
            Invocation of Solomon, and 15 plates full of figures, seals and
            charts, as well as the original text giving detailed instruction for
            spells and invocations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The work is traditionally divided into two books detailing the Key
            of King Solomon. Book One explains the operation of conjurations,
            curses, spells and other magical works. Book Two instructs the
            practitioner on the proper attire, purification rituals and other
            means of obtaining the goals of the Goetia. Between these two books
            is the list of plates that contain numerous illustrations and secret
            seals of Solomon, including the Mystical Seal of Solomon, the
            Pentacles of Solomon, and the Mystical Alphabet, which impart the
            mechanisms and requirements for the invocation of spirits and
            demons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lesser Key of Solomon, or the Clavicula Salomonis Regis, or
            Lemegeton, is a compilation of materials and writings from ancient
            sources making up a text book of magic or “grimoire.” Portions of
            this book can be traced back to the mid-16th to 17th centuries, when
            occult researchers such as Cornelius Agrippa and Johannes
            Trithemisus assembled what they discovered during their
            investigations into their own great works.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a modern grimoire, the Lesser Key of Solomon has seen several
            editions with various authors and editors taking liberty to edit and
            translate the ancient writings and source material. In 1898, Arthur
            Edward Waite published his The Book of Black Magic and of Pacts,
            which contained large portions of the Lemegeton. He was followed by
            Mathers and Crowley in 1904 who published The Goetia: The Lesser Key
            of Solomon. Many others have assembled their own version of this
            ancient material since, and it is important to realize that it is
            the contents rather than the book itself that make up the Lesser
            Key. Traditionally, the source material is divided into five books:
            Ars Goetia, Ars Theurgia Goetia, Ars Paulina, Ars Almadel, and Ars
            Notoria. Mathers and Crowley indicate their edition is a translation
            of the first.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the preface to this edition, it is explained that a “Secret
            Chief” of the Rosicrucian Order directed the completion of the book.
            The original editor was a G. H. Fra. D.D.C.F. who translated ancient
            texts from French, Hebrew, and Latin, but was unable to complete his
            labors because of the martial assaults of the Four Great Princes.
            Crowley was then asked to step in and finish what the previous
            author had begun. Traditionally, S. L. MacGregor Mathers is credited
            as the translator of this edition, and Crowley is given the title of
            editor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scholars believe these books of Solomon and their many iterations
            derive from the ancient practices of Jewish Kabbalah and Arab
            Alchemy. After time, it is thought Greek and Roman influences were
            added until, finally, the work was used and molded by high
            Renaissance magicians. This book, as well as other King Solomon
            books, such as the Magical Treatise of King Solomon and the
            Testament of Solomon, were brought back to modern times through the
            labors of occult practitioners such as S. L. MacGregor Mathers,
            Aleister Crowley and others around the turn of the last century.
