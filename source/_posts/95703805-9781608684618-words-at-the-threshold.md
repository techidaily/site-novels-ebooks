            >What Our Last Words Reveal About Life, Death, and the Afterlife<br /></b
          ><br />A person’s end-of-life words often take on an eerie
          significance, giving tantalizing clues about the ultimate fate of the
          human soul. Until now, however, no author has systematically studied
          end-of-life communication by using examples from ordinary people. When
          her father became terminally ill with cancer, author Lisa Smartt began
          transcribing his conversations and noticed that his personality
          underwent inexplicable changes. Smartt’s father, once a skeptical man
          with a secular worldview, developed a deeply spiritual outlook in his
          final days — a change reflected in his language. Baffled and
          intrigued, Smartt began to investigate what other people have said
          while nearing death, collecting more than one hundred case studies
          through interviews and transcripts. In this groundbreaking and
          insightful book, Smartt shows how the language of the dying can point
          the way to a transcendent world beyond our own.

          “With <i>Words at the Threshold</i>, Lisa Smartt has given the world
          of near death studies a fresh new path for research. Deeply moving and
          meticulously researched, this book offers a feast of fresh information
          about communications with the other side that may take place at the
          time of death. This is an insightful book worth reading.”<br />—
          <b>Paul Perry, </b>coauthor of <i>Glimpses of Eternity</i
          ><br /><br />“Rarely can we say a book has the ability to profoundly
          affect the way we live and think, but <i>Words at the Threshold</i> is
          truly such a book. The research is impeccable, and the insights that
          Lisa Smartt gives us into the realm of the threshold open doors of
          perception that help us understand what it is to be part of the human
          experience.”<br />— <b>Michael Wayne, PhD, LAc, </b>author of
          <i>The Quantum Revolution </i>and producer and host of
          <i>Interviews with the Leading Edge</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Words at the Threshold</i
          >
          is a treasure trove of experience and insight around the last words
          spoken by the dying, as revealed through the mind of a linguist,
          proposing that birth and death are different facets of the same
          process, that both are essential in the cycle of life, and that our
          soul connections do not end with death. The words of the dying provide
          some of the most salient clues as to how we can best live our lives on
          earth.”<br />— <b>Eben Alexander, MD, </b>neurosurgeon and author of
          <i>Proof of Heaven</i> and <i>The Map of Heaven</i><br /><br />“<i
            >Words at the Threshold</i
          >
          marks a new era in the understanding of the process of dying. Lisa
          Smartt’s work has profound psychological, spiritual, and clinical
          implications for the care of terminally ill patients and their
          families. And I believe that her work also opens unexplored pathways
          for the genuinely rational investigation of human kind’s deepest
          mystery: the prospect of life after death.”<br />— from the foreword
          by<b> Raymond Moody Jr., MD, PhD, </b>author of <i>Life After Life</i
          ><br /><br />“Lisa Smartt gently invites us to listen to the
          utterances of the dying with an inner ear attuned to another kind of
          reality. She charts how the dying use eerily familiar metaphors,
          symbols, time loops, and more to express their expanded, nonlinear
          experiences. In so doing, Smartt affords us a precious glimpse of
          their inner worlds as they linger at the threshold of death. Through
          her linguistic analysis of ‘nonsense’ on the lips of the dying, the
          underlying creativity and purpose of final words are revealed.
          <i>Words at the Threshold</i> is a significant step toward
          transforming the current views of dying from a process of failure into
          a process of ever-deepening meaning and wonder.”<br />—
          <b>Julia Assante, PhD, </b>author of<i> The Last Frontier</i
          ><br /><br />“The many suggestions about engaging loved ones as they
          die and the cogent advice on ways to provide a more peaceful passing
          give the volume considerable value.”<br />—
          <b><i>Booklist</i><br /><br /></b>“Books like
          <i>Words at the Threshold</i> by Lisa Smartt only come along every now
          and again and when they do they shine out as publications that
          genuinely break new ground and greatly expand our understanding of the
          mysteries of life and death. Highly recommended as an essential
          read.”<br />— <b><i>Spirituality Today</i></b
