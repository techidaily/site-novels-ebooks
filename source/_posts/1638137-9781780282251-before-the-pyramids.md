            >This page-turning study of the Giza pyramids, British henges, and
            the megalithic measuring system “could completely change the way we
            view our remote past…and origins” (Robert G. Bauval, author of
            <i>The Orion Mystery</i>)</b
          ><br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          The suggestion that the Giza pyramids were laid out to represent the
          stars of Orion’s belt, with the position of the River Nile reflecting
          the Milky Way, was first put forward by the renowned author Robert
          Bauval in his bestselling book&nbsp;<i>The Orion Mystery.</i>
          In&nbsp;<i>Before the Pyramids</i>,&nbsp;Christopher Knight and Alan
          Butler reveal that the British henges were arranged in the same
          formation—but much earlier. They also present irrefutable evidence
          that the astronomical calculations determining the layout of the
          pyramids could only have been made from the site of the henges in
          North Yorkshire. From this they can conclude that the pyramids of the
          pharaohs were conceived and planned in Britain.<br />
          &nbsp;<br />
          Their next stunning discovery takes us to modern times. They have
          found evidence that the whole Megalithic measuring system has survived
          into the 20th century. There are examples in Washington, DC—even in
          the positioning and construction of the Pentagon, which was only
          commenced in 1942 and is an exact copy of the dimensions of
          Stonehenge, dating to 3,000 BC.

          'A major breakthrough at last! Knight and Butler's stunning discovery
          could completely change the way we view our remote past... and
          origins.' Robert G. Bauval, author of The Orion Mystery 'Absolutely
          fascinating, and very, very convincing. Knight and Butler's findings
          provide compelling scientific evidence of the existence of an
          advanced, technological civilisation in remote antiquity.'
