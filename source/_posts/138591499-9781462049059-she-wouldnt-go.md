          Based upon true events, She Wouldn't Go! The Haunting is the story of
          Janie and her struggles with one unforgettable spirit. When Janie was
          young, she was taught how to read the Tarot Cards by her Grandma
          Vicky, who possessed special knowledge of the spirit world. Her
          grandmother tells her that she is teaching Janie about the cards
          because she is special; only later will Janie understand how important
          this is for her. Janie is aware there is something different about her
          because she has begun to have premonitions and bad dreams of things to
          come.When Janie grows up, she meets and falls in love with Bobby; they
          marry. As most young couples do, they buy their very first home. As
          they move in, it's an exciting time for them; soon, they learn that
          they will be adding a child to their family. They are overjoyed with
          this news and know that theirs will be a happy home. But once their
          son, Edward, is born, strange things begin to happen in their home.
          They soon discover there is a very persistent spirit in their home-the
          spirit of a young girl who wants to take the place of their son
          because she is enthralled by Edward's mother's love for him. She wants
          that love-but what might it cost Janie and her family?
