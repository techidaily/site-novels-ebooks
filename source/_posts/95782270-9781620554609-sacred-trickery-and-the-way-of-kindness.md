          Enter the mind of Jodo and follow his initiatory saga from Zen
          disciple to revolutionary filmmaker to spiritual teacher<br /><br />•
          Explores the sacred trickery of shamans he encountered, including
          Carlos Castaneda, and how intention and action matter more than
          notions of “true” and “false”<br /><br />• Explains the Way of
          Kindness and how small acts of generosity and goodness can have a
          profound effect on your spirit, infusing life with a wealth of
          happiness<br /><br />• Includes contributions from friends and
          students of Jodorowsky on their experiences with him, including his
          son Adan Jodorowsky <br /><br />Known for his surrealist films, his
          unique approach to tarot, his symbolic comics, and his shamanic
          therapeutic method of psychomagic, Alejandro Jodorowsky has
          accomplished an extraordinary amount in his more than 80 years. In
          this book, we get an intimate look into the inner workings of the cult
          figure of Jodo. What is revealed is a man who has evolved since his
          groundbreaking films of the 1970s, <i>El Topo</i> and
          <i>The Holy Mountain</i>, a man who has grown from a sacred trickster,
          a shaman of psychomagic, into a brilliant spiritual maverick of the
          21st century. We get to see Jodo’s own reflections on the rich
          tapestry of his remarkable life, including the initiatory failure of
          the Dune film project, which combined the talents of a multitude of
          creative greats, including Moebius, Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, Mick
          Jagger, and H. R. Giger. We learn about Jodo’s years with Marcel
          Marceau and with great masters such as Ejo Takata, whose Zen training
          featured strenuous physical and mental ordeals; the sorceress Pachita,
          who performed psychic surgery on Jodo; and the mysterious Carlos
          Castaneda, whose sacred trickery reveals how intentions matter more
          than notions of “true” and “false.” <br /><br />Discussing the Way of
          Kindness that he now follows, Jodo reveals how intentionally
          practicing small acts of generosity and goodness can have a profound
          effect on your spirit, infusing life with a wealth of happiness.
          <br /><br />From sacred trickery to the path of kindness, Jodo’s
          radical wisdom discerns the timeless within the immediate and gauges
          the everyday by the measure of eternity.
