          In an attractive, oversized format, enlivened with illustrations,
          sidebar quotes, personal accounts, techniques to try, and profiles of
          leaders in the field, <b>Discovering the Body's Wisdom</b> is a basic
          resource for well-being and natural health.<br /><br />Body
          disciplines and therapies have enjoyed phenomenal growth in the past
          decade, becoming a major alternative to mainstream medicine and
          traditional psychotherapy. But with more than 100,000 practitioners
          and dozens of methods available in the United States alone, how can
          consumers choose the right one for themselves?<br /><br />Mirka
          Knaster's richly informative guide provides an overview of the
          principles and theories underlying the major Eastern and Western body
          therapies, or "bodyways." It shows readers how to befriend their own
          bodies, getting back in touch with their internal sources of health
          and wisdom. It also describes more than 75 individual approaches,
          answering such questions as: How does each therapy work? What can we
          expect from one session or a series? What are the reasons for
          selecting this method? How do we find a qualified practitioner? What,
          if any, are the "consumer-bewares"?

        </h4>
        <p>
          Mirka Knaster was born in Europe and raised in New York City. Her
          life-long experience of living, traveling, and conducting research in
          different parts of the world have contributed to her cross-cultural
          perspective on how people view, take care of, and heal their
          bodies.<br /><br />A licensed massage therapist who has trained in
          diverse body methods and disciplines, she has been involved in the
          alternative health field for more than twenty years. As a contributing
          editor of <i>East/West</i> (now <i>Natural Health</i>) and
          <i>Massage Therapy Journal</i>, she has interviewed many of the
          field’s luminaries and reported on the latest trends. Her writing on
          health and other subjects has appeared in a wide variety of
          publications, including <i>The Washington Post</i>,
          <i>Ladies’ Home Journal</i>, and
          <i>Women’s Health Care: A Guide to Alternatives</i>. She was a
          consultant, writer, and on-screen instructor for the best-selling
          video “Massage for Health,” hosted by Shari Belafonte.<br /><br />Prior
          to her work in holistic health, Mirka was a Ford Foundation Fellow at
          Stanford University’s Center for Latin American Studies and taught
          English in Colombia. She also did research and published academically
          in the field of women’s studies.
