          • Explains specifically how to initiate contact with angels and spirit
          guides, how to recognize their signs, and how to appeal to your
          guardian angel <br /><br />• Reveals the various forms angels take,
          from archangels to guardian angels, their strong desire to assist us,
          and how they can help you find your soul’s purpose <br /><br />•
          Shares real stories of angelic assistance for common problems, from
          financial matters to emotional and physical healing to finding new
          love after heartbreak <br /><br />Even if you are unaware of their
          presence, angels are always available to help you. If you have
          experienced a lucky break or happy coincidence, it was most likely
          orchestrated by your guardian angel. And, as Robbie Holz reveals, if
          we give angels permission to enter our lives, if we ask for their help
          in navigating life’s many challenges, their assistance is much more
          profound and effective. <br /><br />In this step-by-step guide to
          calling on angels and benevolent spirit guides, Holz explores how to
          initiate and nurture your angelic relationships and engage their
          powerful assistance to overcome struggles and manifest your desires.
          She explains the various forms angels take--from archangels to
          guardian angels, their strong desire to help us, and how the angelic
          realm assists humanity. The author reveals specifically how to contact
          angels and spirit guides, how to recognize their signs, and how to
          differentiate between guidance from your own mind and from the angels.
          She provides exercises and guided meditations to help strengthen your
          intuition and develop a closer connection to your celestial team.
          <br /><br />Sharing real stories of angelic assistance, Holz shows how
          our celestial guides can help with financial matters, job searches,
          and dealing with difficult people. They can help those who need
          physical and emotional healing as well as offer relief from stress,
          anxiety, fears, self-doubt, self-hatred, and depression. Your
          spiritual team can aid in mending damaged relationships and finding
          love after heartbreak, helping you to open your heart once again. They
          can also support you in discovering your soul’s purpose, accelerating
          conscious evolution, and shifting into the love-based fifth dimension.
          <br /><br />By engaging your angelic team, you will have access to a
          powerful and unlimited source of help that is always on call and
          always ready to work miracles on your behalf.
