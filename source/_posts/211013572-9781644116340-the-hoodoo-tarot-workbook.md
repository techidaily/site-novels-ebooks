          • Provides rituals for each of the Major Arcana cards and shares
          exercises for resolving problems and dysfunctional patterns the cards
          reveal<br /><br />• Explores in depth the plants, herbs, and flowers
          of the Hoodoo tradition featured on the cards<br /><br />• Offers
          eleven new card spreads, such as the New Moon spread, the Big House
          Healing Trauma spread, and the Difficult Ancestry spread<br /><br />In
          this Hoodoo and divination workbook, Tayannah Lee McQuillar presents a
          deeper understanding of the concepts, themes, and symbology featured
          in her best-selling <i>Hoodoo Tarot</i> card deck, along with
          providing rituals, botanical knowledge, and advanced practices for
          working with the cards.<br /><br />Exploring the philosophy behind
          Hoodoo as well as its historical and spiritual roots, the author looks
          at this tradition as a nature-based spiritual system, emphasizing the
          unique environmental features of the Deep South that have shaped what
          Hoodoo and Rootwork are today. She explores in depth the plants,
          herbs, and flowers of the Hoodoo tradition featured on the cards as
          well as the animals that play a totemic role in Root­working. She
          explains the three sacred circles of Hoodoo and the different groups
          whose spiritual traditions give this syncretic faith its complex
          heritage: early Black American Christianity, esoteric European
          traditions, and Indigenous American traditions. <br /><br />Looking at
          the Elder cards (Major Arcana) of <i>The Hoodoo Tarot,</i> the author
          provides rituals to work with each of the cards and the plants,
          legendary figures, and the spiritual concepts they represent. She
          offers eleven new card spreads, such as the New Moon spread, the Big
          House Healing Trauma spread, and the Difficult Ancestry spread. She
          also looks closely at the Family card connections, explaining what
          particular cards reveal when they appear.<br /><br />Presenting new
          ways to work with <i>The Hoodoo Tarot,</i> this book also provides a
          foundational introduction to the Rootworking tradition, allowing
          divination practitioners and spiritual seekers alike to expand their
          journeys of growth and understanding.

          “Tayannah takes a step ahead on oracle reading with this book. Much
          more than only providing counsel or fortune advice, the exercises and
          meditations from <i>The Hoodoo Tarot Workbook</i> are powerful tools
          for self-knowledge and self-growth, no matter which faith the reader
          practices. She also brings light to the mysteries of leaves and charm
          magic as well as important lessons on how to create magic in daily
          life guided by the tarot cards and their wisdom messages. The
          historical chapters are a must-read, especially because they reveal
          and reinforce the non-Christian aspects of Hoodoo and its founder
          practitioners. The illustrated plant dictionary and descriptions of
          their magic uses are a highlight for all magic lovers, Rootworkers or
          not. Along with the guide to the plants, the Elder cards’ rituals are
          very interesting and show how Hoodoo and Black America folk magic
          relates with other diasporic traditions such as Brazilian Umbanda and
          Jurema.”
